			<div class="content">Pull up a chair, I've got a story for ya.  I just found out that my ISP decided to block another ISP because they had customers complain about the amount of spam coming from the other domain.  So some knucklehead flipped a switch and that was their solution.  <b> EXCUSE ME  </b> but what about all the other cusotmers that were NOT complaining and are no loinger recieving email from the blocked ISP?  I am sooo pissed I'm seeing red.  Here's the kicker, my only avenue of complaint is to send them an email.  <b> EXCUSE ME  </b> you mean I can not speak with a living breathing human being about this?  So this is a copy of most of the original message I just got done sending my current ISP.

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />Addressed to:  <!-- e --><a href="mailto:abuse@sbcglobal.net">abuse@sbcglobal.net</a><!-- e -->
<br />
<br />To whom it may concern,
<br /> 
<br />My name is Robert Lordier.  I've been a customer of Ameritech and now SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) for well over a year and have had zero problems with the service...until now.
<br /> 
<br />Before I switched to broadband I was with a small local company called Be On line.  I was always a happy customer with them and showed me excellent customer service.  At times I even helped them during some of their growing years since I was with them for so many years and I'm not like most customers that don't know how to turn on a computer.  Their service was so good I consistently recommended them to friends and family.  When I left them to go to broadband they were kind enough to forward all my email message that were going to my old address (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:pierre@beol.net">pierre@beol.net</a><!-- e -->) to my new address (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:p1erre@ameritech.net">p1erre@ameritech.net</a><!-- e -->).  They have been kind enough to allow this forwarding to go on for almost two years.  Last Thursday, the 8th of April at approximately 5 pm something happened.  I was no longer getting any emails that were routed through my old Be On Line email address.  I contact Be On Line and had them verify all my information was correct on the forward flag.  I didn't have a chance to check things Friday but spent the weekend and today trying to &quot;ping&quot; my old <!-- e --><a href="mailto:pierre@beol.net">pierre@beol.net</a><!-- e --> email address to see if it would find its way through.  Nothing came through.
<br /> 
<br />I called Be On Line again today and had the re-verify the info and at that point, they tried to send an email test to my Ameritech.net email address and got a bounceback saying their domain has been blacklisted by SBC DSL.  I have been on the phone with SBC DSL representative and Yahoo representative for over 45 minutes today trying to sort out this problem.  The last person I spoke with informed me this was the ONLY avenue to pursue to open the portal opened back up.  Now it's time for me to get a few things off my chest.
<br /> 
<br />First of all, out of the 3 representatives I spoke with from DSL SBC Yahoo (whatever) two were extremely courteous but could not help me and forwarded my phone call to another office.  I got nowhere with the first two but the last rep I spoke with informed me this was the ONLY avenue to get this matter resolved.  The rep was not very nice to me when I brought up my displeasure of ONLY having this email message to get my point across.  She said something like there's been a lot of complaints from current SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) customers about Spam originating from Be On Line mail servers.  I could give a rats ass about other people complaining about Spam.  To me, they're just lazy.  Spam is not going to go away anytime soon and BLOCKING another ISP is NOT the solution here folks.  If every ISP in the world did that then email would ground to a complete halt.  All electronic email messages from Be On Line addressed to Ameritech.net domains have been blocked and I want it opened I M M E D I A T E L Y.
<br /> 
<br />How can a company like SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) simply flip a switch and block another ISP and not worry about the rest of the customers that were NOT complaining (like me) suddenly losing what might be costing customers some serious money or correspondence by carte blanch blocking another ISP completely?  What kind of email policy is that?  I have had my <!-- e --><a href="mailto:pierre@beol.net">pierre@beol.net</a><!-- e --> email address for almost a decade and now I am not receiving some very important messages because some OTHER SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) customers complained?  Excuse me??  Those other customers that complained about all the Spam coming from Be On Line email servers need to be more proactive about who they give their email addresses to, get better at dealing with Spam themselves and stop depending on SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) to clean up their own messes.  
<br /> 
<br />Turn the portal back on so email can come from Be On Line email server  to Ameritech's email server and the next time you want to be proactive about dealing with Spam, start educating the customers on what they can do themselves to prevent Spam from showing up in their inbox.  Hasn't anyone every heard of message rules, blocking users locally or worse yet DELETING messages?  SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) could just as easily informed those that were complaining of some of these alternatives to blocking Spam rather that simply flipping a switch and cutting EVERYONE off.  Whoever made the decision to do this should be canned and put out of a job.  
<br /> 
<br />SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) didn't notify ANY of their customers they were going to do this.  Bad move folks, now you've got at least one current paying customer extremely pissed off.  I didn't even have an OPTION to speak with a living breathing human that could fix this issue.  Another bad move.
<br /> 
<br />I expect and demand a response within 24 hours or my poison email pen will just get that much sharper.  I wouldn't be this mad if I would have had the OPTION to speak directly with another living breathing human being like I was able to with good 'ol Be On Line.  My SBC DSL Yahoo (whatever) trouble ticket number = 42946212

<br />Can you tell I'm a little irate?  I can not believe this is &quot;policy.&quot;  I am so pissed off right now my head is psinning.  How DARE they do this.  Butt-munchers.

			<div class="content">I feel your pain, twin bro.  I've had a similar situation, but with an insurance company rather than an ISP. 
<br />
<br />Trying to keep this short, but it's been going like this:  In July, I had major surgery.  Since then, they simply stopped paying all claims for reasons they couldn't even explain.  Yes, the surgery was expensive, but that's why we pay the absurdly large premiums to them.  This is why we have insurance, right?  Anyway, since July, I've been battling with them, as well as my doctor's offices, to force them to pay their claims which, under contract, they were obligated to do.  Well, after I don't know how many calls and emails, I threatened to report them to the Insurance Commissioner for the state I live in.  The Insurance Commission isn't your typical bureaucratic agency.  When they get complaints like this, they act on them within days.  So, the time I gave them (10 days to make good on claims or you're reported) came and went.  I then had my attorney email them stating the reporting was going to happen the next day, and he faxed them all the documents prepared for this reporting.  Well, gee, wouldn't you know it, the claims began to get paid the next day.  I've learned that being courteous with idiots such as these gets you nowhere.  From now on, I use threats backed up with my attorney immediately.  
<br />I'm now fighting with my former employer, where they claim I owe them about $2,000 for various things.  I won't bore you with the details, but a negligent act on their part was the cause of this billing.  I wrote a letter, cc'd to my attorney, threatening legal action if this isn't dropped immediately due to their error.  I haven't heard from them since.  
<br />I guess what the old saying is is true  &quot;Nice guys finish last&quot;.  
<br />Keep fighting my twin bro, and get very nasty and threaten with legal action (even if that's bull---t)  Only way to get them to move is to get them scared they'll lose money in a settlement.  Worked for me, twice!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />All this is just crazy. But Stinger, I'm with you hometown bro!We can't let people who are richer than us take advatage of us like this.
<br />
<br />Oh, and meezoo, some websites ban webmail like hotmail and yahoo because it's free and its easier to create multiple accounts.
