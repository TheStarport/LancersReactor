			<div class="content">Good for you! A little extra safeguard, so this kind of thing doesn't happen again. Go to Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; System Restore (It's a tab at the top) and make sure it's turned &quot;ON&quot; and make a system restore point. You can access System Resotre and make a System Resotre point through Start Menu -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Through this you can simply restore your computer to what it was when it just started, or at any other System Restore point, which is very convienant, and better than reformatting all the time.
<br />
<br />Special Notes: Make sure you virus scan before you create a System Restore point. Creating a virus backup will cause large amounts of problems because System Restore has to be turned OFF for a virus scan to scan the back ups, because Windows puts those files under protection. It's also suggested you set up and configure all utilitzes suchs as virus scanners, firewall, netwrok settings etc. (basically the tedious stuff that you don't want to be repeating) and then make the restore point so you don't have to do that stuff again. If you want more System Rstore points (Windows will trash the older ones every now and then to save space), allocate more hard drive space to System Restore by using the slider in the System Restore tab.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi again!
<br />
<br />Good to hear that your comp is allright again King Lin! I hope FL will work now and you will like the mod. Have Fun playing!
<br />
<br />Vader: Don't be to rough to the gunship pilot <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Dreyus:
<br />
<br />I try to make this as short as possible <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> but I have to answer to your last long post.
<br />
<br />6. You might be right with this. But there is one important thing. The Order is not actively attacking the Nomads in their systems like the Monkeys and Robots do. The Order is only defending Sirius and the old systems from the Nomads. Therefore they are not taking part in the war as much as the Monkeys,Robots and Nomads. Only these three factions are really attacking each other in all the new systems. The Order is only defending the Unknown 1 system, Omicron Alpha and they have some small patrols in Nomad 1, just to realize a larger invasion of the Nomads earlier.
<br />
<br />7. I will of course try to do it in a way that the player cannot have all the special abilities at once. For example, only the Monkey powerplants deliver enough energy to fire their weapons for a longer time. So, if used on another fighter, you cannot shoot them for so long, as the powerplant is not good enough. The same for the Thruster capacity of the Robot powerplant. All other powerplants will run out of Thrust capacity faster, if someone uses the Robot Thruster.
<br />
<br />For the hull not going down, I might think about decreasing the amount of Nanobots the NPCs carry (although I already decreased these and the shieldbatteries from the last version). And I will make torpedoes much less agile. The Nomad torpedo will still be fast enough to use it against fighters (it will be the only one, which can be used against fighters), but it will hit them less times.
<br />So the player is forced to normally use energy weapons (maybe also the new missiles) to destroy fighters.
<br />
<br />For the bomber type ship: I think, if I decrease the speed and agility of torps like I said it above, these ships would not be too strong, but only good capship-killers. The other ship type ideas I will try to improve and see, if I can find some others.
<br />
<br />For the second idea I was not sure. Of course it might be the ultimate combination, but it would be very expensive and also very dangerous. If you do not hit your enemy (because the projectiles are going very slow) you could not fire for a long time (low refire-rate) and you would be very vulnerable during this time. But maybe I could also try to find some other solution.
<br />
<br />And finally for the capships again:
<br />At first one important thing: You said that it would be possible to get a Titan or Sabre during the storyline. This is not possible. Of course you could just earn enough money to get to the required level, but, if you play the story, in the last mission you will still be level 18. Not less and not more. This is fixed, so that you can just have an Anubis or a similar ship.
<br />But I did not only mean the story, but also OpenSP play. What I thought was, that a player with a Barracuda (just as an example), who comes to Kusari space for the first time, should be able to at least flee, if he is attacked by Kusari capships. If I would make these ships stronger than they are now, this would be very hard, as only very few shots would destroy the ship, even if it was totally loaded with bots and bats. And it can normally also not flee, if the cruise-charge time is very short, as there are normally many fighters around, which are equipped with cruise-disruptors.
<br />Therefore I let the house capships like they are. Of course one could say that low level players should not be able to play as pirate, because this should be for high level players. Therefore I could strengthen the house capships. But I think that first it is already very hard for low level players to play as a pirate and second the player should everytime and on every level have as many possibilities as possible. The last thing is, that even in a Titan or Sabre it is not just boring to fight the house capships. Only an Anubis MK2 pilot might think it is boring, but for him there are the Nomad capships or the Monkey/Robot capships. The Nomad capships I might strengthen a bit, but I have to think about this.
<br />I hope you aggree with these arguments.
<br />
<br />To have NPC-only Nanobots and shieldbatteries would be easy to do. The NPCs already got their own Crusher and Amun (they got clones of the flyable ones with some changes, which are necessary). So I could do this and I will probably do so.
<br />
<br />Of course the differences of the shipclasses are not so clear everytime (some light fighters are better than heavy fighters in every situation), but I think this is not a problem. I just want the player to have some more possibilities and to be able to choose a ship, which is totally specialized on one thing. So someone could choose a ship that is very strong in his favourite &quot;fight-style&quot;.
<br />
<br />Thanks again for all the good suggestions and also thanks for helping King Lin. I already thought about telling him to format his harddrive, but did not want him to have so much work. But finally it has been the best solution after all. Also a good point with the system restore point. I'm also using these quite often.
<br />
<br />That's it for now!
<br />
<br />See you all around.
<br />

			<h3><a href="#p360533" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Your answers are quite correct and it'll do little for me to argue, so instead I'll ask questions on where your taking this mod<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>, unless of course your saving up for a  neat surprise.
<br />
<br />6.  Just what is the Order doing then? Orillion is off talkingot the houses, and the rest are just defending? (This makes more sesne than you might originally think, The Order got decimated to a few dozen ships by the end of SP, I just thought maybe they might do more.)
<br />
<br />Thats it for not argueing though<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> lol.
<br />7. I'm unsure of the effectiveness of that ideal, Nomad 3 lasers for example eat up energy like popcorn, but torpedoes don't, so maybe increasing the energy of those (LARGELY increasing lol) might help instead? As for stopping a player from recieveing the best of the best all around in weapons, equiptment, etc. it is, I think, largely unstoppable, as increasing the energy usage of something means simply that after destroying each fighter (in a colossal alpha strike, for anyone familair with the Mechwarrior series, firing all weapons at once), and then to compensate, simply dodge for a few seconds (which is much easier when your not trying to fire weapons). The only two solutions I can think of to this is eitehr hardpointing certain items to certain hardpoints which sounds very comlpicated (and probably is ie. creating only two hardpoints which can hold Nomad equiptment while all others can't, etc.) or to drastically increase the energy usage of all weapons while increasing the total energy capacity of each power plant, but lowering the regen rate. I'm still unsure of all of this, as it's purely concept stuff, and I have nothing to test these ideas on, perhaps we have to wait until you jsut try in the next version.
<br />
<br />As for the hull not going down, I believe its cause the Monkey weapons do 1.4x damage to shields, but still only 1x to hull, and I'm not used to that (I haven't even tried to use Robot weapons, they are inferior in statistics alone). I guses I just have to get used to that, although its annoying to see a dozen Robot ships firing at a single Mystere (quite a specticle) at less than 1/3rd hll and no shield,yet not destroy it because it somehow survives (perhaps only then doe it use it's nanotbots?) and simply cruises away. Of course you can always pursue but then you become more of a single ship by single ship assassin than a front line fighter.
<br />A crazy idea might be to even out the hull and shield damages of Robot, Monkey, and Order weapons, increased hull damage by a factor of 1.2 shield damage ( probably 1:1 shield to hull damage ratio for the Nomads) and give all NPCs those intesting armour upgrades (don't forget the colony ships too!). 
<br />
<br />The second idea bit was also discussed above. Other solutions are recommended! I'm pretty much blank here.
<br />
<br />Actually you kinda said you could, I might've misunderstood this though, but if you have a Titan or Sabre fighting capital ships, then you alrady ahve to be past the stroyline, and therefore you have access to the other ships...so it's largely pointless? And having the mighty Corsairs toned down a bit against capital ships might explain why they only have a few of Rheinlands ships and not the entire Rheindland fleet (nice addition btw! Abosolutley hilarious, though I kinda feel bad for Rhiendland. Somehow I can picture the Corsairs doing it, they just happen to be fighting everyone at once, which was a stupid idea by them, but probably unavoidable.)
<br />
<br />Quote: &quot;I want a single player to be able to play my mod and stand against anny enemy he will find (Of course not if there are several wings, but at least one group of ships should not be too much for a player) and I want also players, which have &quot;only&quot; a Titan or Sabre to be able to stand at least for a short time and some battles in the new systems. So the new capships must not be too strong.
<br />This is, why you may find the new capships too weak, if flying an Anubis, a Mystere or a similar ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />As for a Barracuda escaping? it doesn't sound terribly difficult, the way I used to escape is use your thrusters to get out of laser range then cruise away, although a cruise disruptor kinda disrupts that, but that just makes life difficult, so just try again. Honestly it's really the least you can expect, from firing on a capital ship some 100x your size AND is fleet of escort fighters and neightbours who are ticked you attacked their allies. A bit of a rant I'm sure, but honestly, at the very least, it'll rethink some of the actions and stuff you can actually pull off. 
<br />
<br />I realize I'm suggesting a total revamp of the combat system (largely in its difficulty) but I think thats a good think, as SP was quite easy, and thinks like engaging the Rheindland fleet actually be terrifying for once. Maybe it might be something I might try sometime on the side as a BETA or something, just to see how it works.
<br />
<br />The nanobots should workout, glad you agree.
<br />
<br />Ship class argueing is rather pointless, so I don't mind in the least, I think I'm a bit of a traditionalist in that though. but change is good so might as well do it.
<br />
<br />Lets hope everyone can back to playing now that computers are working again. 
<br />
<br />I'm curious, what is Vader's fan fiction? Where could I find that?</div>

			<div class="content">Hi This is Vader{MERCS}, please forgive me for this but after all the long posts i've seen,i thought ' why the hell not...? '
<br />
<br />                              ' THE ROBOTS'-Part 1.By Vader{MERCS},based on the FREELANCER ' MONKEYS - MOD ' universe by ' BLACK EAGLE '(Monkey Mod Magic)
<br />
<br />It is the 31st century , and life as we know it....has changed.For a long time now , due to advanced technology , man has left the confinement of Earth , and has taken his place .., amongst the stars.These outter regions of space , this infinite wonder , is now ,what Man calls home.The Final Frontier.
<br />                  Many tales can be told of Mans will to survive in this vastness of Space.Tales of War and alliances...,discovery and loss.This is one such tale.Set deep in the star Constellation known only as 'SIRIUS' .It is a tale of a man like you and i. A man just trying to survive and give his own slice of contribution. A man not afraid of the Unknown , not afraid of Chance , Fate or even death. That is until now .....
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Victor.Sierra,Bounty-Hunters,MERCS division.Come in Freeport-9,over&quot;. The opening transmission cuts the eerie hum of the cruise-engines like a knife. &quot;This is Freeport-9.We read you loud and clear Victor, Sierra,MERCS.Do you have Quadrant clearance? over&quot;. My name is Vader...Vader Sith.With the four main Capital houses (Rheinland,Bretonia,Liberty and Kusari,descendants of an older culture which had once occupied Earth ) always growing , the need for security forces also grew.I had always seen it as an obligation to protect the ideals of free sanctions ,prosperity and the shared advancement of civillised technology.&quot;Sending Q.C.(Quadrant clearance)data to you now , over&quot;.With sub-factions and Radical-Movements also growing , Sirius was now becoming a dangerous place , hence the reason i became a Bounty-Hunter, working with the security forces of each main house.
<br />        Able to overlook normal jurestiction, and when neccessary..,normal methods when apprehending the most dangerous of criminals,I am out of Colonial territory and am on assignment right now.  'AZAR Diablo' , one of Bretonia's most deadly known terrorists.He is of the 'OUTCASTS , a terrorists organization, sometimes known for intercepting military communications,shipments and technologies.He was lastspotted jumping out of Bretonia space and heading to the  'Omicron' systems(these are border regions of SIRIUS, a lot of sectors are still unchartered , providing a cover for some of these more powerful terrorists factions)
<br />      My mission is to set up a recon position in the vicinity of a Large civillian Space-station located in these parts,Freeport-9. A highly skilled pilot and ex-Bounty-Hunter ,' POWERDOLL', is now working as a security official / advisor for the 'ZONERS' aboard this Gigantic Space-station oasis.He is an old friend of mine.
<br />&quot;This is Victor.Sierra,MERCS,requesting a direct security coded frequency comm. link with Sector / Quad Master, code Papa-Delta, nine dash one,over&quot;.An ultra high static frequency channel was required when communicating with high ranking officers.Bounty-Hunters and flight officers of the Naval and Security forces are all issued with decoder/scrambled receptor comm.links.&quot;This is Freeport-9, your request is granted, commencing direct comm.link channel now,over&quot;.
<br />&quot;Thank you Freeport-9,cutting open transmission now ,over&quot;.I switch channels to talk to my old friend.
<br />&quot;Vader , is this you?&quot; POWERDOLL's voice comes through to my link. &quot;Yo ,yeah its me!&quot;,i reply.
<br />&quot;You old son of a gun, what the hell you doing all the way out here? How the hell are ya?&quot;.He seems too happy too hear my voice?, maybe the private sector with higher cred's isn't as hands -on as he first thought?.&quot;Ahh ,it seems we're having a bit of trouble with old 'AZAR again&quot;.
<br /> POWERDOLL had once lost one of his top pilots when he was a Guild Master for the Bounty-Hunters to this elusive and Dangerous terrorists.The mention of his name stirs old memories in POWERDOLLS mind.&quot;Azar?.....AZAR DIABLO?!&quot;.His tone quickly changes.
<br />&quot;Yes...Diablo&quot;, i answer.There is a brief pause , then in a more quiet , ominously calm tone he replies,&quot;You better watch your back..,hes good..,real good....,tell me what you need ?&quot;.I knew i could rely on POWERDOLL.&quot;Nothing at this point my friend, i'm only gathering recon for the moment.Intelligence suspects there may be a jump-hole around these parts leading to 'Omicron Gamma 'that he might be using.I only have to find out how true this is is and get word back to Bretonia. i have agents waiting in the 'Tau 'systems ( neighboring star-systems under Bretonian rule) but i was wondering if you wouldn't mind keeping an eye out for me, you know?...check up from time to time?&quot; In the same tone as before, POWERDOLL sends his reply.&quot;You got it..., you just be carefull out there ok?... watch your back&quot;. POWERDOLLS confirmation is a relief cause no matter how long you've been out here, you can never be too carefull!.
<br />&quot;I will chief,talk to you in about two hours, over and out&quot;.
<br />                  As i speed off, i cant help but watch  Freeport-9 get smaller and smaller behind me as i delve deeper into space.I've been deep in Space plenty of times, seen the 'Omega's'  through to the 'Sigma's '. There is nothing new to me...,but you never know .
<br />     As i near my stake-out point i de-activate the Turbines of my cruise engines.Having my cover blown from cruise-engine residue is the last thing i need , mind you, the Armour Upgraded L1 panels i had attached from B.E.P.E.(BLACK-EAGLE-PERFORMANCE-ENHANCERS) should come in handy if i run into a spot of trouble.I better set up and wait.
<br />         Still no leads on the jump-hole or AZAR and its been almost two hours now.I'd better send that transmission through to POWERDOLL back at Freeport-9.I haven't seen or heard anything yet, except  traders and Space-trains( and the odd lower licenced outcast shipping Cardimine which is too low a hazard to give away my position!) Maybe i should try another sector? anyway,better call POWERDOLL.&quot;POWERDOLL, this is Vader,come in POWERDOLL , over&quot;.The decoder communicator is weak at such great distances , yet POWERDOLL is still able to receive the coded transmission.Crackling , his voice comes up on the comm.link. &quot;I'm receiving you Vader, but the transmission is weak, how is everything out there? found anything?&quot;. &quot;Thats a negative POWERDOLL. I haven't seen squat, maybe intelligence was wrong? I'm heading to new Sector co-ordinates 6-C&quot;. Abrubtly POWERDOLL interrupts.&quot;Hey ,maybe i should suit up and head out there?&quot;. With a chuckle i reply &quot;Heh heh, i was waiting for you to say th......,hey wait!&quot;
<br />Suddenly , two more ships showed up on my scanner H.U.D., and they weren't freighters or space trains!.&quot;I'm picking up two approaching vessels on my scanner of Border design signature.They're almost in range for a hull scan&quot;.
<br />&quot;is that him ?&quot;,POWERDOLL ask's then anxiously , waits for an answer. &quot;Hang -on.....,Affirmative , its him! and he's only got a light fighter escort!screw intelligence , this might be my chance .I'm going in!&quot;.As i throw the turbines into full throttle , i can hear POWERDOLL over the comm.link.&quot;Vader wait! ....Vader!&quot;.His voice dissappears as i go out of the decoders/scramblers range.I cant give up this oppurtunity.
<br />     Racing through a gas-cloud ,i gradually shorten the distance between me and AZAR, but what's this? im picking up a major gravitational force on my scanners? could it be that jump-hole? both ships are heading in that direction.It must be!
<br /> I take a deep breath as i activate my weapons systems.Its now or never.Im approaching a clearing in the gas-cloud, better slow down so i can keep myself concealed until the right moment.There he is! and hes using an unchartered jump-hole!,just as intelligence suspected. I'll quickly punch in the co-ordinates to my NAV map.I'm going to wait till he's almost through before i start docking sequence. I should be able to sneak up behind him...but i dont want to give him a chance to set up an ambush..., that is, if he knows i'm here...
<br />
<br />                           ......To be continued.
<br />

			<div class="content">Hi again!
<br />
<br />Good idea Vader! I had just sent your fan fiction to Dreyus, os tha he maybe already knew it, but now everyone can read it and maybe they'll realize how good it is and bring it on the site. So, how does it go with the next chapter? When will it be out? (I know, I should be able to wait, as I'm always very slow with my work <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Now again to Dreyus (I think we will never end these long posts, but it doesn't matter):
<br />
<br />6. For now the Order is just defending, but I think that I will add some new story elements for them. As I'm not yet sure about what exactly this would be and as I want to surprise you a bit I will not say anything else about this.
<br />
<br />7. I agree with you that the Nomad Laser needs to few energy. I will increase this, so that normally a player would use energy weapons and missiles against non-capships.
<br />For stopping a player to get an ultimate loadout. At first I have to say that I already tried to do something like this with hardpoint limitations (actually a very good method), but I failed. As the FL engine does not allow to create new hardpoint classes (e.g.: Weapon class 11) I simply had not enough different classes and this solution is therefore not possible (The best modders here on TLR all said that creating new classes is not possible. Therefore and also after I tried many things I was convinced that this is true).
<br />But I think that my idea with different powerplants, etc. is quite useful. You would not even have enough energy to kill the enemy in the first strike. But then during the time your powerplant needs to reload the enemies shield would also reload and maybe he would even use bots or bats. So, this would be a possibility to stop someone with a fast ship to use the best weapons without limitations.
<br />In my opinion I can do this and I already did some tests on it. So this should work.
<br />
<br />For the hull not going down. I will have a look at this and then I can see what I can do. Normally every weapon in FL does hull damage, which is two times the shield damage (1000 hull damage = 500 shield damage). Only Pulse weapons are different. I will se, if I need to increase the hull damage or maybe also decrease the amount of Nanobots the NPCs carry.
<br />You are totally right with your suggestion about the NPCs using Nanobots. If you want to make the NPCs use Nanobots and Shieldbatteries, you can only do this in one way. The NPCs will use the Bots and Bats everytime their shield/hull reaches a specific percent of damage. Therefore, if a NPC gets attacked and the shield is already down, you will see the hull go down until it reaches some point. Then it will shortly go up (he uses bots) goes down to this point again and up again and so on until he has no bots anymore. If now multiple ships attack the NPC, this is happening so fast that it seems, as if the hull would not go down for a short time. The same thing is happening with the shield.
<br />But again this was only to explain you how it worrks. I will have a look, if I need to improve the hull damage thingy.
<br />
<br />I think you missunderstood a bit (or I did <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I said that during the storyline due to fixed level restrictions you are not able to fly a Sabre or Titan.
<br />And then I said that after the storyline is completed you could bnuy a Sabre or Titan. But then you should already be able to survive at least for a short time in the new systems (Nomad 1, Robot 1, etc.). Therefore the Nomad capships must not be too strong, as also Titan or Sabre pilots should be able to stand against them for a short time and with some help of the Monkeys/Robots. This should be possible for the average FL player (not a newbie, but also not a professional).
<br />
<br />I already thought about improving the cruisedisruptor usage. I will outfit more NPCs with CDs and I will also increase the rate they use these. So, it would not be so easy to escape, but still possible.
<br />
<br />You really suggest a total revamp, but I like your ideas and would even try to add them. There are only two things to remember. First I got my own ideas and sometimes I like them more than yours. Second I'm not a master modder and some things I just cannot do (some of these even a master modder might not be able to do).
<br />So, I try to do my best, but I have to stick to things that are possible to do and I will also put my ideas in my mod all the time, even if I try to add also the ideas of other players like you.
<br />
<br />So thanks again for all these good suggestions and please go on, if you got others!
<br />
<br />That's it for now.</div>

			<div class="content">Okay, I gotta apoligize, I was getting really out of line, your mod description says specifically that your not messing with the story. And Thanks for emaiing Vader's fan fiction.
<br />
<br />Just a few random ideas.
<br />For hardpoint limitation, couldn't you limit certain class weapons to torpedo and cruise disruptor postions? (Ex. Nomad missile idea in cruise dsiruptor and hull destroyer in torpedo spot to prevent abuse?) 
<br />
<br />Your right about the hull not going down, they just keep forking out nanobots, it DOES go down minutely, but goes right back up --_--, but only at 1/3rd hull strength. Unusually enough though, that only happens when fighting in the new systems. I tried fighting bounty hunters and their hull increased right when I shot them and I clearly saw the bar going up and down until they ran out of nanobots and then its like shooting down a regular ship<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Forget the total revamp idea lol, maybe just beef the Nomad battleship a bit, since you only encounter a few in SP anyways. A special note to make woud be that the new Nomad faction is neutral/friendly towards you at first, even during SP. Dunno if it's suppposed to be like that. Also how do you go about getting the Nomads to like you? it says there enemies of everyone, but does only killing Robots and Monkeys (possibly the Order) raise your reputation with them? It seems killing regular colony folk doesn't work.
<br />
<br />Last little thought occured to me, will you be remaking the storyline areas, like Omicron Minor (Toledo) and Omicron Major (The Nomad Lair, or if your amibtious the Dysons Sphere)?
<br />
<br />And one tiny bug (I think, not terribly sure if it was in the original too). Storyline only bases, like Benford Station in New York and Station Glorious in Dublin and even the Osiris in Omicron Minor don't have name tags. They appear on radar properly but the highlighting box shows them as &quot;%System Name%, %Sector Location% or Dublin System, Sector 6D or something like that.
<br />
<br />King Lin, this might help?  (check the last post)

<br />
<br />Edit - Spelling, found another bug *possibly*, the nomad torpedo and cruise disruptor lack material_library lines under [Gun in weapons_equipt.ini
<br />
<br />Another random thought - Is it posible to have a lingering explosion? A Nomad torpedo does massive amounts of damage but will never ever kill in one hit (even a Bloodhound --_--) because it will only take of their shields (combined with constant use of shield batters they can survive SEVERAL torpedoes). That doesn't seem right, so if the explosion can hang around long enoug hto deal two hits its should be able to kill a ship will a single powerful blow. 
<br />
<br />Another thought us for nanobots and shield batteries to use up energy. It's a bit a stretch but would certainly limit when and how'd you use them. Just an idea.

<br />                     Hi this is Vader{MERCS}, i just wanted to say the v1.18 patched installment is working cool so far, i have just been navigating around Rheinland Territory and am now on my way to meet JUNI on Planet Cambridge( i dont use complete NAV map so it is necessary that i fill up the Nav map with co-ordinates )I will keep you updated on my progress as to see if there are any bugs but i doubt there will be any.I also took on some Rheinland cruisers cause they opened fire on me and man, they can rumble!!( i had to high-tail it out of there and keep moving , FAST!!. I was also trying to save some of the escape-capsules he had in the cargo-hold and wanted to trade the Captain at a Bunschul or Red-Hessian base or something )  
<br />
<br />I love this Mod,Vader{MERCS}</div>

			<div class="content">Hey Vader, if your looking to get lots of coordinates, open yoru Nav Map hit Patrol Paths (the circular looking one, third one I think), it'll show you all neutral, friendly and enemy patrol paths, very useful<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> easiest way to find jumpholes and bases as thats where usually the patrol lines converge. The cruisers are beast at first, but grab a torpedo (or a heck load of patience) and life will be that much easier. Try moving in and infinity pattern, (sort of an 8 sideways i suppose, is the best way to describe it,) it throws off a lot of enemy fire, esspecially in light fighters because the turning angle is so extreme. Keep in mind the firing system auto detects where you shoot shoot *ahead* of time to make the shot connect, so you can take advantage of that. Wait til you get get to the new systems, it's an impressive piece of work. If you haven't invested in teh Light Armour Upgrade yet, I would suggest it, as it's the only one availible during the campaign due to level restrictions. Good luck and have fun. Pure credit to Black Eagle for this<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />              Hi this is Vader{MERCS}, hi dude, thanks for the advice , at the time my reputation with the Bounty-Hunters was still in the red and they are usually known to frequent area's such as unchartered jump-holes and such(I always use my Nav map to make sure any Minable zones are not too far away from friendly or neutral known Flight paths , cause i hate running into Enemies in Bad-ass ships when im in something crappy heh heh).It was only when i got sort of halfway through a system (Rheinland), then everyone would turn on me( at that time in the storyline i think you are enemies with the Rheinland Military.)
<br />
<br />  It would be cool if we could take out some Cruisers at the same time , same game lol,Vader{MERCS}</div>

<br />What's the exact error that your getting Lin? 
<br />
<br />And Vader, try bribeing the Bouny Hunters then killing enough of the little brats so everyoens neutral to you (esspecially Outcasts AND Corsairs) but don't kill enough to get them in the Enemy Status either. That way you can free roam in the Border Worlds, although its a lot of work. Of course you could always high tail it from the Bounty Hunters by using like 5 counter measure everytime you exit and see them there. Trust me it's not hard, just frustrating at times, cause you might have to keep trying if a cruise disruptor gets through.
