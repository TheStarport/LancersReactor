People sue the government all the time for not telling them something is bad for them Like exsmokers who sue because the got cancer, or Obease people who sue because the MickyD's made them fat. It's all about responcibility. Be informed of what you do, eat, see, that way you can decide what will harm you and avoide it. If I was stupid enough to carry a piece of uranium around in my pocket and not know what it would do to me, I would be responcible, not the guy who sold it to me. *shakes Head*</div>

			<div class="content">If you eat sugar in its natural forms, fruit juce, honey, berrys, ect it is not as bad for you, but in the white refined form it is deadly. It has been proven in the US, that the refined sugar has increased dental damage in people, as well as increasing the obesity as well. If you have a higher motabilizem, you might be able to handle it a little, but there is another side effect as well. Diabetes. The higher intake can lead to this which then requires the elimination of sugar and possible the daily shots to stabilize the blood sugar. I love sweets, but to a point, too much makes me sick to my stomach. But, I can eat all the sweet apples I want. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">but there's always something isn't there, some staple food that we're told is bad for you, cos some scientists fed 10 tons of it to a lab rat and it got ill and died. if we believed everything &quot;scientists&quot; and &quot;the authorities&quot; told us was bad (or good) we'd end up with nothing. all and every food is ok, in moderation. simple common sense is enough. if people are so stupid they can't see that, well they deserve everything that's coming to them imo. Do I moan about my bad heart? no, cos it's (partly) my own fault and I don't burden the State or anyone else with it, except myself.

			<div class="content">The facts about nutrition and proper dieting is not taught to many, perhaps even most children as they grow up.  Not the science of it anyway.  Not by the parents and not by the schools.  Schools even have contracted with McDonalds to provide food services, for example.  Into this void, the commercial interests have poured millions in advertising and marketing research to maximize on demand and sales.
<br />
<br />What results?  The more sugar the more likely something will sell.  That's the their mantra and our collective problem.  Carbonated soft drinks, the non-diet kind, have more sugar in them than two bars of Hershey's cholocate.
<br />
<br />Kiddie breakfast cereals have as much sugar in a standard serving as, again, a bar of Hershey's cholocate.
<br />
<br />Demand for super sweet foods is stoked by advertising, advertising gimmicks (free games or special prizes inside, favorite cartoon and move characters on the wrapping, etc.
<br />
<br />As Chips already said, sugar can be the source of obesity as it is the ultimate carbohydrate.</div>

<br />
<br />There it is sycho - ignoring hunger won't lose weight - nope, restricting the amount of food (fatty or non fatty doesn't matter...protein rich food won't make you fat as its hard to digest, nor will fibre rich food in general - but high carbs/fats will!) to roughly equal the amount of energy their body <b>needs </b> is what dieting is all about. To lose weight they need to eat less energy than their body needs to have, however, as soon as those hunger pangs start...they give in.
<br />
<br />They more a person eats, the more hungry they get. Stuff your face full every day several times a day, and within a short while you will find that how you used to eat doesn't satisfy you anymore. You need more food than you did. Eating less will make you feel like your starving. Apart from in medical cases, fat people eat more than they need to fit their lifestyle. Simple fact. 
<br />
<br />
<br />As for the excercise - the government have had incentives and schemes for people to use/join in order to do more excercise. You tell me they have no right to say there is too much sugar in some foods and that it will have to be reduced, but they SHOULD make everyone do excercise like boot camp? Problem is that fat people don't want to do excercise, but will moan that they are fat and its not their fault!!!. Diets don't work - what they mean is &quot;I was hungry so i ate too much&quot; or &quot;its been one week, and i haven't lost more than a pound&quot;. Diets do work - but rather than having the discipline to stick to the diets, many would prefer to have their stomach stapled.....which the government has to pay for (or the tax payer). 
<br />
<br />The reason it all came about is because they found the Kellogs Frosties had nearly 30g of sugar on every 100g of cereal. It was something hugely excessive, and very ridiculous. Your telling me that the government shouldn't say &quot;whoah there - that is TOO much sugar content. Lower it!!&quot; After all - they aren't saying we cannot eat sugar, they are saying we should WATCH how much we eat, and that certain manufactures should lower the amount of sugar in their foodstuffs - as its too high and very un-necessary.
<br />
<br />
<br />However, I am English, and just like their &quot;salt&quot; bit, you will still be able to go to the supermarket and buy bags of sugar, pots of salt and what not. Its not like you get a weekly license for salt and sugar in the UK - which is scanned at supermarkets......they are merely saying some food manufactures include far far too much of these ingredients to which there is no regulation.  Since the water you drink has to be a certain quality, the education you receive has to be a certain quality, the vehicles you drive have to be a certain quality..........isn't it okay to say the food you eat should be of a certain quality as well??
<br />
<br />The media play anything up to make it sound horrific.......truth is that NO ONE is going to notice this at all. The difference is that parents won't have to check if their bottle or ribena contains 30% sugar in it, which rots their babies teeth - as it should contain under a certain amount.
<br />
<br />So is it really overbearing government - or shewd action to head off a further degradation of public health?? You can make up your own mind, but for me I do not see this as government dicating what is best - but trying to prevent a 4 billion pounds a year health bill.....and increasing the standard of living for the potential porkies.</div>

			<div class="content">@Chips, oh I understood wrong, when you said hunger pains, I thought you meant people starving themselves to lose weight.
<br />Diets doesnt workd really, why do I say this? A diet is basically that you controll your eating habits, but usually people only go on diets for a certain time, which means after the diet they pick up weight again, so the only effective diet is a life long diet. 
<br />No they cannot force people to exercise, I was simply saying that it would be better to promote exercise than to let them eat less sugar
<br />And eating more doesnt always make youfat, it can me ke you lose weight as well.
<br />If people just lived responsibly it wouldn't be necesarry for making rules in anyway. eating less sugar ghmf</div>

			<div class="content">hehe - life long diet - like i said, if they only ate what the body needed, then they would not have any weight problems at all. Is that a diet? Or is that not overindulging themselves due to greed.
<br />
<br />I love reading about diets, they diet to lose weight, hit their target, and usually eat crisps, chocolate, pastries, biscuits, chips, pies etc etc. Then they say they get fat again. They then diet again, before re-piggin out. Its a vicious circle that can be avoided by.............eating sensibly. There are some with genuine medical conditions, but there are far too many who just don't possess the qualities necessary to moderate what they want with what is good for them.
<br />
<br />Basically a diet is a personality change - changing the persons willpower/self indulgence and more. If they succeed - its not a lifelong diet - its a one off change to a healthy life. They just have to deny themselves excess fatty foods....after a while - its not a denile - but something they no longer desire.
<br />
<br />
<br />By the way - no, I don't have any weight problems - i am as thin as a stick, and can eat anything/everything they want. My sister however, had to do a change due to being fat. She no longer eats crisps, biscuits, chocolates etc....and no longer diets either. She is now a perfect figure without any futher effort required <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />healthy lifestyle, you could call it a diet, but I think the problem also comes in with the difference between people, the one does not want to sit and watch while the other eat away on nice stuff.
<br />and then you can also add that some people eat to make them feel better emotionally
<br />and some are just plain idiots</div>
