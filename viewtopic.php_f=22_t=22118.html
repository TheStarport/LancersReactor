<br />If you create a character on this server, be advised to follow the admin's stated rules to the LETTER, (pun intended) or you will be sorely reminded of those rules in due time.

			<div class="content">Hello, what intellectual property am I storing on my server?  As far as I know I am just running Microsoft IP on the server (the game engine Freelancer)
<br />
<br />Names of characters are not IP.  If you believe your name to be IP, I will delete it ASAP if you tell me it as I do not wish to have that on my server for possible risks associated.
<br />
<br />As for your other statements, yes, if you do not have the time to read the Server news (which you are told to do priotr to recieving the password to logon) then well, I will delete your character name if it is in violation of the naming rules.
<br />
<br />It is my right to setup the server and run it as I wish.  I have 2 little rules that most people have chosen to abide by with no problem.  Name Rules and cheating/modding.  Very simple.  If you can't follow those then I am sure the other 2500 accounts on my server would gladdly take your place in the logged in roster.
<br />
<br />While you may see a fair amount of posts complaigning, you will also note that the most vocal are usually people whining about the rules (and their lack of ability to follow them)  Take Obsidian above.  Had he just followed the name rule he wouldn't be in this mess in the first place.
<br />
<br />What most of you don't see is the dozens of mails I get a week that thank me for running such a stable and fast server.  That thank me for doing my part for the Freelnacer community.
<br />
<br />Obsidian, why don't you do your part for the Freelancer community, and rather than consistantly bashing the Admins that take the time, money, and patiance to run the servers.  Either Start your own server, or play on one that does not have rules that you have to worry about reading, or don't agree with.
<br />
<br />How many servers out there only let their clans play on them?  How many only let members of their country play?  How many are passworded so only certain people can play?  At least mine is open to anyone that can and will follow a couple of simple rules.

			<h3><a href="#p181942" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Firstly: Please spell my name correctly; you've already deleted the 24/7-Seattle-Based-compliant version of its spelling, so you should already be one-up without having to even look how it is spelled above.
<br />
<br />Secondly: &quot;An intellectual property is any product of the human intellect that is unique, novel, and unobvious (and has some value in the marketplace).&quot;  as according to the University of Texas at Arlington's Office of Technology Transfer. Yes, you have intellectual property stored on your server.
<br />
<br />Thirdly: It was not my intent to discredit your service to the Freelancer community with this thread, but to make certain that those who use your server are VERY aware of your rules, and more importantly your totalitarian attitude, as displayed above, etc. BEFORE you delete their account because their name did not fit your guidelines. Your rules, as stated (and for the FOURTH TIME, yes I read them THROROUGHLY before playing and made EVERY attempt to abide by them; let's not personalize this too much, please) have some definate areas that are open to interpretation.
<br /><img src='http://www.kl-5.net/vr6/screen2.jpg            '>
<br />It should simply be stated that &quot;NO NUMBERS are allowed in the names of this server except to designate rank.&quot; Period.
<br />
<br />Lastly: I do indeed have my own server, however my naming convention does not allow for letters, unfortunately; you'd be disappointed. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />Seriously, I do, however I am using many changing mods with a limited number of ppl, and it is therefore passworded to limit the amount of headache that would insue for ALL if I opened it up... versions, unauthorized mods, etc. But that is not what is at hand here..
<br />
<br />Your server is the ONLY server I have <b>ever          </b> taken issue with, for the record, publically or no: the only one. You and I might have had a nice and friendly email exchange that I courteously initiated, but we have now come to public forum. I am not brining to issue other servers in the community; I am not brining to issue anything other than this warning to the community about your server and to make even <b>clearer, your own rules.
<br />   </b>
<br />Consider this a service to you and do not presume to personally demean me, or any other that brings grievances to light in good faith.
<br />
<br />Fly friendly.

			<div class="content">Why is it so hard to understand why I posted this, Admiral..
<br />
<br />I DID READ the rules and went by what they said - that is my freaking POINT, man. My name on the server was spelled &quot;0bsideo&quot;, and it was deleted. Can you tell me why? It was deleted along with the hours and cooperative play I'd put into it - that's my only beef and I'm not trying to flame the server or it's admin except to say that if the rules aren't put down more clearly then this will happen to others - I'm simply trying to prevent that.
<br />
<br />&quot;NO NUMBERS are allowed in the names this server&quot; is a more apt way to put it.
<br />
<br />Nice to meet you, btw, Admiral; I don't have choice names to call you at this time.

			<div class="content">But I do Allow #'s in names.  There are many a player on my server that can attest to this (even outside of Ranks)
<br />
<br />Just mainly not #'s that replace letters.  Pretty Straight forward if you read the rules with that one.
<br />
<br />Also, as with all internet servers that you don't pay for, it is up to the Admin to set his own rules and to walk whatever side of the line they want to to judge if names or other points of interest fall within their rules.
<br />
<br />Being that not a single FL Admin with a top server that I know of runs this as their full time job (We have to pay for the DSL/T1 lines, COmputers, ect.. somehow), it should be understandable that occassionally we have to make calls at the spur of the moment.  We can sit there and go, lets think about this for an hour.  Lets try to try to contact ever person that can't read the rules and make sure they understand them.
<br />
<br />Also, a hidden point of my rules seems to have worked quite well in this case.
<br />
<br />If you can't spend time to read a simple rule like a name rule before creating your name, will you really be a valuble member of the server community, or more of a distruption.  On the Other hand, say you did read the rule (like you) and intentially went out of your way to find a loophole or circumvent said rule, what is to say you won't also try to do so when playing on the server when it comes to mods/cheats or other rules?

			<div class="content">I went &quot;out of my way to circumvent or find a loophole&quot;? What?? Are you serious? I was &quot;PLAYING&quot;, friend, NOT trying to bring down your precious rules; I chose a name that looked compliant and left it at that and launched to space. Give me a break.
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Just mainly not #'s that replace letters. Pretty Straight forward if you read the rules with that one. </i>
<br />
<br />Great! Say THAT! Just leave out &quot;mainly&quot;... are there still mainly some folks who mostly don't have numbers in their name? This is what I'm getting at - I did not mean to break your rule and think I was wronged because of it. I don't use cheats so it takes awhile to build up a character, ya know?
<br />
<br />Genedefect, you are not hearing anything I've said and you do not know me whatsoever; I have tried to be as polite as possible in this whole matter from the very begining - read my original requests for help and email to you. I am not a modder/cheater/etc, in fact I was looking for a server relatively free from that crap... but you say that &quot;a hidden point of my rules seems to have worked quite well in this case.&quot; That's beautiful- just lovely; quite the reverse is the case, actually, friend.
<br />Now you are just coming across as smug/snide/&amp;unreasonble, 
<br />so I suppose MY super-secret hidden point in posting this thread is shining through in spades as well. Whatever.
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks for all your help, time, and good nature. 
<br />Just plain nevermind - enjoy your kingdom, King.

			<div class="content">I would say that since the players and admins both are what make up this community (and again I do run my own - tho certainly not of this magnitude) then either should be able to voice a greviance without fear of repproach. I am NOT complaining about Genedefect's stance as an admin and right to set up whatever rules he chooses - I am ONLY stating that the rules are not entirely clear (as many posts on this forum can attest to); make them clearer (I would happily write out these for you, GD, and submit them for your approval) and this kind of thing will happen much less frequently.
<br />
<br />Both of your points are taken, Stinger, Falcon, and well. 
<br />Again, I was trying to be respectful, though maybe not completely successfully, in the face of entire disrespect, being called things that I am not, being told I believe in ways I DO not, and behave in ways I shall not; all because a set of misspelled server rules we're not clear enough to point out that I couldn't have a zero in my name and I took issue. lol
<br />
<br />I'll not be replying to this thread any longer as I've said my peace. They say respect begets respect and courteousy - courteousy.. I'm always hoping that is the case. To any I've offended, my apologies; was not my intent.

<br />0bSiDe0,
<br /> I'm sure you have many silent people that support your side.  When an admin screws you over, you have the right to voice your greavance.  I think you also have the right to warn others that may fall into the same trap.

			<div class="content">The server statistics that I am referring to are the ones that you posted on the forum yourself.  You have announced the number of active/banned accounts etc. in another thread.  The one that I remember is 4500 active and 600 banned.  That is a 1/8.5 banned/active ratio.
<br />
<br />He was trying to comply with your rules.  If you look at his screen shot of your rules and keep an open mind, you can see how he might have thought that he could put a 0 instead of an O in his name.  Your examples are bad names and definately violate your rule, but his name looks nothing like a collection of numbers that would be &quot;annoying&quot; as you put it in another thread.  It was obviously an unintentional violation and a communication mistake.  Give him the benefit of the doubt.  He had good intentions.
<br />
<br />The reason that I speak up about this stuff is my nature to fight for the under-dog.  I also hate it when others unnecessarily screw up others.  He was creating his toy on your toy server.  You didn't like his name, so you destroyed his toy all together.  
<br />
<br />I think he is doing a good thing by warning others.  Players should be very careful about your rules and advertising this keeps others from suffering consequences that they do not see coming.
<br />

<br />
<br />PS  It is difficult to see from your point of view, as it is difficult for you to see from the players point of view.  I think we should have some respect for eachothers opinions.</div>
