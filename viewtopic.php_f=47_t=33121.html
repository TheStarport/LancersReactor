			<div class="content">Well, encouraged by the brilliant fan fiction writers on this forum such as Neuromancer and killa, I intend on writing one myself. =) Here goes.
<br />
<br />                                                    *******
<br />&quot;Liberty Heavy Fighter Wing, please submit your data and registration.&quot;
<br />&quot;Roger that LPI Patrol Wing Theta 9, this is LSF Wing Gamma 6 on a special priority mission. We're inbound for the Battleship Wake along the Manhattan - Fort Bush trade lane.&quot;
<br />&quot;Roger that, Gamma 6. Good to have you back.&quot;
<br />&quot;Affirmative.&quot;
<br />
<br />As soon as the transmission exchanged ended, Major Michael King of the LSF and his friend and temporary wingman Edison Trent engaged trade lane to the Norfolk Shipyards. Trent had now taken on a short term contract with the LSF recently due to a recent explosion of criminal activity in the Liberty systems. However, before he had taken on the job, Trent had been deeply involved in Bounty Hunting. More specifically, he had set up camp on Freeport 9 in Omicron Theta so that he could hunt Corsairs for cash. It had, obviously, been very fruititious for the Freelancer, who, being a good flier and having a very well equipped ship, managed to significantly hamper Corsair development near their own homeworld. He had already made more than $30,000,000, and since he had grown incredibly bored of chasing Corsairs who were more often flying, armored Turkeys, he decided to assist in the crime problem in Liberty. Of course, this was only partially the reason, for his old friends Michael King and Jun'ko Zane had pleaded him to come. Trent, feeling an obligation to help them, and also the fact that he could probably juice a few new government contacts out of the deal, decided to go and assist.
<br />
<br />And now, Trent was assisting Michael King to a newly stationed Liberty Dreadnought in the New York system to drop off an interesting, mysterious artifact that they had confiscated from a prominent illegal Artifacts dealer in Rheinland. It was a fairly boring mission, the only action being when they were involved in a fight with Unioners who's territory they had accidentally crossed.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, Trent. What have you been upto lately ?&quot; asked King.
<br />Trent said, &quot;Well, it's been a pretty boring few years for me. What with the fighting vicious pirates, selling countless Alien artifacts and reaping in millions of credits, it's become a pretty much endless process.&quot;
<br />&quot;Hehe. Only YOU would find that boring, Trent.&quot; 
<br />&quot;Only I, King. You wouldn't stand a chance out in the Edge Worlds anyways.&quot;
<br />&quot;Hmm ? What are you talkin' about ?&quot; retorted King.
<br />&quot;Well, I'm not the one who nearly got his left wing blown off by a Junker scrapper in Rheinland space.&quot; said Trent, grinning.
<br />&quot;Hey, hey, I didn't even know he was gonna shoot at me.&quot; responded King.
<br />&quot;Yeah. Riiiiiight.&quot; Trent said, turning off his intercom. King could get real sensitive when it came to his fighting skills.
<br />
<br />Trent and King eventually landed on the LNS Wake, the latest addition to the Liberty crime fighting forces. It was stationed along the Manhattan - Fort Bush trade lane to interdict the increasingly powerful Xeno presence in the area. A few years ago, the Xenos managed to scrape up a victory against the Junkers, resulting in the Junkers being expelled from the Jersey. However, they had moved over to the Detroit field and have ever since skirmished with Xenos along the Jersey Lane. 
<br />
<br />&quot;King, Trent. Good to see you two again.&quot; shouted Juni from across the docking bay. 
<br />&quot;Juni, hi. Long time.&quot; said Trent, grinning. Juni and him had had a fling after the Nomad War and it was obvious that he still enjoyed the memory. The memory also disgusted Juni, and that was partially the reason Trent enjoyed throwing it in her face.
<br />&quot;Trent, get over it. We're professionals now, we have to act as such.&quot;
<br />&quot;Professional whats ?&quot; asked King, looking over at Juni and laughing.
<br />&quot;Haha, very funny guys. Let's get back to work now.&quot; responded Juni coldly.&quot;What of this artifact that you got, how did you get it ?&quot; 
<br />King replied, &quot;You see Juni, it's all about interaction. In this case, the muzzle of Trent's gun to the dealer's head.&quot; then he broke out laughing.
<br />&quot;Idiots.&quot; muttered Juni. &quot;Come on, let's go to the briefing room, Admiral Belzair has an assignment for us.&quot;
<br />&quot;Already ?! I was hoping for some R &amp; R before the next mission...&quot; Moaned Trent.
<br />&quot;Well, sorry Trent, but we have a real job to do. now come on.&quot; replied Juni.
<br />Under armed guard, Juni, Trent, and King walked to briefing room on Level 2 of the battleship. An LSF Science team had already taken charge of the artifact in Trent's hold and had proceeded to another side of the docking bay to send it to the science lab.
<br />
<br />Trent, Juni, and King finally arrived at the debriefing room.
<br />&quot;Okay, Trent, Admiral Belzair isn't someone to mess around with, so act as respectful as you can.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; responded Trent, obviously unconcerned with what was going on.
<br />I wonder why I put up with him, thought Juni. Whatever, she thought, he'd get beaten back into line by Belzair. 
<br />
<br />The trio walked into the room, sat down, and waited for Admiral Belzair.
