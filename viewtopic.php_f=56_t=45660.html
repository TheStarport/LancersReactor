<br />Welcome to Asgard v.4 - now try to survive. 
<br />Asgard RPG Mod is an additive change to the basic Freelancer game, designed to enhance role play. There have been few changes to the existing systems or bases, AI, or commodities. Other than the light which you will miss immediately, most things you know about Freelancer are still true - but with MANY additions. 
<br />* 161 amazing and original ships, many never before seen in a Freelancer mod and created exclusively for Asgard. Including 16 custom Capital ships you can fly. 
<br />
<br />*Four new systems have been discovered. The Plain of Idavoll is located in the middle of Asgard, and has long been used as an important meeting place. Uppsala near New York is ruled by peace and is a No PvP system featuring the beautiful new &quot;Asgard Hangout.&quot; Obeah is the new home of Synth Foods, and Alborg - well, you would do better to just not go there. 
<br />
<br />* Some previously deteriorating bases and tradelanes have been replaced with new models, adding a fresh new feel to many systems. When was the last time you docked on a base you had never seen the model for? 
<br />
<br />* Twenty special Faction Ships buyable in-game only by the sponsoring faction - a concept first introduced at Asgard. 
<br />
<br />* Personal duels can now be settled at Rattvik - a PvP zone specifically designed to give you NPC free areas, and your choice of clear, asteroid, or badland zones to fight in. After the fight have your fallen opponent buy you the &quot;Trophy of Honor&quot; from the attractive ladies that run the base. 
<br />
<br />* Quest to acquire and assemble the finest weapon ever to been seen in Asgard, &quot;The Hope of the Alliance&quot;. Now extended with the advanced &quot;Joy of the Alliance&quot; and the sophisticated Nomad Power Plant. A new concept for FL first introduced here. 
<br />
<br />* More than 115 new contraband and legal commodities. Including 58 &quot;Top Secret&quot; commodities whose sole purpose is role play. Asgard is a traders paradise. 
<br />
<br />* Several dozen new guns, missiles, thrusters, tractor beams, mines, even armor upgrades available for purchase 
<br />
<br />* Real World Stock Market tied to Asgard factions, both player and NPC. Make money in your sleep! 
<br />
<br />* 34 custom wrecks, each with outstanding weapons waiting to be looted 
<br />
<br />* 35 new bases have been opened; some existing ones now offer more services 
<br />
<br />* Tohoku has been opened up to general travel, and all bases were re-colonized. 
<br />
<br />* Suns burn with a dim glow, or have burned out all together 
<br />
<br />* Now featuring upgradeable power plants on every ship 
<br />
<br />* Incorporates &quot;Extended Key-Set (EKS)&quot; for advanced maneuvering controls (full directions included below) 
<br />
<br />* Diplomat, Cadet, Businessmen, and Humanitarian Aid Workers now available as passengers 
<br />
<br />* Every jumphole is open 
<br />
<br />* Cruise speed increased to 500 
<br />
<br />* The hot &quot;Trade Lane Disrupter&quot; is available 
<br />
<br />* Higher level missions available in all systems. Missions are now more challenging, against custom ships, with much better pay and drops. 
<br />
<br />* Player looting of cargo and ammo (dieing has consequences) 
<br />
<br />* PvP allowed in New York so long as player is above Level 20 
<br />
<br />* More profitable mining experience in 30+ of the richest fields, several new fields now in place including a new concept - dynamic asteroids that can pay huge rewards if you &quot;catch&quot; them. 
<br />
<br />* Unique science exploration and mining ships for better role play 
<br />
<br />* A few of the long abandoned tradelane and jump gate construction projects have been completed. Others have been started. Some have broken. 
<br />
<br />* Increased nomad encounters 
<br />
<br />*Don'Kavosh an NPC faction and a major force to be reckoned with 
<br />
<br />*We are now gender integrated, with women filling many of the sales and repair positions around Asgard 
<br />
<br />* New start ship and location 
<br />
<br />* Begin with a little more money in your pocket, but not enough to matter 
<br />
<br />* many many other surprises to discover out there 
<br />
<br />* Now includes the Unofficial FL SP 1.4 by Buck Danny. No need to pre-install the SDK 1.3 as it is included in this mod.
<br />
<br />++++kudos and credits+++++ 
<br />Thanks go to the dozens and dozens of you who played Asgard and made creative, original suggestions on things to incorporate or ideas to evolve. I hope you are pleased with the outcome, and can spot your ideas all over the place in v.4. 
<br />
<br />The work you are about to enjoy would not have come to fruition without the support, brainstorming, and outstanding code work of the &quot;devGuy Mod Team&quot;: DocFuglyMark, Spook, Samurai, Ogu, Enigma, Snake Eye, Battlestar, and Don'Movet Schwarz. These talented and dedicated folks have spent more time and creative energy in producing Asgard v.4 than I dreamed anyone would be willing to invest. The result of their significant contributions is a Freelancer mod more tailored to player needs, and more focused on the creation of an outstanding role play environment than I have ever seen before. A deep heartfelt thank you to each and every one on the team. 
<br />
<br />Asgard is fortunate to have amazing ships to fly, many never seen in Freelancer before Asgard v.4. Hobbes from Samurai Studios (aka Roland Dynamics Corp), Korg from Allied Exports Shipyards, as well as DocFuglyMark of DFMEngineering joined the Asgard team and created most of the fantastic unique ships you will fly here. In addition, the following ships were contributed by other designers, many a part of the Asgard community themselves:
<br />Arwing, Ragnarok - Ryuujin 
<br />Champion, Sylph - Caid 
<br />Ekos, Icos - Paul from virtualsolarsystem 
<br />Dhole, Jackal, Pariah - Astral Prime Studios 
<br />Predator - ColdFusion 
<br />Scouser - Achilles 
<br />ViciousStrike, Proteus, Dark Angel - Xtreme Team Studios 
<br />Waran - RimShot 
<br />Cytran - Buck Rogers 
<br />Cruental - Mogadin 
<br />Firebird - DDR and Son 
<br />Anshawn, Derringer, Silverfish, Blockade Runner - Skystalker 
<br />Blade - SE Shipyards 
<br />Mighty Flea, Might of Will, Valor - Bad Karma 
<br />Bounty Hunter - Porsche 
<br />Eliminator - AluminumHaste/Argh/Versoth 
<br />FireFly - Godzero 
<br />Goliath, Albatross, Ballista, Danrik, Excelcia, Spartan, - ll Fulmine Nero 
<br />H-Fuel Express - FIND 
<br />Neorex - xXx and Gibbon 
<br />Serafina - Yedan and Asmo 
<br />Prometheus - Mephistopheles 
<br />Enforcer - Spaz 
<br />Firbolg - awts0c 
<br />Singularity - Lancer 
<br />Vanquish - Enigma, Barbosa, BlackBeard and Jar Jar
<br />Thanks to all of them for sharing such incredible talent with us, and for granting permission for their work to be included in this mod. 
<br />
<br />Our outstanding startup screen and forum graphics are from Enigma - one of the best pixel pushers I've had the pleasure to call friend. 
<br />
<br />Extended Key-Set (EKS), a very clever creation of Aegir, was included with his permission. 
<br />
<br />Buck Danny built the Unofficial Freelancer v1.4 Patch which has been fully integrated into this release (yes you can now get the Paralyzer Missile Launcher). 
<br />
<br />Thanks to Louva-Deus for letting me use and edit his RealSpace code. 
<br />
<br />Battleship wrecks based on the Battleship Wreck Mod by Xtreme Team Studios. 
<br />
<br />EMP mines based on original work by Silverfire. 
<br />
<br />Custom bases Solar Refinery, XTS Nova, and XTS Xbase are by XTS-ImperaTodd and the XTS-TheXtreme Team. Thanks to them for letting us use these brand new ideas. 
<br />
<br />Admiration to Jon
