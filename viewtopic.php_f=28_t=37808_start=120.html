			<div class="content">Hi Powerdoll!
<br />
<br />Good to see you! I'm not totally sure, if you can use your old svaes, as I changed some things with the equipment. But normally it should be okay. Just try it out. The worst thing to happen would be that FL crashes.
<br />
<br />One thing though: Monkey Universe is not a &quot;new&quot; version of the Monkeys. It is a stand-alone project for the SFG clan and their server. There are all the things from The Monkeys 1.18 and some things from the next version of the Monkeys in it, but also some additions, not going into the Monkeys (like the Starwars ships). The biggest difference is that Monkey Universe is made for MP. However this does not mean that it cannot be played in SP. But I can only say that you should try it in MP, as it might be even better than SP.
<br />
<br />The Monkeys instead is for both MP and SP, but I focussed firstly on SP and will do so in the future versions.
<br />
<br />It's good to hear that my idea of the wrecks worked. I had in mind exactly this situation. Someone is hostile with the Nomads and cannot get their strong equipment (mine, CD and Torpedo). Therefore I put the wrecks, which are very difficult to find and dangerous to loot, but are really worth it.
<br />In a new Order system I made for the next version (it is also in Monkey Universe) there is again such a wreck, which is difficult to find and very dangerous to loot, but will give you a very strong piece of equipment. I hope you like it!
<br />
<br />So, I hope you will like Monkey Universe. Thanks again for all the nice posts and good ideas and stay tuned for the next version of the actual Monkeys Mod!
<br />
<br />See you around!
<br />

			<div class="content">Thanks gestoord!
<br />
<br />I worked on the Monkey Universe Mod during the last weeks and am now finished. So, I can go on with the work on the Monkeys Mod now. I'm still working on a smaller patch to version 1.2 now. After this I will then go on with a bigger update to the next version.
<br />
<br />If you want to see some new things that are also in version 1.2 of the Monkeys, just download the Monkey Universe Mod and visit the server of the SFG. You will see two new systems, you will be able to do missions for the Nomads and some other things. The server is really good (lag-free) and the people are very helpful and you will find a really good RPG server for FL with the &quot;Monkey feeling&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So, try it out and stay tuned for the next version of the Monkeys!
<br />Thanks again for all the support I got in the forum and in this thread!

			<div class="content">Hi, Black Eagle.
<br />I've just explored the Monkey Universe for some while, and I was totally surprised.
<br />Several mission-only system have been unlocked. That&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s I was looking forward to. Although I have not found any dockable base because of the absence of nav map, I think it&#8217;s a great progress.
<br />I like your nomad city very much. The idea to add a docking ring to make it dockable is very clever. The great shield of the city is cool, wish I can have one on my ship<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I also like the starwar ships. Their structure and texture were beautiful, just like the ones in the movie. What&#8217;s more, some of them shared the same design style, which made them like a series of ships. I suggest that you keep these models in the next mod.
<br />Fighting is much easier now. The recover rate of NPC ships slow down and ships seem to give up more cargo when hit down. Finally I can earn some money by standard missions.
<br />OK, here are some advices, hope you can take them to make the Monkey 1.2 mod more perfect.
<br />First, the jump gates between the nomadia and the mission-only systems (such as Omicron Major), have no names. They just show up as &#8220;unknown object&#8221; both on universe and ship scanner. And when I got to Omicron Major I found several &#8220;unknown object&#8221; jump gates. Since the nav map was not available in that system, I was lost. I even did not know how to get back to nomadia. I noticed you set the bases in nomadia with very long and did not provide any highway lane (unlike the robot system). This design, together with some exploding gas or radiation area, would be enough to make the nomadia like other border worlds systems: mysterious and dangerous. I think there is no need to use unnamed jump gates to make the system more puzzling. 
<br />Second, the location of nomadia seemed to get the nav map a little messed up. The nomadia is in the west part of the Sirus, and several jump gates in nomadia lead to nomad1 and some other mission-only systems, which are in the east part of Sirus. As a result, several lines are drown across the whole Sirus, making the nav map all together illegible. It&#8217;s a good idea to connect the west part and east part of Sirus, but maybe you can set some sideways to avoid crossing the middle part of the traffic network.
<br />Another question is that some people in nomads bases are in the uniform of the order. That&#8217;s incredible! Maybe you have defined these people as order soldiers infected by nomads during the first nomads war? I didn&#8217;t read the text description very carefully, I just want to make sure this is not an ignored mistake.
<br />I&#8217;m using my monkey 1.18 save to continue game, so far it works well. You know I have just run this new mod for a short period of time. I even have not found the order system. I just can&#8217;t wait to tell you my exciting feeling about this mod. Great work Black Eagle! And I will continue the exploratory work.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Powerdoll!
<br />
<br />So you visited the Monkey Universe server. I will also be around during the next days and maybe we can meet.
<br />
<br />Now for your suggestions: At first I have to say that Monkey Universe has some additions and changes the Monkeys will not have and that it has some &quot;unfinished&quot; things that will be finished in the Monkeys (I just did the basics and not really detailed things, as I ran out of time).
<br />
<br />- The story only systems will also be unlocked in the next version of the Monkeys. But in Monkey Universe, I just unlocked them and left them as they are (empty, with no Navmap and with many unknown objects). In the Monkeys I will work on them and will add names and infos to everything, add some more bases and make them like real systems.
<br />- I have to say that the Nomadia system is not from me. Strail, the admin and creator of the Void mod (which is also based on the Monkeys) made it and I'm very grateful that I can use it also in the Monkeys. However I also made a Nomad system by myself in a similar style before and will now change it a bit, to have two new really Nomad-like systems.
<br />- I have to agree that the Starwars ships have really good and detailed models, but I will not include them in the Monkeys. I do not want ships from any other know space &quot;story&quot; in the mod, as I want to keep the FL feeling. However there will be many other new ships (also new classes like bombers), with models, which in my opinion really fit into FL (like the Discoverer, the Thoth and so on). I will add new ships in all the future versions. In 1.2 there will hopefully be four new ones and the old ones will be rebalanced.
<br />- Fighting is really easier on the Void, as I had to change the bot/bat usage due to MP problems with this. However in the Monkeys I do not want to change it so much. I will try to rebalance this also, but it will be a bit more challenging to fight than in Monkey Universe. Therefore I will increase the mission payout in the Monkeys 1.2, to make missions worth the work.
<br />- The higher amount of loot you get from NPCs is caused by the Player looting, I included in the Monkey Universe Mod. This will also not be in the Monkeys and you will not get so much loot. In my opinion it is too easy with this setting, but the player looting is only working this way. As we do not need player looting in the Monkeys (it is mainly SP), the loot will be similar to version 1.18.
<br />
<br />Now to your advices:
<br />- The bug with the jumpgates in the Nomadia systems not having names is quite strange. I did not test it on the server yet, but during the testing process in SP (shortly before the mod was released) they had names and info. So, this might be a problem on your comp. Maybe you can try to download the mod again and activate only Monkey Universe in FLMM after restoring backups.
<br />- Also the jumpgates back to Nomadia should be named. In the SP-only systems there might be some unknown objects (normally not the jumpgates, but just some weaponplatforms or Nomad buildings), but as I said this will be fixed in the Monkeys and normally it should only be objects you do not need to or cannot interact with.
<br />- I thought about adding tradelanes in Nomadia, but in my opinion tradelanes in a Nomad system were not very realistic. So I left them out.
<br />- The Navmap issue (linking the east and west part) is a good advice. I will try to find a workaround in the Monkeys. Thanks!
<br />- The Order people and all the people on Nomad bases are infected persons from every faction in the game. I thought this would show the new threat of the Nomads quite good.
<br />
<br />So, many thanks for all the suggestions. I hope you agree with me and if not, just post your thoughts. During the next three days I have to learn for some exams in school, but then I will be modding again and I hope to see you on the Monkey Universe server sometime.
<br />

			<div class="content">For those of you trying out the Monkey Universe 1.84 mod on the Monkey Universe:
<br />
<br />We as server admins have decided to make a change in the start up reputations.
<br />
<br />From now on all new characters start as hostile with the nomads !!!
<br />All other factions start as neutral as before.
<br />This makes more sense because the nomads are the enemies of the human race and civilisation.
<br />
<br />This reputation change makes the new systems and the unknowns very interesting and challenging to fly thru...
<br />
<br />So flying into the unknowns or the new systems with a starflyer has become a very life threatening experience <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />We suggest to get a better equipped and armed ship before entering these systems...

			<div class="content">Hi bulahaw!
<br />
<br />Nice to see you here!
<br />
<br />I'm already working on a new skin for the Anubis MK2. It should not look like the old one, as this is just unrealistic. I thought about texture similar to the Thoth. This way, the Monkey ships would look more like ships from one faction (the Horus would of course also be changed).
<br />
<br />The only thing why I did not include this in the last version was that I had some problems and needed too much time to solve these. But I'm trying to have new skins for all the original ship models used twice (Anubis MK2, Horus, Valkyrie N1) as soon as possible.
<br />
<br />For the Starwars ships I have to say that I like them very much, but do not want to add them to the mod. I always tried to keep the mod like the original FL and therefore use only ships that really fit into the original FL style and are not from any other space saga.
<br />
<br />I hope you agree with this.
<br />
<br />Have fun playing!

			<div class="content">How about a new faction called the Yankee Traders?
<br />
<br />They could be similar to the Zoners, but with the &quot;Let the buyer beware&quot; mentality that made them famous.  They could have a base in systems that are sparsely populated like out in the Galileo System.  
<br />
<br />They could sell every commodity there is, regardless if it's contraband.  New weapons and new ships also, with no player level restrictions.
<br />
<br />Missions would involve obtaining classified data that the Yankee Traders want to sell to the highest bidder.
<br />
<br />Anyway, just a thought I had.  If you or anyone else wants to incorporate this into your own MOD feel free, but please give me a &quot;thanks to&quot; for the idea.
<br />
<br />I would like to include this faction into a MOD that I'm working on but I haven't reached that skill level yet.  I'm still digging through the treads in the MOD making forums to lear how.  I wish there was a search feature for the tutorials.

			<div class="content">Hi Black Eagle! Abaout the MOD: AWSOME just about sums it up.
<br />
<br />However I am feeling slightly frustrated..... 
<br />
<br />The AI in random missions keep using sheild batteries and nanobots. 
<br />
<br />Dont get me wrong this adds a very pleasant level of dificulty to the game but whats annoying is that they restore only in little bits....
<br />
<br />Consequently it takes FOREVER to finish 1 Random mission....
<br />
<br />I just dont have the time to stick araund trying to kill the same old pirate for 30 BLEEDING MINUTES! DIE ALREADY YOU.....!!
<br />
<br />I think this would be solved if they restored in whole bars instead of just 1 Battery or Nanobot at a time.
<br />
<br />As some people will find the challenge quite to their tastes it would be fine if you could just tell me what line of code controlls this behavior.
<br />
<br />I have all the needed modding tools.
<br />
<br />Im running Monkyes Universe 1.84 Final Version.
<br />
<br />THANK YOU! PG.

			<div class="content">Hi guys!
<br />
<br />blackies: The idea about the faction sounds quite good, but I cannot see the difference to the zoners. They also buy and sell every good and do not look, if it is contraband or not.
<br />Ships without level restrictions to buy them would make the game to easy (this is at least my opinion). So, I think I will keep the zoners as only faction neutral to all. I'm anyway working especially on new ships, new equipment and new systems now. This will take some time and the next version (1.2) and maybe also the following version will &quot;only&quot; have new ships, new equipment and new systems, and no new factions. This is something I will not do for the next time, as I think that I can improve the mod with other things and with expanding the Nomad, the Order, the Monkeys and the Robots (e.g.: with missiles, mines, ships, systems, etc.).
<br />
<br />I hope you agree with this. However I would really like to see a mod from you with such a faction.
<br />As the forum search function was disabled some time ago due to server instability, finding the tutorials is a bit difficult. During the time of my modding experience I made a simple text file, in which many tutorials and forum threads are listed. It is separated in different parts (like factions, systems, etc.), but not totally in a special order. I think however that it could be helpful for you and if you want I can send it to you by mail.
<br />
<br />So, good luck with modding!
<br />
<br />PhotonGun: As you said, I made the AI using bots and bats, to make the game a bit more challenging. I know that on lower levels it might be a bit hard and maybe even boring to fight the enemies, as they are quite hard now. But, if you are on the highest levels (36-40) you now still have challenging missions and the game is still nice to play.
<br />I decided that the beginning can be a bit harder, if the end is then not so boring anymore (in vanilla FL, flying in a Titan or Sabre with Nomad weapons was quite boring). However, for the next version I'm trying to overwork the bot and bat using NPCs again and I will try to keep the game challenging without getting boring.
<br />I hope you will like this.
<br />
<br />If you want to change the NPCs by yourself you have two options:
<br />
<br />1. You can totally disable the bot and bat using of the NPCs:
<br />
<br />For this go to the pilots_population.ini in the Data/missions folder and search for the line &quot;repair_id = repair_fighter_both&quot;. Change all these lines to &quot;repair_id = repair_fighter_never&quot;. Then do the same thing with all the files &quot;repair_id = repair_fighter_both_ace&quot;
<br />
<br />2. You can also decrease the amount of bots and bats the NPCs are carrying:
<br />
<br />For this go to the loadouts.ini in the Data/ships folder and change all the lines with &quot;cargo = ge_s_battery_01, zzz&quot; and &quot;cargo = ge_s_repair_01, zzz&quot;. Change zzz to a number you like. You have to do this for every loadout in this file, as these loadouts are for all the fighters and freighters in the game that are flown by NPCs.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!
<br />
<br />See you all around!
<br />

			<div class="content">Problem&gt; The Mission after rescuing President Jacobi, Where you have to get a Nomad battery, Wont start. The Osiris dumps me saying it has to leave because the Jumphole is de-stabilizing. Fine so far. Now I move towards the Mission Waypoint.... When I get there nothing happens. Im in plain sight of the &quot;Nomad Lair&quot;.... Still nothing. I atack the Lair.... Nothing. I cant damage it or the Generators. Juni and King keep spouting battle chatter but there is not an enemy in sight. They also keep firing missiles randomly and seemingly without aim. If I get close to the generators and attack them Juni and King do the same... To no effect. The Timer, however, keeps going until I fail the mission. Help Please.

			<div class="content">Hi PhotonGun!
<br />
<br />I never had this problem and I do not know anyone else who had problems in this mission.
<br />
<br />To solve the problem you may want to try the following things:
<br />
<br />Load an old savegame one or two missions before and do the missions again. Maybe the mission then also works.
<br />
<br />If this does not help, I have some questions:
<br />
<br />Do you have any other mods active?
<br />Did you use old savegames from original FL or other mods?
<br />Did you just install FL and activated the mod afterwords?
<br />
<br />If the answer to one of these questions is yes, I can only say the following:
<br />
<br />My mod is not compatible with ANY other mod except of the &quot;OpenSP for the Monkeys&quot; mod released by myself some months before.
<br />Old savegames from the original non-modded game or from other mods will not work with my mod, you have to start newly.
<br />Please, before activating the mod, install the SDK, which you can download here at TLR.
<br />
<br />If you cannot solve the problem and also could answer no to all the three questions, please post again and I will try to find a solution.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps!
<br />
<br />Black Eagle</div>
