			<div class="content">is it me or have the past few threads questioning the moderation of this site struck a nerve in some of the higher ups that possibly they &quot;sweep under the rug&quot; the complaints and critisism of their site? This has sparked a MAJOR mystery and quite possibly the most INTERESTING plot for a novel (just make the &quot;site&quot; a governmental body <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ). My wife and i were talking over dinner tonight and she read the posts on this thread as well as a few other threads i have saved as text files and we agreed on the following....
<br />
<br />*pulls out the conspiracy theory movie reel, get your popcorn!*
<br />
<br />A site, full of turmoil and post counts dropping sharply, the main focus of the site &quot; The Lancer Series..&quot; starring..&quot;Starlancer&quot; and co-starring &quot;Freelancer&quot;. Now the starlancer game is pretty dead...Freelancer had its run and is slowly dying as well...The addition of  the new games is slowly making things worse. How to keep the site active. The a Coup starts...*Enter the terrorist leader TAW...(evil music)* The site has changed hands and slowly the corrupt government *Enter the Admins and Mods...(evil music again)* Slowly the voice of the people (us) is being changed, our thoughts cast aside for the &quot;true order&quot; and dream of the newly appointed leaders. In doing this, the revolution lead by the evil terrorist leader taw begins its coup de tas and begins to speak up in open protest over the tyrannical approach in rejecting of the basic freedom of speech...Taw is cast away in a battle of wits and foul language. Weeks pass, another person speaks out against this dictatorship...they are as well run out and silenced...order is restored once again......
<br />
<br />  Now, we come to a new voice of the people...a rousing discussion arises, opinions and ideas are spawned...the voices are getting louder..then in ONE simple action the masses are silenced once again by the masters...the masses go silent until a faint wisper is heard in the corner of OT...the cycle begins again. *to be continued*
<br />
<br />
<br />Now if you look at it like that, it seems like a GREAT suspence story. So her and i came to an &quot;idea&quot; that possibly the people in question are manipulating this situation to make the site more interesting again? I bet the post counts have gone up a quite a bit today? Now going on that assumption (just a theory), the puppet master has made quite the story for people to eat up and therefore keeping the forum fresh and exciting! An ingenious idea to say the least. All teh anger no matter how genuine and how many times people say &quot;I will never post here again&quot;, if people get word that a voice has spoke up again, the original posters come back to help try and get the place back to normal!! What better way for the staff to get their &quot;valued&quot; members back...But if thats the case its just sick and inexcuseable! 
<br />
<br />Add to the mixture the DELETION of a thread that was going on pretty civaly and BLAM!!! The story continues and their site stays afloat!
<br />
<br />Just a crazy idea that my wife thought of...it does seem like they are palying us in some sick mannor...either a sick game like that...OR trying to hide behind the mods as we waste our ammo on the innocent which is the case as it seems now. For the innocent all i can do is apologize for the shrapnel you have aquired...and the mass of casualties is alarming, loss of posters, anger tearing people apart...i do hope that the people involved in the heinous actions that have taken place today are satisfied with themselves..for they have slowly but surely hurt many people in their twisted ways. I emplore you to make amends and take the ideas that former posters have given to you, for they are nothing more than helpful ideas that will give a new life to this place. So please take responcibility for your actions and apologize, then the rest of us can slowly let the battle wounds heal over time <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> We are/were friends here at one time. So DON NOT let friendships end like this. 
<br />
<br />A final note...Is having &quot;power&quot; so great that letting the people that you serve suffer from infighting and hatred? If power is that important to you, then a family site is not what you should be &quot;moderating and or administrating&quot; what ever the position the deleter is. IF so i pity you and hope that you can come to terms with your own short sightedness and  self loathing that you may be a more productive member of society. This thought is NOT directed to ANYONE but the person who deleted the original thread noone ELSE. So whoever you are...think about that.
<br />
<br />Its a sad day today..<img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content"><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Bull. Bargib resigned of his own accord because he had real-life obligations and no-one got angry at that. Everone got angry because A NEW GAME FORUM WAS ADDED WITH NO REFERANCE TO THE COMMUNITY BY BP AND OTHERS AND THEN - this is why people are angry - BP TOLD EVERYONE WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT TO BUGGER OFF ! I cannot believe you can't see that. 
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Come on Neo, like Wolfy said, some wanted it, some didn't - but the sites direction is not your decision to make. Like any site in the world, its the administrators decision - because they are the ones that do all the work and run the place.
<br />There was plenty of loud complaining, and in our defence, we explained and explained and explained the reasons over and over again, but for some that just isn't good enough. Everyone likes to say 'we the community weren't listened to' - but that goes both ways! What we explained was being ignored entirely as well, and we just got lambasted even more...... Maybe BP lost his patience, is that suprising? I am not saying mistakes have not been made/errors of judgement - but it didn't warrent the kind of action we were receiving over it.
<br />As to any other comments, I have work (and am late already) - I will post more later.</div>

<br />
<br />I agree Esq, that's why we are working on a solution for that. We are trying to create several websites within the website if you will, so people will get to see only what they want to see (they would get to choose their game on the mainpage). FL fans would only see FL content, DS fans would only get to see DS content etc. It's still in very early stages, but know we are working on a solution.

			<div class="content">Hey Gowser, good to see you. I haven't seen half of you mods in quite a while <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />Ahem, so now we have;
<br />Dark_Shadow (the thread creator)
<br />Chips
<br />Final
<br />Wizard
<br />Harrier
<br />Parabolix
<br />BP
<br />Eraser (he hasn't said so definatively, but I'm certain that he would)
<br />Gowserpaul 
<br />
<br />
<br />All of whom deny deleting the thread in question. The list is becoming shorter, and we're still waiting mysterious thread deleter. Don't you think that we deserve to know why the thread was deleted? We are a *community* here aren't we?

			<div class="content">I have to admit that the deletion of that thread has annoyed me somewhat.  You all know that I rarely post nowadays, and in that particular case I spent a lot of time and effort trying to communicate my reasons for leaving...only to be completely ignored (not one person responded to my post) and then to have the entire thread deleted.
<br />
<br />This is exactly why the membership has dropped around here.  Someone around here is on a power trip and is not honest or decent enough to stand up and admit that it was he that deleted the thread.  This person is spineless imo.  Whoever it was obviously felt strong enough about the thread to delete it, but now won't even step forward to justify his actions.  I'm sorry but thats just pathetic.
<br />
<br />I do not agree or disagree strongly with any of you about your comments on how this site has change, for the better or worse.  IMO its actually quite black and white...the site changed hands, the new moderation made decisions that they could rightfully make, the regulars stood against a few of the decisions, the mods chose to ignore a number of the comments and clamped down, the regulars used their feet to do the talking.  Its as simple as that.  No matter what anyone's opinion of the moderation around here may be, it is actually their decision to make....that doesn't make it right, but I'd suggest anyone who still disagrees with the changes simply stands up and leaves....in the end, its the mods that own and run this place, they can do with it whatever they like.
<br />
<br />However, saying all of that the deletion of that particular thread p*ssed me off.  It finally looked as if the regulars and the mods were openly discussing their issues with each other *without* a large amount of flaming.  Whichever chicken sh** person deleted it, without explanation, has some serious psychological problems...the phrase &quot;power trip&quot; is simply not strong enough.
<br />
<br />Surely, no-one expects this place to get back to its old friendly ways if you can't even post a genuinely constructive thread without threat of it being deleted by someone on a power trip.  Why should we waste our time posting at all?  Have people forgotten that the members of TLR are not just the *only* way that TLR can survive (whats the point of a site if no-one visits it?) but also are dedicated enough to take great care and attention in posting in-depth replies that they expect to be read and *not* deleted?
<br />
<br />I for one, want the person responsible to stand up, be a man and explain why he deleted that thread.  Otherwise there is simply no trust left for the TLR members to rely on.</div>

<br />
<br />16 moderators? Jesus... I thought there were only 8 or 9... I see now why Taw packed up and left...
<br />
<br />I'm not the only one who's noticed this I'm sure, but as soon as somebody makes a comment that could be considered as spiteful or remotely nasty, it's deleted! I quite openly voiced my opinion in a thread yesterday using (fair enough) a curse, (A/K/A 'a man's genitalia'), and today, have a guess what... It's gone!
<br />
<br />What a surprise... This is more of a dictatorship than a community... So much for the freedom-of-speech laws we all so gladly take for granted in our everyday lives... Whatever happened to the days where a moderator EDITED a post, not simply deleted it for God's sake? And to delete a whole thread because it might 'upset someone', I'm sure we can all take it on the chin!
<br />
<br />Now it takes a fair bit to wind me up, but the amount of secrecy on TLR is damn near driving me insane! I know my forums are as dead as Moses but even I keep the community posted ib what's happening!
<br />
<br />This site mightaswell be called Lancers Dictator... 'Cos none of us have a say in new things...</div>

			<div class="content">To gromit, and others, your replies and posts are noted, but a reply/reponce to them is not alway needed. You posted your feelings, and I for one like to let it stand, unless I have a point with anything, and then I would ask a question. As to who ever deleted the thread? Does it matter now? No. This is a replacement thread to offer opinions for or agaist. Feed back is nessisary, weather it is acted on or not. Like I tell people at work, I can't fix something, if I don't know its broke, and I won't know its broke, unless they speak up. 
<br />
<br />The anger needs to die down, and get back to points that can be looked at and worked with. Give it time, a solution can be worked out. You may not agree with all points, but, such is life.

<br />
<br />I believe that you couldn't be more wrong.  I think the people who spent their hard earned time typing out lengthy opinions, deserve to know why their work was deleted without explanation.  I know that you like to &quot;sweep things under the carpet&quot;, but I'm afraid that this action iterated exactly the fundamental problem with TLR that people have been complaining about for months.  People don't mind having to filter their swearing or avoid certain subjects, but when their comments and opinions are deleted for no good reason, by someone who is too pathetic to stand up and admit that they did it, then there is DEFINITELY a problem.  So YES, it DOES matter.
<br />

<br />
<br />very true, my point exactly....but if you speak up and then have their opinions deleted for no apparent reason?  how would you feel?
<br />
<br />I can't stress enough how much I actually appreciate(d?) the effort that goes into this site by the mod team...but surely you can understand that the people of TLR don't like to be pushed around like children?
<br />
<br />Will we ever find out the reason for yesterday's constructive thread being deleted?  I very much doubt it.  Unless of course, they offer spine transplants around here.

<br />
<br />The reasons for leaving are out numbering the reasons for staying.  I for one still play Freelancer so I come here because of that and hopes to feed my addiction but it&#8217;s like all the good stuff was taken out and I am now on placeboes (sugar pills).
<br />
<br />So, I don&#8217;t know.  What should we do?
<br />
<br />Maybe we could fix it instead of complaining, I&#8217;d hate to see the site die.  I&#8217;ll see what I can come up with on interesting discussion posts.  I&#8217;ll try not to make it too weak but really deep and juicy maybe.  Just to see what happens, then make a decision.

<br />The thread seemed to be going okay, but little things, like the deletion of Taw's post have weirded me out slightly. I'd really like whoever deleted it to come forward and tell us. Only Mods and the thread creators could have deleted that, and if some moderators are unaware of what's been going on, then there's something wrong with TLR.</div>

			<div class="content">well, Esky, put me up on the list of innocents, I was rather liking the thread, and it finally turned for the better, with many of the people reacting to each other, that were not out of anger or enraged. Im seriosuly angry at whoever did it, don't you see that by doing this you are in effect proving all those criticists right??
<br />
<br />I hope whoever did it, reconsiders to post it in here, and has the guts to take the opinions against him, as fact!!</div>
