			<div class="content">&gt;&gt;&gt;Note to Mods.  I put this in the OT because it seemed a safer location to allow talk that may shave things a little close on talking about spoilers.  I pray for your collective indulgences on this.&lt;&lt;&lt;  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Sir Spectre tried earlier to get people to put some thoughts down about a Prequel/Retraction of FL (1).  I thought it was a great idea and put some thoughts out on the thread but it didn't prompt much discussion.
<br />
<br />Is anyone interested to playing around with developing a complete story for ANY game.  Here is what I posted up on Sir Spectre's thread to give you and idea of what I am referring to.
<br />
<br />I had hoped that it would prompt some discussion but it really didn't do much... well OK, it did trigger one issue, the location of FP7 which I originally had got wrong but Chips sorted that out.  And now look at his MOD.
<br />
<br />Anyone out there care to talk about putting together Storie_s_ (I emphasize the plural) for an SL, FL, or any other Prequel or Sequel?
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>  Suggestion for Prequel Storyline:
<br />
<br />Trents Dad, a GMG merc, killed in action during end of the 80 Years War. Mom, a freigher pilot, killed by a renegade faction of Junkers who were slavers who hi-jacked her freigher. Trent raised by you-know-who (&quot;YKW&quot;, another ex-GMG merc.
<br />
<br />YKW apprentices and trains Trent, when T turns 18, YKW gives him a Dagger repaired from a wreck equipped with class 1 BR guns. Trent sets off to avenge his mother and in the process comes across clues to a fortune that his Dad left behind somewhere in Sigma space.
<br />
<br />YKW has a posse of ex-GMG mercs who fly Falcons and Hawks and also operate an old Kusari Battleship as their base. They also are looking for not just Trent's Dad's fortune but one left behind by the GMG Merc fleet when they were caught by surprise by the entire Rheinland fleet that was headed to the big showdown.
<br />
<br />Renegade Junkers hang out in Edinburgh.
<br />
<br />Retractions
<br />Dublin still has mineable gas clouds.
<br />Freeport 7 still exists, somehwere in / near Liberty.
<br />The Glorious is still in operation.
<br />Ships power units were capable of only 75% of the firepower of ships &quot;today.&quot;
<br />Shield Batteries cost 5 times as much and worked half as well.
<br />Nanobots did not exist.
<br />VHFs did not exist. - No Anubises, Eagles, Sabres or Titans.
<br />No Classes 8 or 9 weapons existed.
<br />The Special Class 10 weapons drains all power after 6 successive
<br />shots ... they are mountable on the ships even if the max is class 1
<br />on the ship. The lower the max, the fewer the shots you can get off.
<br />Class 1 limited ship would be a one shot wonder with a class 10 mounted.
<br />
<br />Campaign/Missions
<br />
<br />Avenge mother and pursue Dad's fortune alone - or - Avenge mother and join up with YKW's <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> mercs to find the lost GMG Merc Fleet's hoard.
<br />
<br />Ending mission to get the final clue for Dad's fortune. End of story line: Trent head's off to Freeport 7.
<br />
<br />Central Enemies: Renegade Junkers, Hogosha, Bundschuh, Mollies all in cahoots to find the GMG Merc hoard for themselves.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Edited to acknowledge Chips superior information instead of my wild a**ed guess on FP7's location.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

			<div class="content">I like it. Only, I didn't know trent was such a good fighter pilot before the Nomad storyline <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Maybe the role of Trent could be played by Trents Dad, who is avanging his dad (Trents Grandfahther)
<br />Trents dad avenges his parents and meets his future wife along the way.
<br />They might never find the fortune, wich leaves a nice Sequal for Trent: The hunt for the gold.
<br />Another reason I disconnected Trent directly from this plot is because I don't realy know when the 80 Years war was, but it was way before Trents time, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.
<br />
<br />It would be taking place mostly in Brettonia, wouldn't it? If not, doesn't realy matter.
<br />
<br />Tobias is Trents Uncle? He could help Trents dad avenge his parents. They're his parents aswell <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />No need to include FP7 though they could stop by there, just as the story unfolds.FP7 doesn't have to be important in the story.
<br />
<br />Well, just some thoughts to get you started <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I'd love to help out and throw in more ideas if you want.
<br />
<br />Edit: <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Freeport 7 still exists, somehwere in / near Liberty.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Wasn't it Sigma 17? Certainly not in any house space.

<br />Well, if you consider that T (you) is (are) supposed to be able to fend for him(your)self in that cheesey Starflier with all of 2 Justice 1 lasers at the start of FL, it is not totally out of the storyline logic for him to be fairly accomplished at piloting.
<br />
<br />The &quot;80&quot; need not have been that long ago, especially if you consider that a lot of the those special weps are vulnerable to radiation deterioration.  A natural logic that flows from the game is that if they're out too long the weps and the ships would be too far gone for anyone to take advantage of them.  If the &quot;80&quot; ended when T was like an infant and all, it could make T around 20-something for the beginning of FL.  Also, the economic after-effects of it are regularly harped upon in the Rheinland bars so it suggests that it could not have been that long ago.
<br />
<br />I thought about suggesting the Prequel to be about T's Dad but that seemed too Star Wars-ey.  But I like making the gold hunt, yet another segment.  That would make a Pre-Prequel and a Prequel. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Hmmm.  Tobias as Uncle.  Uncle Toby. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_clown.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Maybe but sometimes making key characters so closely related by blood makes it less easy to introduce new protagonists because then you'd have to work out how the blood line would work and, well, I'm no Frank Herbert. 
<br />
<br />I agree about FP7 too. ....but the purpose was to make the Prequel idea sort of *snick*  right into the FL beginning movie.
<br />
<br />Proof against location of FP 7 at Sigma 17:   If you click on Sir S's link, you will find a round of discussion on that point.  While most would agree with you from a visual association standpoint, we have Chips rather definitively locating FP7 in Liberty space.  Chips basically has the game coding deconstructed.
<br />
<br />@Gowerspaul.
<br />
<br />Thanks. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>   Any plot ideas?  What about a plot for SL X?  WC X?  Elite X?

			<div class="content">About FP7, I know that. But that's just digital stuff. In the game FP7 is in Sigma 17, the guys at DA just made a copy of S17 with only FP7 in that system and coded it as FP7 instead of S17, wich is ofcourse because you can't have two systems with the same name.
<br />They used the FP7 system only for the intro. The game tells you through rumors and debree that FP7 was infact in S17.
<br />So storywise, it would be more logical to place FP7 in S17.
<br />
<br />The idea of Tobias as an uncle was nothing more than a question, I didn't know if he was actually an uncle or just a friend.
<br />
<br />About the goldhunt, you could make that a sequal. T needs something to keep him occupied after kicking the nomads and since Juni isn't likely to contact him soon, the treasurehunt seems a good idea to me <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Yeah, let him avenge his parents, kick the nomads and hunt for his dad's gold. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">&lt;&lt;&lt;Note to mods: sorry about the double posting but my post would be to big and confusing&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Ok, I got an idea about this. I hope I'm not acting to prematurely. I don't want to steal your thing. It's just a sugestion, because I like the idea <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Before I start: does GMG operate in and around Brettonia? I doubt it, therefore in this version T's mom worked for IMG.
<br />
<br /><b>Stage 1: </b>
<br />
<br />T and Tobias fly around Planet Leeds to practice T's flying skills some more when they here his mom request for help.
<br />They both fly to the scene but are to late. They scan for survivors and T tractors in a heavily injured pilot. 
<br />They want to bring him to a hospital on Leeds but run into a wing of Junkers who want to kill them. They don't understand why. They survive, land on Leeds and bring the pilot to a hospital. He's unconsious(sp?) so he can't tell anything.
<br />T wants to investigate things on his own and leaves although Tobias begs him to stay. (they get into a big fight over it ofcourse)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Stage 2: </b>
<br />
<br />Outside Leeds he is being awaited by a Merc. He tells T that the attack was about the cargo and that his mom wasn't transporting anything for the IMG that day.
<br />
<br />He takes T to Holman Outpost (IMG base) in Tau-31 to discuss the matter. On their way they're attacked by Junkers. They defeat them and land savely at Holman.
<br />
<br />On Holman the merc tells T he was asigned to escort the transport wich T's mom was part of. He could escape in time but he scanned the transports and saw they were carrying <i>something </i> (dunno yet) wich the Junkers wanted.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />That's what I could come up with in just 30 minutes. It get's T started and gives him an ally, the merc. It also raises some questions wich they need to answer: <i>What do the Junkers want with the cargo and why did the IMG transport it? Were the Junkers hired by someone else, or are they operating alone? How did they know about the transport? </i>
<br />I did this because avenging his mom alone isn't enough for a whole story.
<br />The unconsious(still sp?) pilot (junker or escort) needs to wake up because he might have some info. but he might get killed by another merc hired by the enemy.
<br />The enemy are the Junkers and possibly another faction.
<br />
<br />I made the attack happen in Leeds, where T lives.
<br />If the attack happened outside Leeds, he would not be there in time and probably learn about his mom's death another way and then start of the story would be different.
<br />
<br />So, what do you say?

<br />FP7 at Sigma 17.  Hmmmm.  You know I've wanted to think that too but I have admit that there is one problem with that.  Sigma 17 is too far away from Liberty space for the retrieval and rescue to have been executed by Liberty elements.  Although I guess there is the Atka facility somewhat close by.
<br />
<br />&lt;Hey Chips.... if you are reading this thread.....Does what Nick say make sense?&gt;
<br />
<br />I like your scenes.  No, you're not stealing anything..... THIS is what I wanted to try to get going on this thread!  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  You know, sort of try to flesh out the whole story.
<br />
<br />Leeds is a good place for the fighting, maybe off toward LD14 for the ominousness of it .  I guess I should clarify with you that YKW = Tobias in case I was not being clear.
<br />
<br />Regarding GMG, the DID operate in Bretonia.  E.G. - The Glorious in Dublin System.
<br />GMG were all over the place as long as there were mine-able gas fields to exploit.
<br />
<br />What would you have T flying to start?  The reconditioned Dagger?  Weps?
<br />
<br />@Anyone.  
<br />
<br />Care to chime in?  Change, add?  Criticize?

<br />
<br />I discarded that as one of the mayor flaws in the game. It would have made so much more scence if they would have been transported to Kusari or Rheinland.
<br />I think MS/DA had their minds made up about the story (Rheinland badguys, Liberty goodguys) before they figured out where to bring T and co.
<br />
<br />We could leave FP7 out of this prequal and thereby go around this isue. All we have to do is at the end mention T leaving for FP7 without mentionning the system.
<br />
<br />Also, remember the rumor that T had a girl on Leeds but he left her to go for his milion creds? We should include that too.

<br />
<br />I chose Holman in Tau 31 because it was the closest IMG base I could find.
<br />Giving it a second thought though, LD-14 is a BMM base and Junkers are BMM enemies. IMG have only Outcatst and Corsairs as enemies.
<br />Maybe we should change IMG into BMM?
<br />
<br />Oh and YKW=Tobias was quite obvious <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />As for a starting ship... Dagger or Piranha. Almost the same stats, only a dagger has a turretmount.
<br />
<br />Starting loadout:
<br />2x Adv. Starbeam class 2 guns
<br />Armet LF class 1 shield
<br />Thruster
<br />3x Shield Batteries
<br />3x Nanno Bots
<br />
<br />Applicable for both ships.
<br />
<br />We can turn it down to class 1 guns, but that would turn out to be almost the same loadout as the game and Starbeams are actually sold on Leeds, so they could get there hands on them very easy, just like the shield.

<br />
<br />Yeah.  BMM .  Good point.  I was looking at LD14 to give T a shot at upgrading some weps while playing hide and seek with the baddies in the asteroids you gotta figure that it makes sense that the place would be littered with wrecks plus some fresh kills.
<br />
<br />The mission into Tau31 could be the next part of the story.  You know, the chase after the first battle.  Say one of the Junkers who runs away from the LD14 shootout has special info so that he needs to be caught somewhere around Holman... the tractor in his lifepod scenario.
<br />
<br />I was wondering whether we really need to get T started so low.    I mean, what if the starting loadout for T is a Dagger with, say 3 class 4 guns, 1 class 3 turret and 1 class 1 missile system with maybe 10 missiles?
<br />
<br />Oh.  And who would be T's merc friend.  Another female you think?

<br />Next mission into Tau 31 is a good one.
<br />
<br />We now need to figure out what we want to be on those transports, it has to be something valuable to the Junkers and there has to be a reason it's valuable to them.
<br />I was thinking along the lines of a weapon, but I'm not even sure why the Junkers want a big secret weapon and how in the world BMM got a hold of it.
<br />
<br />It could also be something they discovered in the LD-14 astroidfield.
<br />Or perhaps they were liberating a prisoner.
<br />Maybe someone who was escorting the transport was carrying along some classified documents.
<br />
<br />Could be anything.

<br />The reason for starting off with a better equipped ship is because it would good if
<br />you could take pressure off of T to get a better ship to give him and is friends more time to fight and hunt for clues.  At least in the beginning.  After all, he's going to run into Kusari and Rheinland soon enough, not to mention Outcasts.
<br />
<br />OK.  What did the Junkers seize?  Now it gets sort of tricky.  I've got some suggestions.....
<br />
<br />1) Could be a Dom Kavosh map of Pygar.  
<br />2) Could be another active artifact but this one does something else like, say, generate power without consuming any fuel.  
<br />3) Could be alien scrap &quot;bio&quot; metal.  
<br />4) Could be incriminating evidence about a conspiracy in Rheinland that sabotaged the Imperial Fleet in the big showdown involving the Junkers and Bundschuh.
<br />5) Could be an immense hoard of diamonds, cardamine, artifacts.......</div>

<br />
<br />We have artifacts already in the original FL story and diamonds or other valuable stuff isn't interresting enough imho.
<br />
<br />I'm in for the conspiracy theory. I take it you mean the 80 years war?

<br />
<br />I like the conspiracy because it helps to rationalize how a bunch of gas miners, even with the background help of a House could defeat the full might of a House. .... Especially the Rheinland House when you take into account what seems to have been the most advanced war making technology of the four ... at least the most powerful.
<br />
<br />But if we use this line, we have to work the facts of the conspiracy into the story as either background logic for actions taken or as mission objectives.</div>
