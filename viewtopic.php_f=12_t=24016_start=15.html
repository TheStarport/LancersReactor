			<div class="content">How the Grinch stole our vision of perfect objects
<br />Author: Peter Coffee
<br />Every Coder in Codeville liked objects a lot.
<br />&quot;Tested,&quot; &quot;reusable,&quot; that's what was hot.
<br />But the Grinch of reality sulked in his cave
<br />Saying, &quot;Hear them all talk of the time that they'll save!&quot;
<br />
<br />The Grinch hated Coders, and liked them to sweat.
<br />He thought, &quot;I can make them unhappy, I'll bet!&quot;
<br />He read through 12 texts, then looked up with a grin:
<br />&quot;Why, this is as good as original sin!&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />He read with a chortle, &quot;An object or class
<br />Is like a black box hiding all that it has.
<br />Its details invisible: All that you know
<br />Is what should go in and what answers will show.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />He slunk to the West Coast and into a lab
<br />Where chip engineers were at work in their fab.
<br />He heard their boss saying, &quot;Forget testing tricks:
<br />This one is the same as a 486!&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />His chance had now come. From their math microcode
<br />He struck out one line as it went to download.
<br />And the Grinch watched with barely containable glee
<br />As the chips with their bugs shipped across land and sea.
<br />
<br />
<br />And each of those chips went to some happy buyer
<br />Where some just played games, but most were for hire
<br />Sending up spacecraft or buying up stocks
<br />Or predicting the timing of quake aftershocks.
<br />
<br />
<br />Then the bug story broke! And the Grinch was alarmed.
<br />This news came too early! Too few had been harmed!
<br />But the Grinch soon calmed down, as the months marched on by
<br />And the chip-making people continued to lie.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;We fixed it!&quot; they said, and now that was quite funny:
<br />You couldn't get fixed chips for love or for money.
<br />&quot;It's really no problem,&quot; they added in chorus.
<br />&quot;The errors are rare. Stop whining, you bore us.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />So everywhere, Coders were having to ask
<br />&quot;Just how does this chip do its float-divide task?&quot;
<br />Internals that they had been told to ignore
<br />Now had to be studied in blood and in gore.
<br />
<br />
<br />The leading bit patterns whose answers were wrong
<br />And whether the errors were carried along,
<br />All had to be thoroughly well understood
<br />So the Coders could know if their answers were good.
<br />
<br />
<br />And the Grinch went off happy. He knew that they'd learned
<br />That quality output still has to be earned.
<br />Beyond &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; they'd learned something greater:
<br />&quot;If you don't test it now, you'll just debug it later.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />-- With apologies to the late Theodore Geisel
<br />

			<div class="content">If Dr. Seuss had written for ER
<br />Author: Brent Fogel
<br />Kerry: Now Mark, I think this ER's great,
<br />But...there are problems that can't wait!
<br />Now Benton's fine, and Carter too,
<br />But Ross and Susan just won't do!
<br />Now who do you think that we should hire,
<br />Since both of them today I'll fire?
<br />
<br />
<br />Mark: Kerry, maybe we should wait and see...
<br />
<br />
<br />Kerry: That's great Mark! I knew you would agree...
<br />
<br />
<br />Jerry: Dr. Weaver? Sorry to interrupt...
<br />But the paramedics just pulled up.
<br />
<br />
<br />Mark: Ok, I'm here. What have you got?
<br />
<br />
<br />Shep: This little boy has just been shot!
<br />His pulse is faint, his breath is weak.
<br />We did all we could to stop the leak.
<br />
<br />
<br />Riley: And this woman here, she has a broken hip...
<br />
<br />
<br />Carol: How did she fall? How did she trip?
<br />
<br />
<br />Shep: The kid's mom was getting in my hair,
<br />So I shoved her--lightly--down some stairs.
<br />
<br />
<br />Mark: Benton, Kerry! Take the mom to three!
<br />Doug and Susan! Come with me!
<br />
<br />
<br />Riley: But wait, but wait! Oh don't you see?
<br />We've got some more; one, two, and three.
<br />
<br />
<br />Kerry: You've got three more? How can this be?
<br />Explain it, tell it all to me!
<br />
<br />
<br />Riley: Well, Shep was driving. Really fast.
<br />A light turned red. Shep hit the gas.
<br />We hit a car, it hit two more.
<br />Soon the total rose by four.
<br />Another bang! Another crash!
<br />But we couldn't stay, we had to dash!
<br />We grabbed these three but I am sure,
<br />The injured totaled sixty score!
<br />
<br />
<br />Carter: These people really are a mess!
<br />Their injuries I cannot guess!
<br />It makes me sick, my knees are weak,
<br />A toilet I must soon go seek...
<br />
<br />
<br />Benton: It's ok Carter! Stay on your toes!
<br />It doesn't get worse than this you know!
<br />To Trauma four let's take these three.
<br />You can do it, come with me!
<br />
<br />
<br />Green: Ok, let's get this boy on the table.
<br />To save his life if we are able!
<br />
<br />
<br />Haleh: Dr. Green! This boy is cyanotic!
<br />I can't find a pulse...oh, wait I've got it!
<br />But it is weak! Oh, woe is us!
<br />
<br />
<br />Doug: Give him saline! IV push!
<br />CBC, chem 7, stat!
<br />We will save him, bet on that!
<br />Oh no, he's showing poor perfusion!
<br />Lydia, start a blood tranfusion!
<br />
<br />
<br />Lydia: But Dr. Ross, I hate to say.
<br />The blood bank didn't come today!
<br />We're out of blood, I can't believe!
<br />
<br />
<br />Doug: Here, use mine! (rolls up his sleeve)
<br />
<br />
<br />Kerry: We need some help! There's been a crash!
<br />Someone's heart stopped with a flash!
<br />But Dr. Benton saved the day,
<br />And Carter's going to be ok.
<br />
<br />
<br />Susan: What can I do, where can I go?
<br />I'm not incompetent you know!
<br />I deserve a chance and with good reason,
<br />I only killed one guy last season!
<br />
<br />
<br />Chloe: Hey, Suze? Look! It's me...
<br />I doing great...oh, can't you see?
<br />I'm back on drugs and feeling woozy,
<br />Can you take care of little Susie?
<br />
<br />
<br />Susan: Not now Chloe! I'm in a panic!
<br />
<br />
<br />Kerry: Get Susan out, she can't handle it!
<br />
<br />
<br />Mark: It's fine! It's done, the kid's ok.
<br />We're sending him up on his way.
<br />To surgery he's off to go,
<br />They must sew up that bullet hole.
<br />But Dr. Ross, he's out of sorts...
<br />We had to take a dozen quarts.
<br />
<br />
<br />Benton: Ok, we're done. I did it all.
<br />I used a double breasted suture saw.
<br />I closed them up, I fixed their ills.
<br />I patched their wounds, I gave them pills.
<br />I have their livers in this sack.
<br />I did it all, behind my back.
<br />I need more patients, give me more!
<br />I just cured three, now give me four!
<br />
<br />
<br />Carter: What happened? Did I miss it all?
<br />I saw some blood. I took a fall.
<br />But it doesn't matter, we saved the day!
<br />
<br />
<br />Carol: Get ready! There's more on the way!
