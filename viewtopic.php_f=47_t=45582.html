			<div class="content">Chapter 1: The Escape from Islay
<br />
<br />When Mark sat in the bar on Islay Base, a message on the news board catched
<br />his eye. It said ''New systems discovered''. When he read it a bit closer,
<br />he could read: ''Our best pilots, who where searching for jumpholes for a long
<br />time, have finally found new systems. We will start to colonize them as
<br />soon as possible. We needed new systems because we are losing the battle
<br />against Bretonia. Some Bounty Hunters have told the Armed Forces where 
<br />our Islay Base is. Our spies have already confirmed that some battleships
<br />were reassigned to the Edinburgh system. We need to get out of here as soon
<br />as possible.'' 
<br />Mark was a freelancer, but when he traveled trough Bretonia, he met
<br />some Gaians. He liked them and the cause they were fighting for.
<br />His home was on Planet Los Angeles, but he hadn't been there
<br />for about 7 years.
<br />His father was also a freelancer, who had disappeared somewhere in 
<br />the Tau-systems.
<br />His mother was still on Los Angeles, raising Stephen, Mark's little brother.
<br />However, Stephen was not actually a ''little brother'' anymore, because he was
<br />now 23 years old. Mark was 31. Stephen had always wanted to be a
<br />freelancer. Mark guessed Stephen was also a freelancer now.
<br />Mark silently hoped that he would see his family again.
<br />But the chance was really small, especially when he would go the new systems 
<br />with the Gaians. 
<br />Suddenly, he heard an alarm. ''Code Red, Code Red'' ''Leave the Base immediatly,
<br />we are attacked by Bretonian Forces!'' 
<br />Mark ran to his Hawk, activated it and launched to space.
<br />When he saw the battleships, he was surprised. 6 battleships and
<br />around 45 Crusaders! He knew the Gaians couldn't win. 
<br />''Boom!'' A missile had hit him and his shield was down. There was a Crusader on 
<br />his tail. Mark used some shield batteries. ''Zooof'' Another missile. The 
<br />missile pushed his Hawk towards an asteroid. He dodged the asteroid, looked 
<br />back, and saw that the Crusader flew against the asteroid. It exploded.
<br />Suddenly, he heard a voice over the com channel. ''Fereniz!'' ''We need to flee!'' It was Commodore Atmore. ''Yes, but to where?'' Mark replied. 
<br />''There is a jumphole in sector 7B!'' ''Follow me'' said Commodore Atmore.
<br />Mark followed...

			<div class="content">Chapter 2 : Reunion
<br />
<br />When Mark docked with the jumphole, he had no idea where Atmore was
<br />taking him. He would soon find out.
<br />On the other side of the jumphole was a system full of ice clouds. Mark 
<br />guessed he was in the middle of the Barrier.
<br />''Mark, do you know where we are?'' asked Atmore. ''No'' Mark said 
<br />''Well, we're in the Tau-22 system. The first system discovered recently.''
<br />While they were talking, many ships undocked with the jumphole. Mark and
<br />Atmore looked at them. Then, suddenly, some ships undocked.
<br />They weren't Gaians. They were Bounty Hunters. ''All Gaians, engage!'' said Atmore. Soon, Mark had a Barracuda on this tail. A missile struck him. Foozzzz..
<br />His shield was down, and half of his ship was gone. The Hawk had only one wing
<br />left. Another missile was coming after him. He couldn't evade it... his end was
<br />near. But then, he saw someone shooting on the missile and launching a torpedo at the Barracuda. Voooffzzzz. The Barracuda was gone. When he took
<br />a look at the contact list, he saw that his rescuer was labeled Gordon Brent.
<br />He was amazed! He thought he would never see Gordon again! ''Come on, we
<br />must get outta here,now!'' ''Follow me''said Gordon over the com channel. Mark 
<br />activated his cruise engine. ''Where are we going'' asked Mark ''We're going to
<br />Jutland Base. It's a small base of Gaians.'' Gordon responded.
<br />When they landed at Jutland, Mark asked Gordon where he had been the last
<br />few months. ''Well, after we flew together in Omega-7, I have worked as a freelancer in Bretonia. Just like you, apperently. After some time, I got bored and missed my old friend. I went searching for you. And here we are are, together.'' 
<br />''Come on, let's go drink a Sidewinder Fang, just like in old times!'' Mark said...

			<div class="content">Chapter 3: Closing the Jumphole and becoming a hero
<br />
<br />The next day, the Gaian commander, Kevin Lutenham, said something to all Gaians, over the com channel: ''Best Gaians, I've just taken a decision.'' ''We need to close the jumphole to Edinburgh.'' ''Bretonia is constanly sending battleships trough it, and Bounty Hunters are now a plague here.'' ''I need some volunteers to go close the jumphole.'' 
<br />Gordon looked at Mark. Mark got the message. They were going to close it! They were bored anyway. However, it was very dangerous. That was no problem for the two friends.
<br />
<br />A few minutes later...
<br />Mark and Gordon were sitting in the commanders room. Lutenham was
<br />saying: ''It's very brave of you to do this, but still, you getting some men with you.'' 
<br />''How many wingmen do we get, asked Mark.'' ''About 6, that's all that I could find,
<br />I'm afraid.''responded Lutenham.
<br />''The others were all too afraid of dying.'' ''Hmph..we're gonna die anyway, if the jumphole isn't closed.'' 
<br />Some hours later, Mark was in his newly bought Falcon. He launched.
<br />''This is suicide'' he said to Gordon over the com channel.
<br />''Okay, Gordon, you lead Alpha wing, and you, Mark, you lead Gamma wing.'' 
<br />When they were about 5k away from the jumphole, they were ambushed by
<br />Bounty Hunters. Boom! One of Mark's wingmen was gone... Gordon launched
<br />a torpedo, and shortly after, a Barracuda exploded.
<br />''I've got two ships on my ta...voosh'' Mark heard, and then another wingman was gone.
<br />''Mark, you must go close the jumphole on your own!'' ''I'll keep them at bay!'' 
<br />It was Gordon. ''But..''Mark said, but Gordon shouted: ''Go, now!'' 
<br />Mark activated his cruise engines, and luckily enough, none of the Barracudas
<br />seemed to notice it...
<br />When he got to the jumphole, nobody was there. No Bounty Hunters, no Battleships. Strange...Mark thought. He activated the Jump Hole disruptor
<br />Lutenham gave all his wingman and him. ''Jump Hole will be deactivated in 30, 29, 28... Suddenly, he heard his neural net making noise:''Enemy Contacts!''
<br />The Bounty Hunters. They were the same ones as before...but that
<br />would mean...that Gordon didn't survive... ''Nooooooooo''Mark cried.
<br />He was very mad at the Bounty Hunters. He launched 2 missiles at one of them.
<br />Zoooooooofff... ''Yeah, one bit*h down two to go'' Mark shouted. 
<br />He dropped 5 mines, and one of the Barracudas exploded...
<br />Then his neural net made noise, again:Incoming Torpedo! 
<br />Mark turned his ship around, shooted a the torpedo with his Gaia's Saviours and
<br />Boom!...a heavy shockwave emerged from the explosion. The last Barracuda
<br />got caught in the shock wave, and was destroyed.
<br />7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0... Jumphole closed, he heard. His mission was complete...
<br />He could return to Jutland, but first, he flew to the spot were Gordon
<br />should have died. Then , all of a sudden, he saw an escape pod floating trough space... It was Gordon! He tractored it and set course to Jutland. 
<br />''Another adventure with Gordon''Mark laughed.
<br />They were now, officialy heroes of the Gaians! It was time for a party!
