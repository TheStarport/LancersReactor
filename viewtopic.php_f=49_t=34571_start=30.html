<br />Indy - &quot;Hackneyed&quot; is appropriate in that it is the sort of trite plots that appear in soap operas. However perhaps you have a point. I'm open to suggestions <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.

			<div class="content">@Esq,
<br />
<br />I guess my response was based on the fact that this is your personal story, a true one.  Nothing was contrived nor cliche.  And from a subjective standpoint, it is nowhere near being a trivial matter so I don't know that I would call it trite either.  Still and all, it is your story so it is your call.
<br />
<br />Today marks the 3rd anniversary of 9/11 and I am finally able to put down a few thoughts about  my personal experience in writing so I thought I would do so here.
<br />
<br />My organization had offices in the North Tower.  In fact, the floors that were in the immediate path of the first plane's impact were occupied by many of my working colleagues.   I knew of many, I actually knew far fewer.
<br />
<br />My offices are located directly north of the Towers in MidTown.  My office floor was high enough so that I had a clear view of what happened, although from quite a distance.
<br />
<br />I have many vivid recollections of what I saw that day but I thought I would share a smaller story about what I experienced after the fact when I volunteered to do my bit in the aftermath.  No.  I did not go down to the site to dig people out.  Because of the castualties that my company took, I volunteered to help at the Armory, which was close to my home, where news of those who were lost or missing was taken in and where information on those who may have been found was posted.
<br />
<br />And, in fact, it involves Elizabeth Taylor, of all people.  Ms. Taylor had been visiting the City and had been set to leave on Sept. 12.  Needless to say, all flights to and from were cancelled for something like another 4 days.
<br />
<br />She not being one who likes to sit around, decided to make calls at all of the places where relief work was being conducted.
<br />
<br />I must admit that this was a side of her that I had not thought existed.  She showed up at the Armory one day, unannounced and only with a young associate at her elbow.  She looked worn out but she had her &quot;public&quot; face on and she walked around and talked to the relatives who were milling around, hugged people, shook hands, really took some time to share in the fear and grief.
<br />
<br />By the time she was preparing to leave, maybe an hour later, maybe more, I had begun to let go of my own emotions which I'd kept locked up inside.  I don't know why but as she was exiting, I started to cry.  She looked at me as she passed and gave me a small smile and said &quot;I know.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Thing is, I really think she did know.  Anyway, that's one of the things I remember on these anniversaries.
<br />

			<div class="content">just to slightly amplify Ed's post; his firm had 7 floors of the North Tower and 6 of those floors were in the direct impact zone. 
<br />
<br />for most people, thankfully, such traumatic events are unlikely to inflict themselves directly on you; unlike our parents and grandparents, who grew up expecting to be sent off to fight, our post-war generation has never really experienced death up-close and en-masse
<br />
<br />Can we move this thread to the new forum please, i think it might be better off there?
<br />
<br />edit - thx whoever moved it (i know it wasn't Mustang cos he's asleep and never does anything for me anyway since I captured his wombats)

			<div class="content">it takes a lot of courage to do what indy did but on that day everyone would have wanted to do their bit to help out no matter how small. I heard in my Religious Education class about the first plane hitting the tower and got home from school in time to see the second hit and to see the second tower collapse. It was awful watching that from thousands of miles away but to have seen it first hand must have been indescribable.

<br />@Bret and GP.
<br />
<br />Thanks.
<br />
<br />What I learned from those days is that there is something inside you that can make you do things that you ordinarily wouldn't or that had you been asked to predict what you would do under the circumstances, you would not have considered.  If that is being brave, so be it.  But in truth, and selfishly, I NEEDED to do something.  I wasn't able to sleep much and there was a tremendous rage inside me that I had to channel somehow in a good way.
<br />
<br />It's all too true what Taw referred to.  We haven't experienced utter devastation and the killing of large numbers of people very much over here (although we've had a few recent tragedies all the same).  Thank God for that.  But my wife and I got a taste of what it is like in all of its reality aspects.  Sight, sound and smell.  Except that it only happened in one day and there were no further attacks unlike elsewhere in this world.
<br />
<br />It is a terrible thing.  When I see pictures of explosions and shell shocked buildings, of people looking dazed or delirious or of mourning and grief for the bloddy loss of a loved one, I am reminded of 9/11.
<br />
<br />We all really do need to find a way to put an end to this type of thing.  Here's hoping that we do.
<br />
