			<div class="content">In another thread Chetnik noticed that I have been very silent lately and I feel that I need to clarify that to you all. It&#180;s something that&#180;s been bothering me and I&#180;m wondering if it&#180;s just me or that others are feeling this too (staff/veterans).
<br />
<br />I have been keeping silent because things have changed here at TLR. Some regulars have disappeared, the beautiful, endless discussions about the back then upcoming game Freelancer have gone into oblivion and those discussions made way for again endless, yet this time useless discussions of people bitching and moaning about what Freelancer should have been instead of giving credit to DA for the great game they DID make and the possibilities it still has with mods and such. Nowadays the FL discussion largely exists of profound spamming, plain rudeness from time to time, meaningless discussions about (for example) whether Trent is gay or not (oh come on !) etc. Even in the OT things have changed somehow. I know that everything is destined for change and that change is inevitable, but sometimes it makes me sad that the good things as they once were will never return again in the way you want it to be. I&#180;m even getting the impression that the TLR staff has lost its edge to some extent and have grown tired of the war they have been fighting against those who keep undermining their authority and keep trying to break every single rule and regulation TLR has.
<br />
<br />I could be wrong about the TLR staff or the general impression I have about the forums (especially the FL discussion), I could be wrong about everything, who knows. Please tell me if I&#180;m getting the wrong picture here. 
<br />
<br />You know what...perhaps it&#180;s just me who has lost the edge...

			<div class="content">ppl change w/ their time..thats the most handy/useless advice i have right now, after playing 2 hrs straight badminton. i'm still new around here.. maybe some of you don't htink that but still. i'm new compared to other forums i've been to. but since freelancer is out, and not everyone can mod, i'd say a few, whom shall remain unnamed, have stuff to say.

<br />Science is knowledge.
<br />Knowledge is power.
<br />Time is money.
<br />power = work/time
<br />therefore, knowledge= work/money
<br />therefore, money = work/knowledge
<br />therefore, money is inversely proportional to knowledge.
<br />
<br />therefore,
<br />
<br />The <i>more </i> knowledge you have, the <i>less </i> money you have.

			<div class="content">Indeed, Eraser.   These days the OT forum is just full of pictures of space and jokes.  :\  Only the occasional good thread grabs me.  I guess this is the way things are supposed to be.  It's the way a game fansite matures once that game is released.
<br />
<br />I guess it can be tiring to have to read every thread out there now since so much is being posted.  So, for me, I really just browse thru the thread topics.  When FL was released, TLR got above 21K of unique visitors a day...now its floating around 18K a day.  There's just so many new people now that its hard to get to know one another now....and especially when some of the relatively new posters here dont particularily seem like the ones i'd like to get to know.
<br />
<br />Ah well, Eraser, you seem like you're on here all the time, man!  I commend you for that.  Good job. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Would you like a mod position?  LOL.  Would prolly do the forum a lot of good actually.

			<div class="content">A mod position EB ? Me ? Who says I would do that job any good ? I have much respect for you guys moderating this site, because it&#180;s certainly not a walk in the park. If Bargib would offer me a mod position I would certainly consider it, but I think there are some others that would deserve it more than me. I mean...what have I done for TLR that&#180;s worth mentioning, besides my presence here ?

			<div class="content">Hehe, Eraser, you're really an incarnation of modesty itself<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I've not been in FL discussion lately, since I don't have the game yet (as a matter of fact, I'm not sure I'm supposed to be answering your post, since I'm neither a veteran, nor a member of the staff, but nevermind, I'm drunk today and tend to express my opinion whether it's asked or not<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), but my impression of OT (I visit SL forums too, but they're more or less dead now - pity<img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) is that it's turned into a kindergarten - I'm not speaking of the age of the posters, but the character of discussions. The majority of threads either repeat themselves or become OT (sometimes multiple) in OT, or even flame wars. I guess it's just too many ppl here. On the other hand, it shows that TLR is popular, but hell I miss those days FL was not out yet and there were only a bunch of guys who knew how to behave. Sometimes I even consider stopping frequenting TLR, but I just can't help myself. It's a great site, I sincerely hope that with time it will again become a respected and friendly community it used to be. As to the staff, I really understand it's tough to control everything considering the amount of posts and posters, as well as the fact that they also have other duties apart from TLR. Some ppl really deserve banning, but it's not an easy action to take, not to mention the raise of inevitable animosity that would follow. 
<br />geez, I'm talking too much - it's always like that when I'm too drunk<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /> I don't have a drinking problem. I drink. I get drunk. I fall down. No problem.

			<div class="content">@Eraser: I always thought that there is no real objective (unbiased) truth... So the world around you is what you make of it. If you want TLR to become boring, monotonus and pointless, than nothing can stop that (for you). I, on the other hand, am having loads of fun here, because I want it to be so. (and because you guys are great) True, sometimes I blow a fuse or two, but that's because someone really did ther homework... (like jessy/lord of *CENSORED*), but I don't let it spoil my fun. Final verdict: Brighten up! TLR is a great place to be, and people here (the ones that reckognize me) are perfect... Don't be afraid of/upset by some (minor) changes, because it all tends to go back to normal, and not get even more out of control as you may feel... Just sit back, relax, enjoy the show, and let the newcomers someday speak of you as higly as you do about &quot;current&quot; veterans... I know I will.

<br />Anyway there is something wrong here. I remember couple of months ago your questions and your post would be answered in couple of minutes. I am still in OT whole day but it seems that there are times when there is nobody else, only me. Sometimes OT feels like<a href='http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/05/images/1026_ghostown.jpg' Target=_Blank> this</a> or like <a href='http://www.counton.org/numberland/14/desert.jpg' Target=_Blank>this</a>.

			<div class="content">Eraser, I wouldn't let it bother you too much. I suspect there are plenty of characters around who will play the game and remain for the duration for which they play the game before moving on and leaving. I think that given a few months, TLR will probably quieten down, those who make arses out of themselves will have left out of boredom and it'll be back to normal albeit with new additions to the cast (including me <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />@leonhart if you want immediate answers and a quicker correspondance, may I suggest you use the chat? Its nice n friendly if you are a n00b to IRC (like me) too.

			<div class="content">I totally agree with you Eraser, TLR has changed since FL's release. But what else could we expect? First their were like 15 regulars and some less active (but very intelligent) posters.
<br />
<br />What do we have know? We all know that. Just come to the forum after a day of not visiting. You're voerwhelmed with new topics (most of them are useless). Sometimes I feel the need the close most of them mainly because there are so many. All we regulars can do is to make sure the forums are active even when the newbies leave or quiet down.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another weird point, since FL's release, it seems that alot of spammers have been visiting TLR. Soemthing that didn't really happen before. Can these two things be related to eachother?

			<div class="content">i dont go anywhere but OT, in most forums actually, even the one i run. eventually its not about discussing a game, i havent got anything to discuss, it was brilliant. the only changing part of the site which covers new things is the OT section.
<br />
<br />shame your not enjoying it. theres a few things which piss me off though, and since were airing our thoughts:
<br />* Threads that start with a link and then THATS IT! - C'mon guys a link to something you think is funny and then a small 1 line comment like &quot;this is nuts&quot; is not a good thread. i DONT wanna go look at that on that recomendation alone. write something, your opinion about it whatever. if its pissed you off in some way or made you piss yurself laughing, then great, tell me about it so i know how you stand. I look at threads i wanna take part in and if something has moved you i'll take a look, if not, forget it, i can just type in a random word on google for mediocre weblinks.
<br />
<br />* Sigs longer than your post - pic sigs are ok, fair enough (EB does it have to be so damn big though?) but when people write out a thesis on time travel or the lyrics to a song or something as a sig, and then post a one line reply. thats f**king stupid, cut down on my scrolling action plz, if it takes more than a second to read it, delete it, cause i dont give a crap what your saying in a sig
<br />
<br />* joke threads - ok, we all like a laugh, i'm awful with jokes though. i can make one liners, i can come up with a situation thats funny, but i dont need pages and pages of jokes thrust down my gullet every time i log in. Ok so thats an exaduration, but c'mon, youve seen a page with bunch of jokes on and you think &quot;ooh, i'll share this with the guys&quot; then post every joke you can find. this is one of those moments where a link to the page would actually be a good idea, that way i dont have to scroll for 10 minutes to get through a page of posts which are just coppied and pasted from the site. Kimk, i'm talking to YOU with THAT post of universities and diseases that could quite possibly be the source of all the worlds suffering.
<br />
<br />* girls who are boys and boys who like girls - ok, so theres like 2 girls in the TLR world, all other girls are guys and i'm not even sure about the 2. thing is though, when a 'girl' speaks, be it here on irc, you big soft lads should stop turning all gooey eyed.

Anyways, i'm  just going with the flow hehehe.

			<div class="content">Allow me to cast off my Mod clicker for a moment, and allow me to speak freely <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I agree much with what has been said. I hate to be some elitist asshole or whatever, but I've noticed a big downward trend in the quality of discussion on TLR as well. In the FL forum it's all like &quot;Omg Juni's ass is sooo cute!1&quot; and stuff... A huge change from the heated debates on whether the neuronet was a viable interface or what Atticus Rockford, a frickin' general, was doing on the dark side of Pluto (one of my all-time favorite discussions, and one that has a premises most people here might not even get) and so on. In the OT forum, there were people discussing life issues, odd events that happen, asking advice, commenting on general happenings around the world, etc. Now it's like jokes, those frickin' political threads that won't die, and whether cheerleaders are HAWT11.
<br />
<br />Forgive me, because I'm sounding like a huge jackass right now I'm sure, and I'm not judging the newcomers since February/March, nor the people who post specific threads like I've mentioned. It's simply the deteriorating state of the online gaming community, I believe. Distantly related to the degredation of society <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I mean, I've played Starcraft games on battle.net and in maps where all the players cooperate vs. CPUs even, where you wouldn't win by killing your teammates, fights will break out of the STUPIDEST thing and they will generate huge tempers that nothing can cool, and they'll unally and kill the other person and ruin the game for all the other players. Thats not the only example by far. It happens all over the gaming world. Pointless namecalling and bickering (YOU'RE THE NEWB! NO YUO ARE! YOUR MOM!!!) are rampant, general immaturity makes me think that there is a law that prevents people over the age of 18 from using the internet, and frankly there are precious few &quot;refuges&quot; from this type of thing. TLR used to be one of them. It was someplace I could come every day, and it was a lot more personal. Now it's like a standard internet forum. Dozens of people I don't know, and frankly probably wouldn't even care to know. Just standard intarweb users who listen to NIN and Eminem and play Counter-Strike who found FL on the counter at EB and decided to give it a try. There are millions of people on the internet just like that, and don't seem unique.

			<div class="content">The people that were different seem largely gone, and with them my motivation for coming here. People like Shlozza, Kumari, Beef, Doyler, JallyJalla, MinisterPhobia (<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), Rheinland Destroyer, Bhurak Starkiller, and more. Don't get me wrong, forums survive because of new members joining and making themselves a part of the community (I don't believe TLR is exclusive. I remember the days a lot of those listed above joined). But there has been like this huge flood (even larger than I anticipated) of people that don't really post anything thought provoking, and it seems like it has driven out a lot of people who used to provide that. I used to feel a need  to come, to see what was going on with other people. But now I force myself to come, yet I can barely manage to come once every couple of days. It shouldn't be like that <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> This may be partly responsible for why I don't really know many of the people on TLR anymore. Anyway, it's like last night. Though not really connected, I feel it has some similiarities. I was in #freelancer last night on irc.portalive and it got so insane I just had to leave. It was like being in a room with a bunch of children. People were talking about cheating in multiplayer games just to piss people off, for example. I have to ask myself, do I really want to surround myself with people like this? If I want to be around people like that, I can easily go to any mediocre gaming website without any unique content or people.
<br />
<br />I think I need to stop, because I've kind of let a bit too much of myself out (though it did feel good <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) and I've probably made my point, if I had one. I also want to apologize if I've offended anybody, and I really  don't want to be an elitist jackass, though I've probably come off like one. It's just TLR has changed a lot, and not, IMO, for the better. It doesn't really help that FL doesn't have the longevity or complexity I was hoping for. It's like a double blow, you know? Two years, and this... Don't get me wrong, I love FL, and I think DA has done a great job, but if you take a look at what the game was supposed to be two years ago, it fell short somewhat. I don't think it's something to whine and bitch about constantly, though. So I'm sucking it up, playing other games and hoping for FL2 to be made become everything FL was supposed to be plus more <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Because frankly there are very few games that matches the depth of the universe FL has even now, which is maybe only partial what it would have been. Anyway, I intend to stay and hope TLR gets stable and become a community, rather than seemingly random people speaking to each other.
<br />
<br />Oh look, another gigantic post from me about nothing <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
