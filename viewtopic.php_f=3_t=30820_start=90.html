<br />On other comments tempted to say regarding computers that wouldnt be able to handle such battles.. I will simply politely bite my tongue.

			<div class="content">well here is my 2 cents
<br />
<br />more basic stuff (ships,weps,etc.)
<br />lvl of goods and special goods(i think a consumer goods made by a citizen sells more for a consumer goods made by a criminal locked up in a prism)
<br />and special type of goods (Rhineland green side arms? GMG rapid gun?)
<br />speial type goods sell more at soem bases and less (maybe ppl want refire not dam)
<br />auto turret but less accuret if u hired a polit (xeprt a cheap rookie)
<br />thta brings to diff lvl of hireing and u can train him/her
<br />auto goto for some ships and auto polit ment it will try to dodge or fighjt for u but at at wayyyyyyyy less effectioncy
<br />no planet crusieing this is a SPEACE sim
<br />3d mapping
<br />shows the price goes up and down(it does in fl too but not showing it try it run a same routee with a dormanty and u see the profit go down)
<br />make it really FREElancer so that even if u failed a missiosn in SP alnternive thing can come up (example u can fail to recort profressor quanitan and he dies and u have to get to a remote system to retrive a special potion that will bring him back to life (sad i no but the best i can do now)
<br />in MP u can help a faction gain ground (the political map will gain and lose accordinly)
<br />u can take cardmine and food and stuff just not required (unless addictided) to boost certain aspect of things (like u being more hyperactive and to be in on little secreats cuz ur addicted like them)
<br />u can buy diff ships from shipdealers other than the ones that are listed (maybe some old ship or a ship that was confestaded during a corsair raid but only at 1 at a time so only u can get it and it will be gone the next time u dock)
<br />u can tweak ur ship with special stuff so it will perform better for  a limited time and/or damage to ur ship
<br />have news notice your movements so u can see liek a headline (name) has shipped us a well needed supplies of h-fuel and it have relived our h-fuel shortage and on behalf of (so and so) we thank you and stuff like that
<br />char customization for MP
<br />
<br />
<br />i got more but i need sleep <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and as u can see my spelling is NOT perfect.....</div>

<br />
<br />&quot;be able to do things on land as well in space&quot;
<br />
<br />i want to be able to walk around the bar myself and talk to people by walking up to them not clicking on them.
<br />
<br />in real life would you click on someone to speak to them?
<br />
<br />bring back hyperspace and make the systems &quot;real&quot; scale.
<br />
<br />have things like:
<br />1) if you save someone from a 1v4 battle they could thank you.
<br />2) you can call for help from nearby allies.
<br />3) you can demand that AI's drop their cargo (very annoying for me)
<br />4) maybe make it so that you can upgrade your cargo hold for money.
<br />5) or upgrade your weapon/energy capabilities.
<br />6)if you blow up maybe you could be picked up in your 'escape pod' and start again somewhere else with your ship repaired.(instead of reloading)
<br />7) (addon to NO.6) if your in mission with juni or the person your working for in SP campaign you they pick you up and go back to the planet/base you started the mission at.
<br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> price drops/rises for economy.
<br />9) have convoys of battleships sometimes.
<br />10) make the campaign longer.
<br />11) have more than 38 levels.
<br />12) have moving wrecks.
<br />13) make more &quot;contraband&quot; for those that like being pirates.
<br />14) moving fields (dust/debris)
<br />15) more wrecks.
<br />16) have the ability to join factions.
<br />17) have more wars between factions.
<br />18) less sympathy for attacking factions.
<br />19) ability to destroy storage pods on stations.
<br />20) more 'faction' ships.
<br />21) more freighters.
<br />22) all ships that are in the files (CSV) made buyable.
<br />23) buyable train with 'pods&quot; that fill up.
<br />24) more realistic EGG worlds.
<br />25) more 'order' or equivalant missions in campaign.</div>

			<div class="content">Zack Lyons,
<br />
<br />   Well my computer wouldnt be one of those, either of them. My Pentium 3 800mhz and my Pentium 4 2.8ghz run the whole game seamlessly. 
<br />
<br />  I would really be disappointed if a game developer limited their product to make only the use of yesterdays Technology. Frankly it wouldnt make allot of sense if you really think about it. 
<br />
<br />  I can understand and relate the the problem of having an obsolete computer, but I solved that problem by purchasing a new one.  Now, before you call me money bags, I did alot of cutting corners to get my computer. I used my old computers monitor, speakers, etc. So ALL I bought was the Tower.  Only ran me $800 USD.
<br />
<br />  I just feel it's a little unreasonable to say &quot;Dont make this game bigger or more complex because my computer cant handle it&quot;.  Just my honest opinion.  If you're computer has trouble with that last battle in FL1, trust me, you may want to invest in a new computer anyway. No offense intended.

			<h3><a href="#p307790" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Here is my dream space game.  I hope that someday someone would develop it whether that is FL2 or another game.
<br />
<br />3D space (not domed 2d circles)
<br />
<br />be able to establish a home base
<br />be able to build defense turrets, towers, etc ( and upgrade them)
<br />be able to have multiple bases
<br />buy multiple ships
<br />tow empty ship to base
<br />stow locker at home bases (ammunition, fuel, batteries)
<br />repair droid aboard ship
<br />repair droids at bases ( repair or scrap salvage items)
<br />make repair droids upgradeable
<br />factions (create new or join) with NPC factions that rise and fall in populations (as they make kills their population increases and visa versa)
<br />
<br />Negotitations with factions (protection money, truces, cooperative goals, smuggling, etc)
<br />
<br />Only be able to fly ships from the faction you belong to.
<br />
<br />Alien artifacts.
<br />
<br />No story mode ( all dynamic and continuous events, catastrophes, wars, plagues, etc)
<br />
<br />Newtonion physics in space then be able to open airfoils at a reduced speed and drop into a planets atmosphere with gravity, drag, and normal plane handling.
<br />(Would love to see a squadron of enemy fighters break through a planets atmosphere in pursuit or chase a bounty hunter into a planets atmosphere and find his home base to capture)
<br />
<br />Mission boards should run missions whether or not someone took the job.  Want to be able to snoop on a hostile base or corporation mission board, see what actions are being planned and intercept. (Would like to enter a hostile planets atmosphere, land within so far from a city and tap into their communications: even leave a spy probe to continue getting data until it was found and destroyed).
<br />
<br />Have a way to gain experience points like a RPG game.  LevelUp and use points to increase your reflexes (ship responds faster), intelligence ( could be used to increase snooping range, repair speed, language knowledge of different factions, etc), charm ( better prices).  As you level up the AI should level up and all AI pilots get better skills with better ships, weapons, etc.  If a story line is included then at the end of the story line, (even if a maximum level has been reached) the AI pilots should continue to level increase, quantity increase, etc. until at an insane level.
<br />Make difficulty settings based on starting AI  pilot levels only (e.g. easy-AI pilots one level below you, normal-AI pilots even with you, hard- AI pilots one level above you, real hard- AI pilots two levels above you: really, real hard- three levels, insane- pick a level above three)
<br />
<br />Mostly, I would like a game that is different with each restart.  Planets, jumpholes, faction positions, etc. all new and having to explore the new restart for my intelligence gathering.
<br />
<br />I'm not much on MP play because of slow internet connection and not enough time to play for several hours at a time but for the MP players if there were game settings for winning (e.g. last one standing, highest level after 10 days, top 3 dogfight duel w/winner take all, etc) with game announced resets, I believe the MP game would keep growing and continually attract new players.
<br />
<br />Have bank account (individual or faction)
<br />Comm frequencies that can be set by each faction to communicate with each other.
<br />
<br />AND if I get shot down, I loose my ship, cargo, money that I'm carrying, etc and restart with a basic starter ship ( bank account money, base inventories, etc would remain for me to use unless that base is captured by someone else).
<br />
<br />This is my dream space game.  I wish someone would develop it.</div>

			<div class="content">well maby things happen like the guy at the top says (wars pleges etc)  would be cool. maby be able to pay npcs to fight with u. if u hire a fac like liberty rouges that might run but like the coursars would never run.  be able to walk around on the bases and plaints. a couston ship thing were u use a simple 3d modler like g-max to make a ship of your dreams. the body costs like 1000 and things like wepen moutes coust this much depending on lvl. have the ability to add mouts later if u what or even hulls. just emagen what people could to with the feater. haveing the ability to make a facson that kills your enamys and helps your allis would be cool. i have whated to buy or make my own base sencs i beat the sp game. (would be cool for mp 2) just think of the posabiltys. u could have a faction at a base u made and have people like your frends in your faction defending your base and getting pad from it for jobs u post. u could hire npc people to get money buy trading rading or doing jobs for other people. u could have turf wars and just war with other clans. clans could have there own factoin. any one that joins your group that u what in your group join join the faction. put the costom ship thing with the base thing and make your own ships for the faction. maby u could clam territory. (think of the posibiltys) maby a costom gun maker 2.
<br />
<br />
<br />put this sanarieo in your head.
<br />
<br />u make a base in a nebula with lots of water. then water would be cheep there but gold or other metles would be vary rare. u could send npc's to kill for the meatle or trade with other factions that need water. then u have  some frends that join your group. by joining the group thay join the faction and have all the same enamys ans allies. with your frends the faction gets richer. u then hire more npc's to get more money. thay will deposit x amount for every thing they do. like 100000 for a good run at a trade lane. u and the other people could get only there share.(u have 1000000000 in the accout and u have 2 people in the group(not incuding npc) it devides by 2.) ok u have a rich faction and u decide to make some costom ships. u make some cool ships and put them for sale on your base. u tell your frends to buy the ships to fit in. all the npc players buy what ever ship u tell them to buy. (think of the abilty to see there accouts there money and tell them what ship and guns to get.) now u have a cool faction and think well i have a lot of money and nothing to do with it sow u buy some wepen platforms and put cool guns on them. (or use rocks in a astrode field.) and u think agen lets go to war. u decide to go to war with bobs clan/faction. (u can change any factions rep with u to lower and set it to war making all the npc and players in the group that way to.) when u declare war he knows what u did and is the same way. (no u can rts things now. send npc to this place or rade this line to kill his econmy.) now bob is frends with a navy (liberty britoniea etc) and thay halp him. u lose and u have some restricsons. (like no more then 20 npc or no ships other then lf stuff like that.) they demand u pay 100000000000000 for the damges or that kill whats left. u pay and rebild what u can. now its been a year(time could pass that would be cool) and the treaty is over. u make more npc and decide to buy a battle ship.(or make your own think of it.) and sation it near your base. now that u have a battleship u need it to moore with your base after long missions so u buy a mooreing fixter. with the mooreing fix u can now buy bigger transports. u make your team better and u buy some more bases that u put in other nebles and rock fields. and u buy more battleships. (maby gunbouts firets and crusers to) u have a big army now. u declare war agen but this time on some team that controls a systom u what. he has no allies. but he hires some outcasts to help him fight u. but in the end u win. now all the land he had is yours. any bases that surenderd are yours. (maby u can have people bourd ther bases and big ships.) u have your own systom now. u put a jump gate to some other systom in and some trade lanes. u make a fort and colinize a plaint. 
<br />
<br />sound cool think of playing the game.</div>

			<div class="content">one more thing in sp  have the abilty to pick what u are. (pirit trader etc) all the groups have a story like a trader would be hired buy a company that is going bankrupt anu u have to do some unlawful thinks hehe.
<br />
<br />mp have the abilty to make logos and ranking. (srry got that from some one in this trede.) costom paint jobs. (think need for speed underground.) but make your own vynals and decles.(clan logos wink wink or signters) maby some systoms just for mp that war could be in and could be clamed by clans or factions. maby co op for the story. a story for mp could be cool.
<br />
<br />all modes.  maby buy a plate for for a ship that has this power core and this many mounts. u could have a lf platfor that is small but the hf and vhf would hace bigger ones.  more pre buildt ships and more stuff to explore. got theas from other people to but ships that could be damaged in ways to hinder your combat. wing gets blown off less munuverabilty cockpit shot u dead. like steel battaleon u have to eject to stay alive u dont and u have to make a new person. u do and u try to get rescued. (if u are frends with a facton near by they will look for u.) in mp u could chat for help but that could ask for money. then u start with no ship were ever they put u. have some missions avalible foe new ships. get drunk and have blury vision like the nitris in nfsu. get sick and there will be a delay in the controls. (u move the mouse and a sec later it moves. pant kills on the side of the ship or get a tatoo of the kills on your body. (tatoos clan logos.) have a sims like make a player. make your own pilot wight black mail femail u chouse. tatoos and other markings like sacres. hare color fatness or skiny ness. tall sort and pick the closes u were. make your own. (make a shirt with clan logos or what ever.) and for the walking around be able to buy guns. (pistol assalt rifles sniper rifles etc) more for ships have chips u can buy for the comuter on the ship. like a chip for zoom to see a battle from a safe disstens. better chat.( to add voice chat to mp) better sensors etc. but make it so u can only put so many. maby inplants for the polit u made. like vision or runing speed.

			<div class="content">I know a Freelancer 2 where you could run around on planets and have huge faction wars would be really fun, but if you did all that stuff, it would a) be to huge and confusing, and b) it would just not be the Freelancer that we know and love anymore, it would be a different game!  I really don't want to see huge changes in FL2 because Freelancer was such a great game and I don't see how it could be improved on that much.  A new story, new ships, and some new areas to explore would be great.  (Some of you guys had really creative storyline ideas!)  I have enjoyed many, many hours of playing this game and I still play it often.  I know that a sequel may be wishful thinking, but at least we have some really great mod makers here at Lancer's Reactor that still make the game interesting!
<br />Well, just my opinion.  Take it or leave it.

			<div class="content">Here are some of the idees I thoughts I got  while reading the idees allready posted in.. 
<br />
<br />- Maybe you could get more/less money, depending on how much time it took and your actions during the mission (Damage status)
<br />
<br />- It would be amazing (probobly therefore no chance the makers would make it happen) but if they somehow you could control your character while on ground.. running in the streets searching for missions, maybe in the slums depending on you rumour and status with the &quot;bad guys&quot; getting missions from them to even on a Police controlled planet (where the are good guys there are bad guys). Staying in hotels over night or maybe a house you bought earlyer.. 
<br />  Metting up with hotshots from big companies discussing contracts (all contracts doesn't have to be about money, maybe speciell weapons or information?)
<br />
<br />  I was thinking you know the intro to Freelancer has no purpose to the game itself. I may be retarded but shouldn't Freelancer 2 have connections to that maybe that Trent finds a wormhole that brings him back to the lands of Coalition. Or if you made a custom character maybe it could be the other way that you begin on the Coalitions side and find the wormhole the Allians escaped through during some mission you hade from before.. These are some of my crazy idees i fought of.. 
<br />  But anyway I think they should skip the thought of Nomads, no offence i liked the game very much and it was very fun playing but that sucked..
<br />
<br />Well that would be all, plz write in what you guys think of what the comming story should be about.. 
<br />Have a good day

			<div class="content">I have some ideas so bear with me if I repeat some, as I just skimmed through the last 2 pages of posts :/
<br />
<br />New ships and ship types (goes without saying)
<br />---Stealth Ships. Ships that you can physically see but doesn't show up on radar (not to be confused with cloaking ships like nomad ships.
<br />
<br />Refrigeration units for ships (like an addon to your ship) - to help preserve perishables during long journeys. It would take up cargo space in itself, but it may or may not be enough to cut into profits.
<br />
<br />
<br />Larger systems (again goes without saying) 
<br />More bases on planets (like Having bases for Bounty Hunters, Police, Navy, etc. on Manhattan) blah. blah. blah.
<br />
<br />Usage of fuel cells (or H-fuel). Make a use for border stations in addition to replacing nanobots/shield batteries/ship repairs.
<br />
<br />House Hispania. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah.
<br />
<br />Kepler system is a bunch of reconstruction/debris/radiation fields due to storm that was supposed to pass through the system and wipe everything out.
<br />
<br />Omega 41 goes Supernova leaving behind debris and a black hole with gravitational fields. 
<br />
<br />Random News happens (ie, shiip hits asteriod and you go to find it and help with cleanup, guarding it while cleanup proceeds, or to just plunder it.)
<br />
<br />Make trade lanes hazerdous in asteriod fields and debris fields etc.
<br />
<br />Hidden bases - Bases that you can literally fly over and not notice unless you buy or obtain coordinates to it and clearance to land
<br />
<br />Economy that works - if everyone takes diamonds to New Tokyo, Diamonds IN New Tokyo would plummet, etc. etc. etc.
<br />
<br />Building your own ships (or at least supplying parts for it) High temp. alloy for hulls, gold for wiring, cobalt for glass and windshilelds, engine components for well....engines I guess. etc. If you've ever played Star Wars Galaxies (or know the crafting system) it would be kinda like that, you supply so many of each part and you can get a ship of X size only thing you would HAVE to put into it would be design (which could be a choice oh ships based on location, faction affiliation, etc,)</div>

			<div class="content">Here are my ideas. Mainly about hardware and Operating System.
<br />
<br />Freelancer should (hardware/OS):
<br />Be able to be compatible with Linux and Macintosh.
<br />Be compatible to new hardware in September 2004.
<br />(Maybe) Be compatible with XBOX.
<br />
<br />Freelancer should (gameplay):
<br />Better AIs.
<br />More storyline, like 10-15 years after you send the Nomads back home, the nomads come and try to destroy human being, full force (just like HALO).
<br />More houses come in late.. Like Canada, France, China.
<br />More stations.
<br />A Freelancer World Editor should be included in the game.
<br />
<br />P.S: House Ispania was destroyed. Therefore, no Spain!

			<div class="content">how bout a universe that increases in difficulty 
<br />
<br />as the player's experience increases. 
<br />or possibly as the net damage per second one's ship puts out increases 
<br />or the net worth of the player. 
<br />or all three?
<br />
<br />multiplayer games could take an average of all players experience and create a balanced universe.    
<br />
<br /> after mastering rheinland and everything, why go back to any other place unless your modded up the @#$%.  the game is not exciting or fun anymore when you have level 10 everything.  There could still be very difficult systems where you would easily be outmatched but they wouldn't be so over bearing that you would necessarily die in one good shot.
<br />
<br />one more thing,  
<br />
<br />just a plethora of gadjets for ships.
<br />scientific instruments like (but not limited to)
<br />     long range sensors,
<br />     cloak detectors,
<br />     mineral quality scanners for mining,
<br />     tacheon beams and such.
<br />or
<br />     cloaking/phasing device
<br />     holo-emitters
<br />     radar jammers
<br />     planet killing weapons - (team play - kinda like &quot;kill the other teams planet first&quot; or something)
<br />
<br />and damnit, have a frickin florida system so everyone will stop asking where it is.</div>
