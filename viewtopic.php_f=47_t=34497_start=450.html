			<div class="content">(ooc: Hold on... last time I checked, Jump Gate and Trade Lane technology was a secret known only to, at most, Ageira Technologies and Deep Space Engineering; how did Rheinland get ahold of it?)
<br />
<br />*At summit, CEO and President of Ageira Technologies, Samuel Regin, takes the podium.*
<br />
<br />First, I would like to make one important announcement: we do not intend to support either side in this war, and desire an end to the Axis-Alliance conflict. Our weapons and technology are to be granted to each side equally, in the interests of humanity in general. 
<br />
<br />There can be no doubt that the Hispanian colonists have just as much right to the title of House as the members of the Axis, and I will not hold their past crimes, driven out of need, against them. The Corsair attacks were caused by a desperate need for resources, and the Outcasts were only searching for a cure for their terrible infliction.
<br />
<br />I find it amusing that Rheinland would propose such an open trade agreement in the same meeting in which they not only advertise the theft of corporate secrets such as the Jump technology, but also advocate destroying a fundamental cornerstone of Sirius's society simply because we will not give you preferential treatment!
<br />
<br />In response to the Bounty Hunter's Guild's offer of alliance, I would like to comment that at last one of the Axis members has shown some sense. I accept the Guild's offer of relocation to New Greece, and in return would like to give them a sign of our friendship: when development of the new Hermes Cannon project is completed, they will receive the first working model, free of any charge.
<br />
<br />On the subject of the Hermes Cannon, it is my pleasure to announce that construction of Station Styx in the Cortez System is complete, and that refittings on Pueblo are now at 66%, with inertial stabilizer equipped and construction of actual engines begun. 
<br />
<br />In the end, I will have you all know that regardless of the outcome of the coming projects, Ageira will not be joining either the Axis or the Alliance. We are a corporation, not a government, and our role in society is to ensure the proper operation of the five Houses. You can drive us from your systems and lose our trust and assistance, but no matter what we will remain neutral in this conflict, and no Ageira craft will open fire on any Alliance or Axis ship.</div>

<br />
<br />My fellow axis members. Residents of Sirius.
<br />
<br />Need DOES NOT justify acts of murder and crime. If need would justify crimes, then we'd have to let every criminal who has killed someone or robbed someone because he &quot;needed&quot; something go. Would you like it?I doubt it.
<br />
<br />Now would NON-AXIS people leave.*guards escort non-axis reps out*
<br />Thank you. We have achieved many victories in this war, but with a great cost. We have taken Leeds, but with a loss of many brave men and women. We have managed to drive criminals out of Liberty(read about 10 pages back and you see that every criminal base in Liberty space has been wiped out) We cannot stop. We need to push the so-called &quot;House Hispania&quot; right where they came from!We need to aid Bretonia on this fight!We cannot give up, we must stand against our enemies united and strong, and we shall overcome them!&quot;
<br />
<br />*People cheer*
<br />Now, NON-AXIS people can be escorted back.
<br />Redmond steps out of the Podium.

<br />OOC:Outcast can you add Cortez to Liberty systems list. I annexed it which you'll see if you look few pages back.</div>

<br />
<br />Admiral Redmund, I must object to your blatant misunderstanding of my statement. You have, as it were, quoted me out of context. These people were seperated from us, forced to resort, in many cases, to CANNIBALISM just to survive. Perhaps we should have given them what they needed. The people of Hispania may have devolved into pirates and smugglers, but did any of the Houses try to help them? What they did was an act of desperation, and any of you would have done the same in their circumstances. I'm not asking that we let criminals go, I'm asking that we try to stop crushing those who might disagree with our policies.
<br />
<br />I do not support either crime or terrorism - I am radically against both. But when discussing the acts of such criminals, you have to remember that as governments they are YOUR failures, the people that you could not, or refused to, protect.
<br />
<br />As I said before, should you ostracize my people and the services they provide, I will not turn immediately to your enemy. I am going to support my own vision, of second chances and true equality in a capitalist society. I respect and agree with many of the Axis's policies, but in my eyes your current war against Hispania is one of the greatest hypocracies I have ever seen.</div>

<br />
<br />&quot;To agiera, Rhienland cannot depend on anyone but itself and the axis. we cannot allow you to be the only ones to create items that everyone needs, further more need does not give the right to murder. many Rhienlanders have died trying to rid space from the sum and i anounce now that no matter what Rhienland will fight the HA till the bitter end.&quot;
<br />
<br />*Axis citzens cheer*
<br />
<br />&quot;non axis reps please leave, thank you. Now the axis must advance in technology therefore i sujest that in the most secure system we have we open a base for all of the best axis scientiest to work as one group. this will further the axis in advancment!!!. non axis reps may return. Now this is Rhienlands generous offer to to the HA if you stop all artifacts anc cardimine trade, stop all the murdering and submit yourself to law we may consider not finishing your puny systems you calls houses. you call yourself a house but what house builds itself on murder and theft. after the 80-years war Rhienland was shattered. many men and women lay dead for both us and the GMG. Rhienland needed resources but we did not raid liberty or bretonia, we stuck with it and look at us now we founded the axis and produce huge amounts of resources and ship. we invented some of the most revoloutinary technologies today. we have done what no one has done before, and never has Rhienland had to steal and act like criminals and terrorists to get what we wanted and needed. further more the HA has never needed what they took. they made planetfall and could of farmed and prospured but instead they made a drug and got adicted or they dug up artifacts rather then to support themselves the way honest men and women do!&quot;</div>

<br />*Corsiar high elder Sanchez stands and adreses the crowed*
<br /> Well rienland where have you been we stoped all cardimine tradeing and burned all of the stuff several months ago.Also no artifacts have left hispania space since this waar began. So i think that you are just making excuses for your actions.
<br /> i thank all of you who do not attack us here it is people like you we needed when we were lost. Because then people might have bothered looking for us rather than making money. Remember we were xiled for generations and had no way to develop ways to get things for ourselves. If we needed materials we simply stole them becasue we did not know how to mine.
<br /> if you tell us not to hold you responsable for the actions you ancestors took against our sleeper ship, then we tell you not to hold our ancestors responsable for wanting vengance.
<br /> As i finish this speach i would like to point out to jusari that tau 29 is an hispanic system and will be defended from any attack. the last thing i have to say is that this meeting is a pointless, if we are not willing to share information with each other how can we ever hope for peace?
<br />*Leaves the room escorted by guards*
<br />Message to the HSF(Secur channel):
<br />Good the spy cam worked we have the information from the other delagates speaches from when we left the room. It is now being analised on new madrid</div>

			<div class="content">And some information NOT related to the conference:
<br />
<br />Relocation: Ageira Technologies is relocating its headquarters from Planet Manhattan to New Greece. While construction of our new headquarters at Marathon Station in the as-of-yet unnamed system discovered by the bounty hunters is underway, we will be operating out of Guild bases temporarily.
<br />
<br />Refitting of Pueblo Station has been completed. The station is now, for all intents and purposes, a ship and has been christened the ATS Destiny. She has been equipped with a prototype Hermes Cannon and is being moved to New Greece.
<br />
<br />A team of Ageira and Deep Space Engineering workers have been dispatched to New Greece to begun construction of the new Jump Gate.
<br />
<br />The deal with Planetform, Inc has been completed. Both our scientists are now working on the newly named &quot;Genesis Ray&quot; a device that, hopefully, will be capable of essentially &quot;spray-painting&quot; an earth-like terrain onto a planet. The Genesis Ray will revolutionize terraforming.
<br />
<br />Ageira Technologies respects the Bounty Hunters' Guild's right to the newly discovered system and would like to purchase the system from them. Once we control the new system (nicknamed &quot;New Israel&quot; by some more religious employees) we will be using it as base for our advancement into the future.
<br />
<br />Diplomacy:
<br />Allies: Deep Space Engineering, Planetform Inc.
<br />Friendly: Bounty Hunters' Guild, all other Liberty corporations
<br />Sympathy: House Hispania, House Bretonia
<br />Neutral: House Kusari, House Liberty, anyone not listed anywhere else
<br />Disagreement: House Rheinland
<br />Hostile: None
<br />Enemy: All &quot;criminals&quot; (this does not include the Zoners or the Farmers' Alliance or, of course, members of the Hispania Alliance or Hispania itself)
<br />
<br />Technology:
<br />Controls most Jump Gate/Trade Lane construction and maintenance.
<br />The &quot;Hermes Cannon&quot; a new capital ship weapon based on new Jump technology currently in the testing stage.
<br />The Mercury, a new star drive based on the same recent Jump innovations as the Hermes Cannon, currently in the testing stage.
<br />Controls Detroit Munitions (manufacturers of all infantry weapons except the &quot;Rheinland Special Rifle&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Bases and Ships:
<br />Styx Station (Low Stellar Orbit in the Cortez System)
<br />Detroit Munitions (near Manhattan in the New York System)
<br />Ageira Headquarters (on Planet Manhattan, currently being relocated)
<br />Ageira California (on Planet Los Angelas)
<br />Marathon Station (in the &quot;New Israel System&quot;, currently under construction)
<br />
<br />The ATS Destiny (refitted version of Pueblo Station, equipped with prototype Hermes Cannon and Mercury)
<br />75 Large Trains
<br />500 Startrackers</div>
