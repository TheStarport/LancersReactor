			<div class="content">Hey, before I start  ... I know your going to think this is one of those I can't mod so do it for me threads but it isnt, I am learning to mod Freelancer myself, learning the tools and ini coding etc, but progress on what I'm trying to achieve is moving along very slowly as I don't really know what I'm doing and am prone to errors. Having said that I get the basics of how to troubleshoot etc, just takes time. 
<br />
<br />I am enquiring if you any of you guys are currently taking on any modding projects? As I have one in mind &#8230; at the end of the day I would rather someone experienced take part to point out where I am going wrong, as I said I would like to help out in anyway possible with it myself, but as I have only just started learning I feel that with all the mistakes I make and could make will slow me down tremendously. 
<br />
<br />I know that mods do indeed take a while to build, I appreciate that. But if I personally do it on my own I won&#8217;t be finished until like a year or so.
<br />
<br />So my question is this, would any of you be willing to help me out? I will give you some basic information about it first and if you like the idea then the decision is yours to make, I will carry on with it regardless I just thought as you guys seem to obviously know what your doing (better than myself) you might appreciate the challenge lol.
<br />
<br />The mod I am planning is based loosely from an old 2D top-down mmorpg named Silent Death Online, in which you picked a house (faction) and battled it out with ships that you could upgrade once you had credits from enemy kills or mission objectives. But it was on a more basic level than Freelancer, so my hope is to strip Freelancer down a bit, not mod the existing content so much.
<br />
<br />The ideas I have had for this is that you start out with the basic ship, with money for a bribe, this bribe will gain you your faction status. Each faction will have 2 small systems with 1 acting as a go between and 1 as a homeworld system, and 1 central hub system that provides jumps to each of the other houses systems. 
<br />
<br />Once a player is killed players can loot the enemies&#8217; engines, shields and weapons and then sell them at their home systems to make their money (cargo is kept to keep what they have reaped so far, and weapons they had will still be there upon respawn.
<br />
<br />There will be several classes of ships, the fighters, which will comprise of re-designed ships based loosely from the old ships from Silent Death (I can send you these if you wish, they are in voxel format and can be viewed in 3D form)
<br />
<br />After you have bought the most powerful fighter you can move on to speciality ships such as bombers (one particular design springs to my mind, the Longsword from Halo, (I can provide a shot of that but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s not in 3D form) where there would be several missile hardpoints designed to take out defence installations, whereas fighters will be energy weapons only, so for a different experience players will be able to buy role based ships.
<br />
<br />There will be a cruiser (which I would love to be modelled after the sleeper ships from the intro), powerful weaponry but slow turning, fighter escorts to promote teamwork, so that bombers have less chance of destroying targets, these cruisers will carry powerful torpedo&#8217;s that hopefully can be shot to be destroyed by other missiles, but once they hit the target it is more or less crippled, if it were to hit a fighter in the middle of a battle that player would be instantly destroyed and any fighters in the vicinity caught in the wake will be damaged in a staggered fashion the further they are away from it.
<br />
<br />For the high level fighters cloaking will be available, which will drain power to the point where it goes offline and players have to wait several seconds for their power levels to return enough to maintain a stream of fire. The device will be expensive and only mountable on the best fighter, and once a player has died the ability will be gone (open to suggestion on how to balance it).
<br />
<br />These are some of my ideas, I&#8217;m sure you have your own as I do not yet fully understand what in the game is possible and what is not, so I&#8217;ll leave that assessment to the people who know more, for if you wish to have a go at it, if not then thanks for reading.
<br />
<br />As I said I would be happy to write content, give you the details on weapons and equipment the best I can from the original game, the ships, and help do some coding such as bases (which I am currently learning along with creating systems etc).
<br />
<br />Probably the most difficult thing in this mod is going to be the factions, as there will be 4 houses, each hating each other, so if possible I would like them to be red against each other or green depending on who&#8217;s targeted, obviously with they&#8217;re house name before they&#8217;re name as happens in the game. For example Navy &#8211; pwn4ge would become House Colos &#8211; pwn4ge, with their clan tag coming after the name, for example House Colos &#8211; pwn4ge +DC+ (Defenders of Colos, an old Silent Death clan). 
<br />
<br />Server rules and other information I would like to appear in the bar under News of the initial starting base, which is where you select your faction.
<br />
<br />There is also a question I&#8217;d like to ask, is it possible to have upon a players death the name mentioned of WHO killed them? Or at least some method of easily measuring the total deaths of a faction, this will be for events called Killfests that would be run should the mod be built.
<br />
<br />There will also be a hidden system whereby there is remnants of an old war, where there would be many wrecks, one of them containing super weapons, but the player must make it back through the deadly space to mount them, and if they are killed, those weapons need to be dropped so that others can pick it up and be tractored, however once mounted they are a class up from the heavy fighter, as the loot will include the weapons plus champion shield, that can only be gotten from the loot.
<br />
<br />I am hoping that the loot could be in a random wreck, but if not then I guess all that can be done is to make the wreck extremely difficult to get to, and with everyone fighting to get there first, it would be even more difficult to get back to their own system with it alive, so a mass battle ensues raging from that system to the hub system and into their home space, the getting of this loot will be an event.
<br />
<br />Well, I am sure you are bored now lol, so I&#8217;ll leave you be &#8230; the decision is yours <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />If you would like to help leave a msg here or contact me via email describing what you can do in my inbox (mwood_2k2 _at_ blueyonder.co.uk)
<br />
<br />Thanks again for reading (if you made it this far and didnt fall asleep lol)
