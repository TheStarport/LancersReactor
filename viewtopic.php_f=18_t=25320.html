<br />Sir Spectre setup a discussion thread in the Site Suggestions and Feedback Forum
<br />
<br />There hasn't been much comment but it is difficult to know whether it is because of the forum where the thread is housed or because no one really cares.
<br />
<br />So.... What do you say?  How about visiting the thread and just indicating a yes or no to the idea.  Or maybe you could post some suggestions or proposals of your own.  That would be even better!
<br />
<br />Thanks!

			<h3><a href="#p212066" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Erm - to what sort of end? You would probabily have people claiming little variations of stuff, also you will have poeple claiming lots of stuff because they have been here a while. It would turn into one hell of a pissing match, with someone needing to look back even further than Tachyons thread about making a large mod in February. That kind of blows poeples arguements about who thought of what and made what first............blah blah blah.
<br />
<br /> The idea about people posting here is a community, we share things. Notice that the ones who don't want to share, don't actually post here at all. They mod away from here. They keep their ideas to themselves - which is fair enough
<br />
<br /> Now - a community shares ideas, if we all started to get really protective due occurances and wild accusations by some, then we would stop sharing. We would do what others do, and work away from here. No-one would help others out with problems, etc etc. From that, Freelancer modding would slow......and then stop. No-one would share any ideas for the fear that it might get stolen and claimed by others.
<br /> No-one would share any other things, because it would take away from their mod - ie, their mod wouldn't be that special (which we all kinda ours will be great!).
<br />
<br /> All we need is more honesty, and more respect for each other. It has been shown that some hold great contempt for others. If we can be honest enough to just ASK if you wish to use someones idea, then we will all be fine. If they request a credit in the mod - then give it to them, if they say no you cannot use it, then don't. Nice and simple.
<br />
<br /> Even better as well - don't then try to take credit for things that aren't yours. What that means is that if someone asks to use something from your mod that wasn't yours either, then point them in the right direction. 
<br />
<br /> There are parts that depend soley on how far to go with the credits though - cos technically you will never actually produce your own mod. Just think - making new guns, mountable equipment etc etc. All of this you might actually work out how to do, but suddenly you will have to ask someone else to use it all. You might not have known about their mod ever, but then have it removed cos someone did it ages ago.
<br />Ah - but that is the point of a registry - so you can see these things. Well - lets put this into perspective.
<br />What new things are being done?
<br />Who is doing something totally original?
<br />
<br />Not guns - you will make your own, but someone did that first - they found out how to do it, so credit them
<br />Flyable ships - back to Febuary this year that one - so forget hoping about that, once one can be done, they all are done as it uses the same wording, so search back to Feb to find the FIRST person, as we are all using THEIR discovery to fly them
<br />Systems - well, there is a thread where someone describes it first, although its crude, but that is the one. cannot remember name (not giskard)
<br />Importing ships - not a clue - who did that first - they found out how to do it, so we should credit them.
<br />equipment - late feb, early march
<br />Beam Weapons? No idea - its Reynen -that means mid to late march i think he joined.
<br />Commodities? Back in Feb i think it was.
<br />NPC loadouts and regens stuff - think that was march or April - not sure
<br />capship encounters - Nephilim that one - April
<br />Capship handling - Wanderer
<br />Capship killing missions - Giskard
<br />Going faster than 300 - not sure
<br />Breaking 999 limit - not sure
<br />Holding more than 50 missiles -not sure
<br />
<br />You see the problem here? for anyone to claim something, you would have to thoroughy check first, then stuff that is treated like 'common knowledge' (like xerox photocopying) would suddenly have to be credited.
<br />(The common knowledge means that although Xerox found the method first(photocopying) i think, and patented it, anyone can use it for free as its almost like 'common knowledge' on how to do it. You with me there. Basically Xerox admitted how much it would benefit everyone, and didn't hold onto it themselves (this is also as other methods would have been developed which would have been better, and if they hadn't found it, there company would be stuc in the past! LOL)
<br />
<br />
<br />yes - it could be done, but if it is to be done, it should be done CORRECTLY - which means verifications back to Feb time to find out and ref to be sure on EVERYTHING!
<br />
<br /> Then someone has to check each mod to make sure, and technically - if you do the part where you have to credit someone else with the work, technically you should be able to 'lift' that from their work, as crediting them with work means why should you do it? Get my drift.
<br />
<br />man - long post - leaving it now before fingers drop off. I could have easily gone on for hours. 
<br />
<br />
<br />However, to sum up, everyones readme credits would be a page or two alone if you really wanted to do this correctly. Of course, you could do the bodged up version, where people start from now, or you just take what some poeple say as truth. Its alot of hassle though
<br />
<br />honesty and respect - that is all we need
<br />
<br />Ask for permission, credit in readme - that is the answer for the above.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Just what i was thinking about the idea, lets discuss. And for the record - this is not a claiming mods thread, its a discussion, so if you are thinking about posting a cliam here - sod off!

			<div class="content">Go for it then - give it a go, see what happens. If it is for stuff like ship meshes then fine, no probs with that. Like you summed up in a word.....lol - its only if it becomes <b>nittpicking </b>. Like if people start trying to claim ideas and so on, then a problem might arise and it descend into chaos and mayhem. As everyone knows - i don't mind if people use my ideas at all - heck, i show people how to do things if possible! LOL
<br />
<br />   As long as someone is watching over the place though it will be cool. However, i suggest that you get moderators harsh approval - to remove any spurious post as soon as possible (ie, spam). Anything that is not a register is taken out, or better yet, <b>two </b> threads created. One is <b>locked </b> by moderators, and the other isn't. ONe is for posting, and moderator can then copy the relevent posts to the otherthread to keep it easy to read and on track withotu becoming spammed up!</div>
