<br />A Story By: ww2jacob
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />	<b>Chapter One
<br />	Planet Earth, Sol System </b>
<br />
<br />	The bell rang.  Jack King slowly rose out of his desk.  First period English class was over, so that meant that it was time for second period.  Jack would have to walk a long walk to get to there; the science hall was across the football field.  It promised to be boring.  Oh well, he thought, at least he might meet up with a hot girl.  He walked out of the classroom, and down the hall.  He pushed open the door, as a crowd of other students crowded through it.  He walked through his school's beautiful mall, and onto the football field.
<br />  
<br />	This was Gordon Prep, a college prep school in sunny Springersville, California.  Jack was a typical fifteen-year-old sophomore, he liked rock music, video games, and watching TV, in between school and the massive amounts of homework he got.  The school was hard, all right, but he hoped it would help him get into a good college.
<br />  
<br />	He was halfway across the football field, when he happened to look up.  He saw a small, bright light in the sky.  He wondered what it was.  It was too big to be an airplane, and it sure wasn?t a star.  The strange thing was, however, that the light seemed to be getting larger and larger.  He was about to ask someone about it, but he noticed that no one else was around.  Puzzled, he looked around.  He saw a few groups of students in the mall, but no one else was on the field.  He glanced at his watch.  He had one minute until the bell!  Before he went on to science class, he took one more glance at the light.  Now it was huge.  Something told him that it, whatever it was, was coming towards him.  His mind said to run, but his body stayed planted to that one spot.  He watched as the light grew bigger and bigger, and as the fear in the pit of his stomach grew and grew.  Again, he tried to move, but he remained at the spot.  Now, he wanted nothing more than to run, to get to the safety of the science hall, mere yards away, and sit in his desk.  The thing came closer.  He heard a scream.  As he wondered whether or not it had been he who had screamed, he saw a bright flash, and his world spun around and around.  Then, everything went black.

			<div class="content">New chapter!
<br />
<br />        <b>Chapter Two   </b>
<br />	<b>Planet Earth, Sol System   </b>
<br />
<br />	Jack opened his eyes.  His mind was blank.  He could tell he was on the ground, but how he had gotten there, he didn't know.  Slowly, it started coming back to him.  The light, the scream, the explosion.  What had it been?  What had happened?
<br />  
<br />	He glanced around.  No one was outside.  Either they were too scared to come out, or they hadn't heard the explosion, for some reason.  Slowly, Jack pulled himself up.  He looked to his left, and what he saw made him step back.
<br />  
<br />	It was a large ship of some kind, though he was unable to determine the origin.  Was it a new airplane?  No, not the right shape or size.  Was it a missile?  He doubted it.  Missiles were more aerodynamic than this thing.  Was it a spaceship?  He almost laughed, but he realized that nothing else seemed to fit.  The ship was about twenty feet tall, and eighty feet long.  It was made of a metal he had never seen before; it was gray, but had a strange shine to it.  The strangest thing, however, was a set of three large guns on the front, and a variety of smaller ones on various parts of the ship.  On the side of the ship, there was a long orange line, and the word <i>Flamechaser </i>  underneath.
<br />   
<br />	Since he was alone, he decided to take a look inside.  Little did he know; this choice would alter his life forever.
<br />
<br />	He opened a small hatch on the side of the ship, which was just large enough to fit a man.  The hatch was heavy, because it was rather thick.  He stepped inside.  There was a hall, which connected to another hall.  He took a right, and as he walked along, he saw four rooms, two on each side, that had no doors.  Inside each, there was one bed, and one of the rooms had a footlocker at the end of the bed.  The beds looked fairly uncomfortable.
<br /> 
<br />	As he continued, he came across a large room.  It was packed with strange boxes and crates along the sides.  He walked over to one.  One word was written on the crate, H-Fuel .  He then walked over to one of the boxes.  Niobium  was written on it.
<br />
<br />	He walked back through the hall, and went past where he came in from.  Shortly, he arrived in a room.  This was the cockpit of the ship, which he had absolutely decided it was.  A large window, and three chairs.  Many gauges, switches, consoles, screens, and buttons lined the front wall.  He looked down, and jumped back.  A body was lying in the floor!
<br />  
<br />	He walked up to it, and took a closer look.  A young man, with some sort of flight suit on, was lying there.  A huge gash covered half his face.  It was obvious that he had been thrown from his seat when his ship had wrecked, and he had hit the console and fell to the floor.  He was about to run and call for help, but he took another look at the man, and he saw that he was dead.
<br />  
<br />	He realized he was already way in over his head.  Once he was found, there would be a huge government investigation, he would have to testify, he might be found guilty of killing this man.  He suddenly became very afraid.  What if that did happen?  What would happen to him?  What if this was a government project, and they accused him of messing it up?
<br />  
<br />	He quickly, and irrationally, decided to flee.  He sat down in the middle seat, and he saw a group of students running down the field, with teachers following.  Did he hear sirens?  He quickly glanced at the controls in front of him.  On the main screen in front of him, he saw the words Initiate Takeoff Sequence?  flashing on the screen.  He hit the button that said &quot;Yes&quot; that was right under that screen.
<br />  
<br />	He heard engines rumble.  The students stopped, staring at the ship, as it began to lift off.  The ship gained altitude, and Jack noticed that the students were getting smaller and smaller.  Then, the nose lifted up, and the ship quickly gained speed.  He could now see the sky, and he was rapidly moving upwards in it.  Moments later, he entered outer space.

			<div class="content">Part 3, coming up!  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />        <b>Chapter Three
<br />	Near Planet Earth, Sol System    </b>
<br />
<br />	The view was incredible.  Thousands of stars in front of him, and the beautiful view of Earth behind him.  The ship continued into space.
<br />  
<br />	Jack looked around at the screens that surrounded him.  One in particular intrigued him.  It had a sort of 2D map, and on it was a portion of the Solar System.  On the top, it said Unknown System.  He could see Earth, and the moon, and the sun, but no other planets.  The only other things on the map were a small blue and red circle, which read To Texas , and a yellow line.  The line came from the circle, went to Earth, turned around, and went back out, with a small icon that appeared to be a ship on the end of it.  Jack figured that this had to be the path that the pilot had traveled, and that he was now taking.  He touched the circle, and small set of icons appeared.  He selected the one that said &quot;Go To This,&quot; and a purple line came up on the screen.  It connected the ship icon to the circle.  The ship turned slightly, and a loud rumble could be heard.  The ship accelerated after a few seconds, and picked up speed rapidly.
<br />  
<br />	As he was traveling, Jack looked at a few of the other screens.  One said &quot;Ship Info&quot;.  On this screen, there was a list of stats on this ship.  It said:
<br />
<br />Name: Flamechaser
<br />Pilot: William Walters
<br />Crew: 1
<br />Total Crew Slots: 4
<br />Ship Class: EL-HiL27 Liberty Standard Freighter, 'Rhino'
<br />Armament:
<br />  3 Justice Mk. II Liberty Laser Cannons
<br />  5 Advanced Starbeam Civilian Laser Turrets
<br />  Drone Mine Dropper (25)
<br />  Countermeasure Dropper  (40)
<br />Armor: 1600 
<br />Shielding: Advanced Guardian Freighter Shield
<br />Power Plant: IX3500 Liberty Freighter Class
<br />Cargo Hold: 80
<br />
<br />	It all seemed foreign to Jack.  Wherever this ship came from, it was human, but wasn't anything from Earth.  This puzzled Jack.  Humans that weren't on Earth?  Was that even possible?
<br />  
<br />	Suddenly, the ship slowed, and then stopped altogether.  Jack looked back over at the map.  The ship was now right next to the circle.  He looked out the main viewport.  What he saw shocked him.
<br />  
<br />	A huge, round, blue and red, rotating circle was in front of the ship.  It was constantly moving and rotating, and Jack thought that it might be alive.  Suddenly, words appeared on the map screen.  Dock with jumphole?   &quot;What the heck?&quot; he thought, as his teenage curiosities kicked in.  He hit yes.  The circle started moving very fast, the ship moved closer, and he was afraid.  Then, the circle swallowed the ship, and Jack left his place and time.

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter Four
<br />	North Dallas Debris Field, Texas System   </b>
<br />
<br />	The tunnel of light abruptly ended, and the Flamechaser  was spit out into a large, black cloud.  Jack looked around, no flashing lights on the console, which meant everything was probably okay.  He glanced out the window, and was dumbfounded by what he saw.  He appeared to be in a cloud.  He didn't recall there being clouds in space.
<br />  
<br />	Then, it came to him.  In his science class, he had learned about nebulas in their astronomy unit.  They appeared to be clouds, but were just large areas of dust and vapor.  He figured that he had to be in one of those.  He looked at the map, and saw the same yellow line going through a black area, which he assumed was this cloud, and went out to a small space station.  A space station?  This was getting weirder by the second.  Humans had only built a few of those, and they had never discovered a route to another solar system, so where was he?
<br />  
<br />	He needed to find answers, so he pressed his finger on the station image, and clicked the small &quot;Go to&quot; button.  The engines started up as before, and soon he was off towards the station.  The cloud appeared to be quite large on the map, so he took the opportunity to explore the ship a bit more.  He decided that he was going to get rid of the man's body, so whomever he came in contact with wouldn't think that Jack had killed him.  He knew that this was far beyond any government project now.  Then, he came up with an idea.  He should put on the man's strange jumpsuit, so he would fit in a bit more.  He felt that it wasn't a good idea to go walking into a strange place with the clothes he was wearing on.  He took the man back to one of the small bedrooms, and took off the jumpsuit, then stored the man's body on the bed, and closed the door.  He then selected another room to store his things in, changed clothes, and then put his school clothes in the footlocker at the foot of the bed.  The jumpsuit fit rather well, though it was strange to get used to.  He strapped the strange handgun, which the man had been carrying, around his waist.  Jack then moved back to the cockpit, just as the ship exited the nebula cloud.
<br />
<br />	Jack saw a large asteroid field ahead.  He was afraid the ship might hit one of the asteroids, but when he entered the field, the ship nimbly dodged all of the asteroids.  Jack figured that the ship had to have some sort of auto pilot feature.  He glanced at the map, the base was coming up.
<br />
<br />	Two minutes later, Jack could make out a small metal object ahead.  Soon, he could make out most of the station.  As he got closer, he realized the immense scale of the base.  Surely large enough to house an entire community!  Nothing like this was known to the human race!  He pulled up close to the base, and his engines cut.  A message flashed up on map.  &quot;Dock with Station?&quot;  Jack hit yes, and the ship moved towards one of the slowly opening ports on the side of the station.
<br />
<br />	The ship silently moved through the port.  Inside, he could see a large area, which the ship automatically set down onto.  No one was there, but a few doors lined the wall.  Before he got out of the ship, he pulled the handgun out of its holster, and looked at it.  It was a silver color, with a trigger like most human guns, but it had some small buttons on one side.  Each one seemed to represent a specific rating of damage or pain done to the target.  Lethal, Pain, Blackout, and Stun were the settings.  He pressed Stun, and made his way back out of the ship.
<br />
<br />	On the landing pad, he noticed one door that was larger than the others.  It had a large gateway over it, and when he walked up to the door, he saw a sign to the right.  It read: Madison Base Bar, est. 815 AS.  Written in plain English.  Jack walked into the bar.  
<br />
<br />	Inside, there was a large room, with about twenty tables, a bar in one corner, and a long viewport showing the asteroid field along one of the walls.  The entire room was built out of a strange gold-colored metal.  There were about fifteen people in the room, and strange techno music played in the background.  Men and women were hanging around, drinking strange drinks, and talking to each other.  Only the bartender and one man in the corner saw him enter.  He quietly walked over to a far corner and sat down.  The people in here had an evil feel about them.  Perhaps he had come to the wrong place.  Most unnerving, however, was the unending stare of the man in the corner.  He hadn't taken his eyes off Jack since Jack had entered.  Jack felt very nervous.  He took a glance in the man's direction.  He was a young man, slightly older than Jack himself, he had light brown hair, and brown eyes.  It were the eyes the intrigued Jack, however.  They showed an age far beyond the appearance of the man, attesting to far too many things seen and learned.
<br />  
<br />	Jack stood up slowly, as to not attract attention.  He needed to get back to his ship and get away from here.  He needed to go back home, and tell everyone about what he'd seen.  He started to take a step forward, and then he heard a loud, dull thud.  He was thrown to the floor, as sirens came on throughout the base.  A voice came over the loudspeaker.
<br />
<br />	&quot;All pilots to their ships!  Repeat, all pilots to their ships!  We are under attack by Liberty forces!  This is not a drill!&quot;
<br />
<br />	Liberty, Jack knew that name.  It was on the ship information screen.  His ship was a Liberty ship.  Confused, Jack was about to pull himself up.  The bar was quickly emptying.  The man in the corner had stood up, but was not running to the door; he was running straight at Jack!  The man grabbed Jack, and carried him out the door.  He ran out, and called to Jack, &quot;Which ship is yours?&quot;  Jack pointed to his ship.  The man ran to it, opened the hatch, and pulled Jack in, while closing the hatch behind him.  He then put Jack down, and sprinted in the direction of the cockpit.  Jack was too dazed to do anything, but when he recovered his senses, he followed.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;What are you doing?  You drag me out of the bar, and now you're hijacking my ship!&quot; Jack cried.
<br />
<br />	The man was sitting in the center chair, and Jack could tell that they were lifting off the floor of the station.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Look, there's no time to explain now.  You have no choice but to trust me.  I can get us out of this mess alive, if you help me!&quot; the man responded.
<br />
<br />	Jack was in no position to keep arguing, obviously this man knew something he didn't.  Jack really didn't care about the ship, all he wanted were answers and a ride home, which he was sure the man could give him.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Alright, what do you want me to do?&quot; Jack asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Just sit down, and be quite.  You will have your answers soon enough.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How did you...?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Jack stopped in mid-sentence.  The ship had just exited the docking port, and what he saw shocked him.  A huge, long ship, as large as the station itself, was sitting outside the station.  It was firing large bolts of energy at the station, and a bunch of small ships were tangled in a fight around both the large ship and the base.
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Mississippi,&quot; the man said.
<br />
<br />	Jack remained silent, he knew he would have a lot of questions, if they survived this.
