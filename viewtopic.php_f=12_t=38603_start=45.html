			<div class="content">And so history repeated itself.
<br />
<br />Up from the ashes of the PDRNS a sooty raven arose.... the IPRT... but I get ahead of myself.
<br />
<br />In those beginning times, it was a group effort of all the people to return the land to peaceful prosperity.  And Tawakalna's words proved wise.  And in their gratitude, the people brought gifts to him.
<br />
<br />In the beginning, the gifts were humble fare, fruit, cigarette, home brewed beer,  chocolate candies and the like.  But in time, with growing prosperity came greater largesse.  No longer just a fruit but a whole basket of fruit, not just a cigarette but a pack of them, not just home brewed beer but a six pack of the store bought variety....
<br />
<br />And so the material boon to Tawakalna grew and as it grew, a small ember within him grew hotter.  As the gifts grew to bushels, cartons and casks, that ember burst into a flame of greed of ambition.
<br />
<br />Now Tawakalna demanded his tribute lest he withhold his wisdom from the people.  And the people complied as they became more and more unable to think for themselves.  They did what they could to forefend against the stopping of that wellspring of knowledge that was Tawakalna.
<br />
<br />In the end, nothing short of total investment of all things of value with Tawakalna would suffice.  And on that day of total surrender, the IPRT was born.</div>

			<div class="content">In the hazy mists of the between time.  The age when the PDRNS was no more and the IPRT was yet to be, a beaten man, a man with no purpose wandered about the countryside.
<br />
<br />He sought escape in any form he could find it but preferred herbs and patent medicines of a certain mind altering quality.
<br />
<br />He slept in storm drains, took meals from the garbage put out at night by restaurants ... and stole their tea towels for clothing and warmth.  And he dreamed his dreams.  Of strange stuffed animal-like beings that told him to be nice and good and thoughtful and honest. ...To be what he'd never think of being were he in a more lucid state.
<br />
<br />Dreams turned to reality and reality turned to dreams as he wandered about from one restaurant refuse bin to another.
<br />
<br />One day, while feasting lustily at an Indian takeaway, almost suffocating himself in the discards of shrimp vindaloo and chicken tikka masala, a restaurant washup boy caught sight of him ripping open the rubbish bags to get at the morsels within and chased after him with a broken mop.
<br />
<br />Cornered, the dreamer turned on his assailant and shed the tea towels that were draped about his head.  The attacker stopped and howled at the site of the horrid green visage, dropped the mop handle and ran away shrieking &quot;aaaiiieeeeeeeeeeee!&quot;
<br />
<br />After evacuating what turned out to be rather tainted vindaloo and masala then and there, and still breathing heavily the stranger rearranged the tea towels, picked up the mop handle and headed back to his resting place, an abandoned warehouse.
<br />
<br />There he slept fitfully, dreaming of even stranger things of stuffed animals morphing in to military officers and suited government apparatchiks.... of redundant arrays of inexpensive disk drives, overflights of military aircraft and endless parades of armored battalions and shock troops... and of rows upon rows of American chocolate candies, Irish cigarettes and lascivious magazines.
<br />
<br />On the morning, the tea towel wrapped stranger was gone......Soon after, however, tales began to spring up of a wise man who could solve many problems of the day with simple words and kind gestures.....

			<div class="content">Hello everyone, you may not remember me but I'm Oghma, ex-modder, professional lurker, and veteran of these forums since 2003. At this time, I would like to confirm my support for the Rabbit-God, and would also like to take this opportunity to quote a passage from the &quot;Book of the Rabbit&quot;, Genesis, Chapter II, Verse V as penned by the High Priest of the Rabbit-God himself. 
<br />
<br />&quot;And so it was that on the third day, the Rabbit-God came down from on-high in a fiery chariot that outshone the sun itself and proclaimed His Lordship and Dominion over the hopping and peaceful inhabitants of Esquilaxitavia. It is told that He then raised His paws to the heavens and cried 'Today is a Holy day! Today let the Word go forth from this time and place that Esquilaxitavia is under the protection of the Rabbit-God! Let all heed well the words of the Rabbit-God and obey well the words of His chosen priests! Now go ye forth and multiply, as only the folk of Esquilaxitavia can in order that we may grow and prosper, and defend ourselves against those who would consume us!&quot;  As He lowered his paws from the heavens, a great cry went up, and word travelled throughout the city. And so it was that the fonts and basins in the Great Cathedral burst forth and overflowed with the Holy Libation Ginger Beer, and all stood in amazement, and there was much rejoicing and consumption of carbonated beverages. And so it was that the people of the Rabbit-God proclaimed their love for Him, knowing that their patron would watch over them, and protect them from the enemies of the Rabbitfolk of which the rabbit-eating Mullah of Tawakalnistan was foremost, followed closely by the blasphemous practices of the leader of Daftopia....&quot;

			<div class="content">Kai-Ping-Fu was great! he told interesting stories and was a bloody good laugh. And.. he ended up at the court of Kublai Khan in legendary Xanadu - oh yes...
<br />
<br />Carnevale was a bit of an arse though, I must admit. do you know, he's working as a guide for American tourists in the Congo of all places?
