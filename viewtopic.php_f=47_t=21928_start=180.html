<br />
<br />Michael closed the door and looked at Lutz who was taking care of Alys. She obviously thought Lutz was dead and went into some kind of a shock when she saw him standing before her.
<br />Michael wondered if she ever received the message wich Quigley was supposed to send to her.
<br />
<br />&quot;How is she?&quot; Michael asked
<br />
<br />&quot;She'll be alright.&quot; Lutz answered in an abcent tone. He was looking at his wife. He was obviously relieved to see her again after all those months of uncertainty
<br />
<br />&quot;Well that's great. Is hope she's gonna wake up soon, because we need to go. I bet that woman at the desk has already called security and we can't risk to get caught.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz didn't reply, but instead kept staring at Alys.
<br />
<br />&quot;LUTZ! We need to go.&quot; Michael shouted. A neighbour woke up and hit the wall, ordering them to be quiet.
<br />
<br />Lutz looked up to Michael who was now standing right beside him.
<br />
<br />&quot;You're right.&quot; he said and gently patted Alys on the cheek trying to wake her.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, wake up baby.&quot;
<br />
<br />She opened her eyes and looked straight into Lutz' eyes, looked at Michael and looked back at Lutz. she streched out her hand and touched Lutz' cheek.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's you.&quot; she determined with a smile and rose.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes honey, it's me. I've come to get you out of here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But I thought you were...&quot; She didn't finish that scentence. The thought alone was unbearable.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, I'm alive.&quot; He said as his smile got brighter.
<br />
<br />&quot;But how.. I mean, I recieved your message from West Point and later I heard it was distroyed and I though, oh my god, Lutz...&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz bent over and kissed her on the mouth, thereby shutting her up.
<br />
<br />Michael sighed in a form of desparation, they were never getting out of there in time if they kept screwing around.
<br />
<br />&quot;I wasn't at West Point,&quot; Lutz explained, &quot;that was a friend of mine. He send that message, but don't worry, he made it out alive.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, we need to go.&quot; Michael said impatiantly.
<br />
<br />Alys sat up straight and looked at Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked. She must have forgotten about talking to him on the phone.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'd like to introduce you to Michael Armstrong.&quot; Lutz said as he helped Alys on her feet.  &quot;One of the best pilots in Sirius. He saved my life several times.&quot; Michael came forth to shake her hand.
<br />
<br />&quot;And he's done the same for me.&quot; Michael said.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's always good to meet a friend of Lutz'. But what are you two doing here?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You know about the war right?&quot; Said Lutz. Alys nodded. &quot;We're part of it and Liberty want's us dead.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? why?&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz started to explain her the whole story, but Michael interrupted.
<br />
<br />&quot;We have no time guys,&quot; he said as he looked through the window. &quot;The cops have arrived.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn.&quot; said Lutz, &quot;so much for a clean escape.&quot;
<br />
<br />They left the appartment, passed the elevator and straight to the stairwell. Lutz grabbed his blasters and carefully opened the door and peaked through.
<br />He gave the all clear and they followed him down the stairs. First Alys and Michael to give protection from behind.
<br />
<br />They quickly but carefully descended to lower levels.
<br />When they reached the seventh floor they heared the door on the ground level open. Lutz stopped and looked down. He saw a half a dozen cops making their way upstairs.
<br />
<br />They exitted the stairwell as quietly as possible, but Michael lost hold of the door, wich slammed shut. They could hear the men downstairs talking to eachother as new orders were probably given to all to go to the seventh floor.
<br />At the same moment they saw the elevator aproaching.
<br />
<br />Michael cursed and turned to Alys.
<br />
<br />&quot;Is there another way out of here?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, there is an external fire-escape. You can access it from every apartment through the window.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good.&quot; Said Lutz and he tried the first door - it was closed. He aimed his blaster at the lock and fired. The shot ripped through the wooden door and Lutz kicked it open.
<br />
<br />Just as the elevatordoors opened, Michael, Lutz and Alys entered the apartment. A few shots were fired at them, but they hit nothing but walls.
<br />
<br />&quot;Go, go go!&quot; Yelled Michael as they ran down the livingroom and turned left into the bedroom. A man and woman started to screem, scared by the sudden raid. Lutz, who was on point, shot through the window and shattered glas fell on the fire-escape and down on the pavement. He went through, followed by Alys and then Michael who fired a few shots at the bedroom door, because he saw the first cop come around the corner.
<br />
<br />Unaware if he'd hit the man, he climbed out of the window and followed the others down the stairs. The scared couple still screamed and screamed even louder as the cops ran through their room. The first man who reached the window carefully looked outside. Michael looked up at that moment and shot at the man, forcing him to take cover. But only for a while, because when Michael ceased fire in order to escape, the cop, along with a few others, imediately opened fired upon them.
<br />
<br />The metal rosters of the stairs covered them and deflected most of the shots. The cops started to pour out of the window and persued them.
<br />Lutz had reached the lowest fixed level of the stairs and carefully stepped on the self-retractable ladder and descended to groundlevel.
<br />He held on to the ladder in order for it not to retract again and Alys started to climbe down.
<br />
<br />At that very moment six cops, probably the ones from the stairwell, rounded the corner. They couldn't see Lutz as he was obstructed from their sights by a large dumpster, but they could see Alys and Michael.
<br />Without any warning they started shooting. Alys, who was taken totally by surprise, lost grip as a few shots impacted uncomortably close to her on the ladder. She fell down on the sidewalk and injured her wrist.
<br />
<br />Lutz rushed to her and let go of the ladder wich retracted itself. Michael had in the meantime started to return fire. He managed to take down one cop before they had taken cover behind corners and cars. Michael hit a few of the cars, wich set of their alarms and a terrible screaming noise of three different caralarms filled the air and temporarely stunned the few who had taken cover behind them.
<br />
<br />Michael saw that Lutz and Alys were relatively save behind the dumpster, but not for long as the other cops were now almost directly on top of them. Michael decided to take the risk of injury and climbed over the railing and let himself drop on the ground. He crouched down to absorb the fall. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Can you run?&quot; He asked Alys, as Lutz started to shoot the cops behind the cars in order to hold them back.
<br />
<br />Michael grabbed his blaster and shot at the men above him. He hit two of them and the others crouched up against the wall behind the steps of the stairs.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. But I think I might have broken my wrist.&quot; she answered while she supported her right arm with her other arm.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good. Lutz, we gotta go.&quot; He said while he kept firing.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, on the count of three.&quot; said Lutz, who leaned against the dumpster and fired at the men still on the stairs. He hit one guy who fell over the railing onto the street. Only two were left on the stairs and four more behind the cars. They had a chance.
<br />
<br />&quot;One...&quot; They had to run all the way to the end of the street.
<br />
<br />&quot;Two...&quot; From there it was a good run to the train station wich would take them to the landing site, but if they could make it at least to the mall they would be save.
<br />
<br />&quot;Three!&quot; Lutz and Alys got up and ran down the street, partially covered by the dupmster but in clear view of the men on the stairs. The men however, had to get out of their relatively save hideout in order to get a clear shot and as soon as they did that, Michael shot them. He killed one and hit the other in the shoulder, causing him to drop his gun.
<br />
<br />Lutz and Alys had made it around the corner and Lutz started to return fire to cover Michael's escape. Michael got up and zig-zagged through the street trying to avoid enemy fire. He almost made it when he felt something hit his arm.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, you're bleeding.&quot; Lutz said as Michael turned the corner and he pointed at his arm.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn,&quot; he said and looked at it. The shot had torn away a strip of suit on the back of his upper arm and ripped through the flesh. It was bleeding, but not bad. He was glad he didn't see bone.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's nothing, just a flesh wound.&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />&quot;You think you're still able to fly?&quot; Lutz asked, while he returned fire around the corner.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, ofcourse. Now let's go.&quot;
<br />
<br />They ran of to the mall. It was empty.
<br />
<br />&quot;Strange,&quot; said Lutz as they rested shortly. &quot;You'd expect them to call for back-up, but we've seen no one else except these guys.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We're not there yet Lutz.&quot; said Michael, who returned fire.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're gonna make it right?&quot; Alys asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course we are honey. It's gonna be a breeze for us.&quot; Lutz kissed her on the forehead and lead them down the mall. They reached the exit to the train station and luckily they could catch the train just before it left. They sat down and Alys grabbed Michaels arm. She twisted it a bit so that the wound would be clearly visible in the light. Michael moaned a bit as she did.
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to cover that before it starts to infect.&quot; she said as she looked at Michaels shirt. He noticed it, but before he could react she had torn off a large piece and started to wrap it around his wound.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, that's a good shirt.&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />&quot;There,&quot; she said as she tied up the piece of shirt. &quot;That'll do for a while. But you need to get a bandage, or it will get infected.&quot; She warned.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks, as soon as we get to the <i>Arizona </i> I'll have someone take a look at it.&quot; He looked into her eyes for a second and saw why Lutz had married this woman. She had to be scared, but yet there was no evidence for that. She acted with a calme and clear mind wich was usually seen with surgeons right before they had to do a lifesaving operation.
<br />
<br />The train stopped at the staton and they got out. They ran to the exit of the station and Michael looked around the corner. He could see the <i>Nova Sailor </i> standing in front of the <i>Defiant </i>. All seemed to be clear.
<br />
<br />He was just about to lead them to the ships, when he noticed a movement behind a small building, wich was part of the accomodation. He recognised a police uniform. He looked again and saw several more behind some crates.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn.&quot; he said and looked at Lutz. &quot;No way we can get to our ships. there are at least five cops hiding and probably more.&quot;
<br />
<br />Just at that moment they heared a huge explosion. In front of them they saw a large column of smoke rise to the sky, lit by flames of a burning building. They could hear sirens in the distance and several other, smaller explosions. They heared the squealing engines of a few fighters. The fighters came closer and Michael could make out an Anubis followed by two regular Defenders. His heart skipped a beat because of the excitement of seeing that ship. <i>It has to be him </i>, he thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, isn't that an Anubis?&quot; Lutz asked. He probably had the same idea.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, you think it's him?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Could it be? That's a big stunt he pulled of then, If it is him.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;what are you talking about? What's going on up there?&quot; asked Alys, who was confused.
<br />
<br />&quot;Baby,&quot; said Lutz, &quot;If we're not mistaking, that's our way out of here.&quot; He turned to Michael. &quot;You think you can make it to your ship?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, they are sort of distracted. Give Alys one of your guns and get your ass behind that car. You can both cover me and I can make it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A gun?&quot; said Alys in protest, &quot;No way, I'm not gonna shoot anybody. No way.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You don't have to aim, just sort of shoot at them to keep their heads down.&quot; Michael tried to convince her. &quot;That's the only way I can make it to my ship and contact our pal up there.&quot;
<br />
<br />Just as he sad that, one of the defenders crashed into the field right behind the landing site, causing an explosion that shook the entire landing pad.
<br />
<br />&quot;Now!&quot; shouted Michael and without waiting he ran of to his ship. He knew the cops were distracted by the crash and he could make it half way without being detected. Just as one of the more clever cops turned his attention back to the landingsite, Michael reached a large container.
<br />
<br />He hid behind it and a couple of shots shot past the crate. <i>Lets hope it doesn't explode like it does in the computergames </i>, he thought.
<br />
<br />Lutz and Alys had started shooting and actually managed to drive the cops back in to their hiding places. Michael recieved the signal from Lutz and ran to his ship. He quickly entered his ship and started up the engines and his shield.
<br />
<br />He targeted the Anubis and opened a commchanel.
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger, is that you up there wreaking havoc?&quot; Michael waited a second and then repeated his question. Nobody replied and he was about to give up when his comm crackled and the distinctive, but unclear voice of Roger O'Connor came through.
<br />
<br />&quot;...es Mich...l, I read you. ...ow are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm fine O'Connor, but you're signal is breaking up.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;...can't hear you. ... need help?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? Do you need help? Come in O'Connor.&quot; Nothing. Michael feared the worst and when he saw a fighter going down in flames, he hoped sincerely it wasn't O'Connor.
<br />
<br />Michael took of and hovered about ten meters above the deck. He turned around and aimed at the police officers. They were too stunned to do anything. Michael fired a few warningshots and the men chose wisely and fled. Lutz and Alys entered the <i>Defiant </i> and within seconds both ships rose to the cruise-hight of 500 meters.
<br />
<br />&quot;How are you guys doing?&quot; Michael asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're ok. It's a bit crowded though. Can you see O'Connor?&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael checked his scanner and was relieved to see an Anubis heading towards their location and that he wasn't followed by an Armada of ships.
<br />
<br />&quot;You called?&quot; O'Connors voice was clear and bright. Though he must have had a hell of a fight, Michael couldn't hear if O'Connor was tired. <i>He must be tired </i>, Michael thought, <i>this man is full of surprises </i>.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn you O'Connor, you had us worried mate.&quot; Lutz said, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'll tell you later, we need to get the hell out of here. I just blew up a military base and I'm pretty sure that the navy is coming.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A military base? Damn,&quot; said Michael respectfully, &quot;I'm surprised they aren't here already.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, they will be here and if we hang around much longer and you can be sure they're gonna give us hell.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You're right Lutz. O'Connor, do you have any bright ideas?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't think they're just gonna let us use the docking ring freely, so we need to distroy the controlpost first. The ring will be automatically set to manual. All we have to do is radio in and we're good to go.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You make it sound so easy.&quot; Michael replied, &quot;Lead the way Roger.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;you got it. Keep your eyes open at all times. They're bound to know we're coming.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael sighed; <i>another suicide manouvre coming up </i> he thought as he falled in behind O'Connor. But he knew just as Lutz and O'Connor did, that it was the only way out. An atmosphere take-off was to risky. The chance that one of them was gonna loose control of his ship in the attempt was far to big without a proper control tower.
<br />A docking-ring escape was the only &quot;save&quot; way.
<br />
<br />The controlpost was most likely heavily guarded so he prepared for a big fight. And if they managed to get of Manhattan, they still had to deal with the fleet of ships outside.
<br />
<br />Again he couldn't deny that irritating fealing that lingered in his stomache and gave him the creapy feeling, something was about to go wrong.
<br />
<br />Michael detected the controlpost and about a dozen Defenders waiting for them.
<br />
<br />&quot;I read about a dozen bad boys at twelfe o'clock, be ready for anything. 10k and closing.&quot;
<br />
<br />He heared two short static clicks as O'Connor and Lutz silently replied.
<br />
<br />In space 10k was quite a comfortable distance to start preparing for battle, but somehow Michael thought that the laws of physics applied diferently on a planet. Before he realised it he had to evade five missiles and fast.
<br />
<br />He pulled up as O'Connor shouted on the radio to brake formation. The missiles all missed him somehow, but he had now four Defenders on his tail. Although these weren't the XS-type wich were probably needed at the front, the guns mounted on those defenders did some serious damage to his shield. And Michael realised very well that the defenders had the advantage of being smaller and lighter than Michael's Falcon. Therefore they were more agile and and a lot faster.
<br />
<br />He banked hard to the left and felt the g-forces torturing his body and he could feal the wound in his arm starting to bleed again. He noticed his shieldintegrity dropping to almost zero. He deployed some bats and his shield regenerated to full capacity.
<br />
<br />His instinct told him to drop mines, but his rationality told him that mines wouldn't work out here, as they would drop straight down due to the planets gravity. The same aplied for countermeasures, wich he found out as he deployed some in order to shake of a few missiles. Two of them hit home and his shield dropped to 10%. Michael pulled up and slowed down. Four defenders shot past him surpirsed by the manouvre, wich in turn surprised Michael a bit because it was concidered the oldest trick in the book.
<br />
<br />Michael targeted the engine of one of the defenders and fired his Avarice and a missile. The bolts effectively erased it's shields and the missile hit home. The engine failed and the defender fell helpless to the ground.
<br />
<br />He did a quick scan and noticed how Lutz and O'Connor had less trouble with the defenders the he did. They had each taken down two already.
<br />
<br />He noticed how two defenders had turned around to take him head on. Michael grinned, this was in his advatage, his guns were more powerful and his shield was almost fully regenerated. He aimed and fired his Avarice again. He took down both their shields and pulled the trigger wich fired his other guns. But the Avarice had used up to much power and the guns didn't fire at all. The surprise stunned him while his enemies fired all they had. Just as his shield failed, Michael saw one of the defenders explode and O'Connors Anubis passed in front of Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, distroy the controlcenter. it's directly below us. Lutz and I will hold of the defenders.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You got it.&quot; said Michael who was kinda relieved to take a brake from the action, he wasn't sure if he'd survived it if Roger hadn't helped him. <i>My arm must bother me more than I realised </i>, he figured.
<br />
<br />He circled down and soon he could see the controlpost. He fired a misile at it and hoped nobody was inside. The post exploded with a huge blast. He didn't realise that the missile was so distructive. In space, the vacu&#252;m smothered the flames, but on a planet, especially on the oxigen-rich Manhattan, you could witness them at full force.
<br />He looked at his scanner and saw that the status of the docking ring had changed from <b>operator-control </b> to <b>Manual-control </b>.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're good to go guys, docking-ring is set to manual.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Just in time,&quot; said Lutz, &quot;I got more bogeys inbound from the north and the southeast. About 50 in total.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sounds like a good time to leave.&quot; said O'Connor. &quot;Follow me, lads. I'll lead you through.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Wait.&quot; said Michael, What's our plan? we can be sure that a lot of Liberty fighters are waiting for us. Maybe even a Battleship and we won't be able to take down one, because the Fireblade is toast.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Run like hell, that's what we're gonna do.&quot; O'Connor replied. &quot;But in case it gets hot out there, you need to create a diversion for us Michael. I'll stay with Lutz and escort him out of the system.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What are you talking Roger, Michael's coming with us. Nobody is creating any diversion, because nobody would survive that.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, he's right Lutz. It's the only way. My Falcon is a lot more agile and is therefore perfect for the job. O'Connor's Anubis has the strength and durability needed to protect you and Alys.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No Michael, that's madness! You'll get killed! I won't let you do that, you hear, you're coming with us, no arguments.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael could here his friends desperation. But strangely he himself was in peace with the dicision. He knew all along that something like this was going to happen and had prepared himself for it ever since they left Malaga base.
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't worry Lutz, I'll be alright. Just get your ass to Bretonian space and get to the <i>Arizona </i> as soon as possible. I'll meet you there.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael waited for Lutz's protest, but he probably realized that it actually was the only chance they had to get to savety.
<br />
<br />Lutz and O'Connor would take the tradelane to West Point and from there take the jumpgate or jumphole to California, wichever was save. Michael would try to delay the persuit until they reached California. Then he would have to escape on his own. He would probably try to get to the badlands and jump to texas and from there to Magallan.
<br />
<br />He took a deep breath as O'Connor lead them through the docking-ring. <i>This is it </i>, he thought and left Manhattan.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;Well,&quot; Arrigoni croaked. He coughed a few times. &quot;Here's how it goes.&quot;
<br />
<br />Arrigoni related the story to Johnson and Malystryx.
<br />
<br />&quot;It started off well enough. I was one of the four fighter pilots out there, escorting the <i>Arizona </i>, probably to go out and die first. Nothing really happend until we got to Cortez.&quot; Arrigoni paused to breathe. &quot;Then, I let my gaurd drop. I didn't think the Liberty bastards would come through a jumphole. But they did.&quot; Distant explosions still testified to that battle. &quot;They caught me off gaurd. They blew my shields. In the time it took to react, I had already taken severe hull damage.&quot;
<br />
<br />Arrigoni gulped. &quot;Then on the radio I heard the 'all pilots to their ships' and I --- I --- knew I would have to stay out there. They were going to send me out to die! So I charged into battle again, with no shields, and my bats and nanos weren't working. So I fought and fought for some time... until my ship was too badly damaged. I turned around and headed toward the <i>Arizona </i>. They were still shooting me. I could see my cockpit window breaking... I could hear the hull groaning... Smoke filled the cockpit. I tried to go in faster because if I didn't I would die. Just after I got in the bay, flames burst in the cockpit, and then everything went black.&quot; Johnson knew how Arrigoni must have felt. He was beginning to feel that pure sense of terror. &quot;I don't know when I came to, but everything was still black, so I thought to myself I must be dead. And suddenly, I realized I wasn't dead. I tried to be happy, but then a surge of pain rushed through my body. And now I'm here. Thank God that I'm alive!&quot; Johnson looked at Arrigoni. That was sincere happiness, despite all that he had gone through. Johnson figured as much, to someone who had almost met death.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you need someone here to stay with you?&quot; Johnson asked. He knew malystryx wasn't going to.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nah, I'll be fine alone.&quot; Arrigoni confessed. &quot;My throat hurts like hell.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok. Well, see you later, Arrigoni. Get better soon.&quot; With that Johnson waved goodbye, and chuckled at Arrigoni's attempt to do the same.
<br />
<br />&quot;He did go through hell.&quot; Malystryx said after they left Arrigoni's room.
<br />
<br />&quot;No kidding.&quot; An idea popped into Johnson's head. &quot;There are some things I need to check on, so I'm gonna be going.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Whatever,&quot; Malystryx replied. &quot;Crazy Rogue,&quot; she said after Johnson left.
<br />
<br />Johnson couldn't stand not knowing how far they had gotten. He still heard the faint and low engine rumbling, so they must have kept on going. He went to the bridge to get some answers.
<br />_________________________________________
<br />The bridge was a mess of wires, sparks, and dislocated metal plating. But it still functioned for some reason.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whoa whoa, you can't be here.&quot; A person told him upon entry.
<br />
<br />&quot;How far are we?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Kay, you need to go.&quot; The person stood up and tried to shove him out.
<br />
<br />&quot;How far are we?&quot; Johnson asked louder. It caught the attention of the captain.
<br />
<br />The captain hadn't got out of this unscathed. There was some bleeding on his arm, and on his forehead, and several large bruises in various places. &quot;We're almost in Bretonia. We're ordering all the fighters to tractor in life pods, and after that we're going to send the recall order.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So how'd we do, battlewise?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;We won, but at a terrible price. We lost nearly three-quarters of the fighters in battle. That's why were tractoring in life pods. They destroyed both the battleships. It was against all odds, but we pulled through.&quot; The captain responded. Johnson thought that the captain looked as if a terrible weight had been lifted off of him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wow.&quot; That was all Johnson could say. He didn't want to sing out in rejoice because of the loss but he couldn't keep himself sad because of their accomplishments. He wished he would have been out there. Stupid piece of junk, Johnson thought. &quot;Thank you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Your welcome.&quot; The captain responded. The captain then gave out orders. &quot;Scan the ship. See what's wrong and send the appropriate teams.&quot;
<br />
<br />Johnson walked out. He said &quot;We won.&quot; to everyone he met along the way. Responses included &quot;Are you serious?&quot; and &quot;It can't be,&quot; as well as &quot;Thank heaven!!&quot;
<br />
<br />Since Johnson had nothing left to do, he went to the bar. It was operating, despite the fact that there had been a heavy firefight in here.
<br />
<br />A few hours later, after the intercom had been brought online, he hear a familiar voice. &quot;This is the captain, and I am glad to tell all of you that we have won the battle and are currently in Bretonia.&quot; Cheers filled all the ship before he finished.
<br />
<br />&quot;All drinks on the house.&quot; The bartender said. Johnson took a drink, but he was content knowing that he had helped save the <i>Arizona </i> from destruction.</div>

			<div class="content">Roger closed his eyes when he told Michael to cover their escape. He didn't even listen to the conversatsion between Lutz and Michael. Somehow he felt a little hollow inside, O'Connor hasn't felt like it since he was fighting with Corsairs near Bretonia space. Roger would have wanted to make diversion himself, but eversince he found his sister whole O'Connors life had been turned upside down. He already had regreted his descision. As they entered the Docking-Ring Roger prayed that they'd all make it to the Arizona . He also took out his lucky rabbits foot, hanged it to his cockpit, put radar to maximum power, activated all weapons and even turned off his comm link. This time its not fighting for fun or something he had to do, this time others lives were at stake. &quot;Always me...&quot; was Rogers thought about all this, tho he said that a cheeseburger would be good now.

<br />Former Captain Roger O&#8217;Connor
<br />- - / - - / - - - -
<br />This has been one of the hardest days of my service. I was summoned to Manhattan by Sinclair. Also had to kill and foreign minister and not any random one, but Logan himself. But those damn LSF teams caught me very fast and I had to rely on outside help to get me out of the lockdown brig. Luckily for me Deiter was nearby and got me out of that rat infested place. We didn&#8217;t spoke much but I have the feeling I&#8217;m going to see him a lot more in the future. There was even a good side to it &#8211; I finally got my hands on the newest Rheinland technology, and they just don&#8217;t leave their little &#8216;warp&#8217; devices behind. Now all I got to do is to figure out what it is and how does it work. I&#8217;m also on my way to an unaware military base to level it of course &#8211; it never hurts to hurt the enemy! Also I have spotted a ground firefight, if I have the time then I&#8217;ll check it out.

<br />
<br />Michael was the last one to leave Manhattan. Before him he saw what he had feared all along. Two cruisers and three wings of Defenders. One of them was even of the XS type. Four Defenders aproached them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mister Walsh, mister Armstrong and mister O'Connor, you have exactly ten seconds to disable your weaponsystems and board the cruiser <i>The Conjunction </i>.&quot; Said the leader.
<br />
<br />&quot;My god.&quot; said O'Connor, &quot;what do we do?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Maintain radiosilence.&quot; bellowed the Libertonian. &quot;Do as ordered or you will be distroyed.&quot;
<br />
<br />It looked like there was no way out this time.
<br />Just as Michael was beginning to consent, Lutz came up next to him and drew his attention.
<br />
<br />At first it looked like there was no way anyone could make sense of his gestures. He was pointing vigorously toward the <i>Conjunction </i> and then pointed to a spot right underneath the <i>Nova Sailor </i>. Finally it hit him. He meant his torpedo. Lutz wanted to do a torpedo-run.
<br />
<br />Michael signalled affermative and Lutz raised his hand, showing all five fingers. Michael hoped it meant 0.5k, because that was when he was gonna fire. 0.5K was the trash-hold distance to open the dockingbay doors. But he was sure that Lutz was clever enough to realise that too.
<br />
<br />They lined up with the cruiser and saw the doors open. Michael took a quick look at Lutz and knew it was time. He hoped O'Connor was aware of their plans. But even if he wasn't, he was right behind them and would be clever enough to respond with a torp or two.
<br />
<br />Michael engaged his weapons-systems and selected the cruiser.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mister Armstrong, turn down your weapons-system or we will engage.&quot; warned the cruiser.
<br />
<br />Michael fired a torpedo and at the same time Lutz fired his.
<br />
<br />&quot;All hands to battlestations, secure dockingbay! We have two torpedoes inbound.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael pushed his nose down and dived underneath the <i>Conjunction </i>. Behind him two torpedoes impacted on the landing bay, blowing a hole into the airlock. The suden decompression blew personnel, amunition and two complete wings of defenders in the direction of Manhattan where they burned in the atmosphere. O'Connor's torpedo hit the side of the cruiser and erased its shield.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, O'Connor, you know what to do. Get out of here.&quot; Michael said as he tried to avoid getting shot by the cruisers.
<br />
<br />&quot;You better make it back Michael!&quot; Lutz shouted. Michael could here the emotion in his voice.
<br />
<br />&quot;I will.&quot; Michael said, and he closed his comm unit. He knew he would have to be completely focused to get out of this mess.
<br />
<br />He turned and locked onto the <i>Conjunction </i>, ignoring the defenders wich were swirling around him. He would deal with them later.
<br />
<br />He saw on his scanner that Lutz and O'Connor had enterred the tradelane to where West Point once was. O'Connor had dropped a mine wich disabled the tradelane, delaying any persuing Defender.
<br />
<br />In a strange way he was glad they left. Sure, he needed their help. Now more than ever. But being on his own, he wouldn't have to worry anymore about his friends. It gave him the opportunity of concentrating on that wich was most important to him; Survival. and fired another torpedo at the already battered cruiser. This time at a slightly different angle wich caused the torpedo to tear out at least four of the decks directly above the docking bay.
<br />
<br />He now found himself with at least ten defenders on his tail and a couple of cruiser turrets aimed at him. He banked hard right and felt the g-forces push him firmly into his seat. He skimmed across Manhattans atmorphere, in an attempt to shake of a few ships. It would probably be the last time Manhattan would serve him.
<br />
<br />Two ships got lost in the gravitational pull and fell down to the planet. The other eight however, were still on his tail. His best bet would be the Badlands he figured. He had just enough time to realise the irony; The Badlands had been his enemy when he served with the Liberty navy. Today, the same Badlands protected him form the same navy when he entered the New York System and it would protect him again on his exit. If he made it that far.
<br />
<br />He made it into the tradelane to Fort Bush, but not without taking some serious damage to his hull. He dropped a mine and the tradelanering disrupted behind him. He watched his shield slowly regenerate and prepared for the next phase of his escape.
<br />
<br />Fort Bush was deceptfuly quiet. Appart from a few freighttrains there were no ships in the area. He checked his scanner. It was empty. <i>Strange </i>, Michael thought, <i>I'd expected a bit more resistance then this </i>. Relieved about this unexpected brake of action, he turned his ship towards the tradelane to battleship Missouri. He knew  that he would run into a lot more resistance this time, but he had to try it.
<br />
<br />What he saw when he left the tradelane surprised him more that it relieved him. The battleship was gone. It must have been deployed to the frontline. <i>Perhaps the Liberty Navy isn't as powerfull as we all feared </i>, Michael tought, as he took another look at where the battleship had been. He checked his scanner to see if it was around, ready to sneak up to him, but it was realy gone.
<br />
<br />He stopped thinking when he heared the sound of guns impacting on his shield. He had been so focussed on the battleship, that he had unconsiously ignored the wing of defenders closing in on him. <i>They're attacking without warnign this time </i>, he thought, but he failed to remember the fact that his comms were down.
<br />He evaded the rest of their shots and headed straight for the badlands. He engaged his cruise engine, but the all four pilots fired cruisedisruptors. It was to much for his countermeasures and he dropped out of cruise.
<br />
<br />He decided not to engage them, but to lure them into the badlands. His skills in astroid field combat and his knowledge of the badlands would give him the upperhand. And the decreased scannerrange would hide him from their scanners if he could stay far enough ahead of them. SO with any luck he wouldn't have to fight at all. He hoped not, because he wasn't sure if he fit enough for yet another fight. His arm wound and the last engagements had tired him, both mentally and physically. He hungered for a good meal and a good night rest. But first he would have to get out of this mess.
<br />
<br />They followed him into the badlands and he quickly loosed them on his scanners. he set a course for the abandoned jumpgate to Magallan and hoped it was still active.
<br />He looked at his comm and remembered that he'd shut it down. He turned it on again.
<br />
<br />He reached the place where he expected to find the jumpgate, but it wasn't there. He checked his scanner, but the badlands prevented any clear scans. He started to panic. &quot;It has to be here. It was here last time. I'm sure these are the right co&#246;rdinates.&quot; He had unknowingly started to talk to himself. Something he had tried to surpress for the last few years.
<br />
<br />He turned his ship to every direction in hope to spot it with his eyes. but he got disorientated. There were also the Defenders wich had to be close and the lightning combined with the huge rocks inside this nebula didn't help him to concentrate. He checked his scanner. Nothing. he checked his navmap and saw that he was directly at the spot he had marked. He Looked around one last time. &quot;If I don't find it this time, I'm going to Texas.&quot; He said to himself.
<br />Then suddenly, in a burst of lightning he could see the vage outlinings of something that seemed man-made. He slowly headed towards it and quickly found himself inside a massive structure wich he recognised as a jumpgate.
<br />
<br />He sighed in relief and started he hysterical laughter. He sat there for at least ten minutes laughing uncontrolably about his own unjustified panic and relief that he had made it out of this mess. He wiped a few tears away as he targeted the jumpgate and hit the dock-button. the autodock lined him up with the jumpgate automatically and the generated jumphole slingshot him into Magallan.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;Sir, we have two unidentified ships on our radar. They're on an intercept course.&quot;
<br />
<br />Captian Ralph Breuer looked at his communications officer. They had come a long way since the Junkers had taken over the <i>Arizona </i>. He never would have guessed that his men would be so disciplined. But the need for discipline was high. And everybody realised that.
<br />
<br />&quot;What class.&quot; he asked as he walked over to the radar screen. It was showing several static dots, marking stations and tradelanes and two dynamic dots wich obviously marked the incoming ships.
<br />
<br />&quot;I dont know sir, but they look to small for a capship.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hail them&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Aye sir&quot;
<br />
<br />The comunications officer pushed a few buttons as he made the connection and started the standard procedure for communication with unidentified ships.
<br />
<br />&quot;Unknown ships, you are aproaching our location. Identify yourselfs.&quot;
<br />
<br />The comm channel blurted out a few static clicks and high tones and the comm officer had to turn down the volume in order not to be deafned by the noise. He repeated his question.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Commander Lutz Walsh of the Loyalist forces requesting permission to land.&quot;
<br />
<br />The comm oficer looked at his Captain.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's ok, one of the guys we picked up from Sugarland told me a few guys would catch up with us later. This Lutz guy was one of them.&quot;
<br />
<br />The comm officer nodded. &quot;Mister Walsh, you're both cleared to land at dockingbay four. Welcome to the <i>Arizona </i> sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />Breuer send one of his officers to get the pilots. He wanted speak with them personally.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The dockingbay was a mess. There were damaged fighters and equipment all over the place. two repaircrews worked overtime to repair the ships and in the middle of all that Lutz got out of his Defender-XS.
<br />
<br />&quot;My god...&quot; Lutz sighed, while holding Alys. O'Connor joined their side.
<br />
<br />&quot;That must have been one hell of a battle.&quot; Lutz looked at the captain of the <i>Vengeance </i> who seemed surprisingly fit for a pilot who just fought his way out of the lions den.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lutz said, &quot;I just hope Arrigoni made it out alive. Looking at the number of fighters and the scale of the damage, I'd say they took a fair beating.&quot;
<br />
<br />O'Connor wanted to reply, but he was interrupted by an officer.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mister Walsh?&quot; He asked, looking at O'Connor.
<br />
<br />&quot;That would be me.&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course, excuse me. Captain Breuer want's to talk to you. Will you please follow me?&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz and O'Connor looked at eachother and followed the officer.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're glad you're here,&quot; said the officer. &quot;We lost a lot of good pilots in our last engagement.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What happened?&quot; Lutz asked. <i>What a question </i> he thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;We were attacked by two Battleships and several wings of Defenders and some Valks as well. But we made it. This ship is a monster. Although we have some hull damage thanks to the boarding parties,&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Boarding parties?&quot; said O'Connor. &quot;Yeah, two of them on deck 2 and 12. Deck 12 is completely out of order and until we can dock at a shipyard we wont be able to reapair it.&quot;
<br />&quot;Here we are,&quot; said the officer and he wanted to open the doors to the bridge but hessitated as he saw Allys.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry, she'll have to wait here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why?&quot; Lutz Asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Civilians are not allowed here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It's ok, she's with me.&quot; Lutz replied somewhat agitated.
<br />
<br />&quot;I know, but orders are orders, sorry.&quot;
<br />
<br />Before the officer could react Lutz had stepped up to him and grabbed his jacket. Lutz actually tried to lift him up like he saw Terranova do it once, but he was to tired and had only just enough strength to puch the man against the door.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh yeah? Well I'm sorry too. I've just been through hell and back to rescue my wife and I lost a good friend in the procces. I havent slept for three days and I have been shot at by Defenders, Cruisers and Battleships and the only thing keeping me from collapsing right here on the spot is my wife by my side, so she's coming. Understood?&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz felt a hand on his arm. It was O'Connors'. &quot;Come, it's alright.&quot;
<br />
<br />At that moment the door opened and the officer who was leaning against the door, fell backwards on the bridge. The surprised captain looked at his officer. &quot;Ah, you found them, very good.&quot; He turned to the door where Lutz had put his arm around Allys again. O'Connor stepped onto the bridge and gazed around at all the equipment.
<br />
<br />&quot;Impressive, isn't it?&quot; The captain stept up to O'Connor. &quot;Captain Ralph Breuer, welcome to the <i>Arizona. </i>&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;O'Connor, thanks. Yes this is impressive. How did you figure out all this stuff?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We found some manuals in the captains quarters. A bit of reading and  some tests later we could handle this thing. There's not much to it, realy. Most systems work almost fully automatical.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Manuals, can you imagine that.&quot; O'Connor laughed at the neglect of the Liberty Navy. They had always been a bit careless. That came with the arrogance.
<br />
<br />&quot;And you must be the reason this man risked his life for.&quot; He said to Allys, &quot;I can't realy blame him.&quot;
<br />
<br />Allys smiled, &quot;Allys Walsh,&quot; she said as she shook his hand and for the first time since she had to leave her house so suddenly she blushed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Beautifull.&quot; said Breuer as he turned to Lutz. &quot;Then you must be Lutz. It's nice to meet you. Quite a stunt you pulled there, flying in and out of Manhattan. Though I expected to see mister Armstrong with you.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz sighed and shook his head. &quot;He didn't make it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, we don't know that. He could have made it out of there. He's a good pilot, I'm sure he found a way.&quot; O'Connor tried to cheer him up, but he heard the doubt in his own voice. Nobody could have made it out of there on his own alive.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well anyway, we have to move on,&quot; said the captain, &quot;we can't stay here. Walker said he knew some Brettonian officers who might be able to help us out. We're on our way to them.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Where is he now?&quot; Lutz asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Walker? In sickbay. He and his crew did wonders out there. Walker alone is responsible for at least 5 Defenders and Valks and most of his men have the same results. In fact, most of the fighters we have left, twelfe in total, are Navy pilots.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Twelfe. That's not much.&quot; O'Connor said.
<br />
<br />&quot;No and that's why we're glad you two are here. We need you, mister Walsh to command our remaining fighters. If'you're up to it of course. I can understand that you need some rest and a good meal first.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That would be great. And a bath too, I'd do anything for a hot bath.&quot; Lutz had managed to look conciderably fit, but in fact he could hardly keep his eyes open. He knew that as soon as he sat down he'd fall asleap.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm afraid we don't have a bath for you Commander,&quot; It was the first time Breuer called him by his rank and Lutz knew that meant he had to forfil his duty. But he would accept it. &quot;But we have a quarters ready for you and your wife and also one for you, Captain O'Connor. I'll be needing you to help me out with the tactics and navigation.
<br />&quot;We are heading to the New London system and expect to arrive there in four hours. In the mean time, try and get as much rest as you can.&quot;
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Meanwhile in the Magallan system, Michael noticed the Defenders wich were 15k behind him and he thanked the engineer again who increased his scanner range. He engaged his cruise engine and headed for the nearest jumphole.
<br />
<br />He passed Mactan base on the way and he felt the anger boil in his stumach. He could barely resist the urge to turn around and engage the Defenders he saw earlier. Mactan, his home base for the last four years, now nothing more then a piece of rock floating silently in space.
<br />
<br />It took him a few seconds to realise that he had engaged docking sequences and that he was actually docking with Mactan. As the dockingbay doors opened he felt as though he was dreaming. The cilindric airlocks, the sharp right turn and the decent to the landing platform all felt so confident. But there was nobody inside. Nobody ready to rearm, refuel or repair his ship. Nobody ran across the platform and nobody in the controlroom welcomed him home.
<br />
<br />Emotionless he climbed out of his ship and gazed around. Everything was still in order and he could even hear the soft and gentle humming of the stations generators. Michael wondered how long they would hold out. He took the elevator to the fourth level and walked into the bar.
<br />
<br />He got behind the bar and tapped himself a beer. He was glad that the generators also powered the cooling-installation, he didn't like cold beer.
<br />
<br />He walked out of the bar and took the stairs to the fifth level. He turned left and opened the second door on the left. He was home. He sat down on his bed and finished his beer. After that he lay down and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
<br />
<br />Edit: Damn spelling.
<br />
<br />Daft Vader - I am your father.
<br />sS - Noooooooo! I demand a DNA-test.

			<div class="content">The two Stilettoes cut through the blue mist of the Crow Nebula. Inside the cockpit of the lead, the susurrous sounds of the occasional wisps of cloud hitting the ship could occasionally be heard. Unfortunately, that would be if the Bundschuh pilot wasn't getting quite sick of his wingmate's complaining.
<br />
<br />&quot;H.ell, there's never anything out here! Why the h.ell do we have to do these patrols. It's your d.amn fault our shift got moved up.&quot;
<br />&quot;Will you shut up already? I already said I was sorry.&quot;
<br />&quot;When that guy asked you to switch patrol shifts, you could have said no.&quot;
<br />&quot;Did you see the guy? He was huge! That guy would have ripped my head off without breaking a sweat. By hearing what others thought about him, I wouldn't put it past him.&quot;
<br />&quot;So you say.&quot;
<br />&quot;I'm not f.cking lying, okay! Have you even heard of Terranova?&quot;
<br />
<br />During the conversation, a large dark mass appeared in front of the two ships. As the two pilots were used to seeing the battered hulks of Rheinland battleships in the Sigma-13 system, they largely ignored it. It only nibbled away at the edge of the wingman's mind that they were in the Sigma-19 system. Same Crow Nebula, but half a dozen lightyears too far away.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, what the hell is that?&quot;
<br />&quot;Why are you complaining again?&quot;
<br />&quot;I mean it. We're not in the Yanagi field, so why the hell is there a rheinland hulk right there?&quot;
<br />
<br />The next few seconds were unusually long for both pilots, as the truth hit them like the cold on New Berlin. It wasn't a derelict wreck they were seeing. Their thoughts were confirmed as the sensor displays lit up in a sea of red. The battleship was live, and escorted by two squadrons of fighters.
<br />
<br />&quot;S.hit.&quot;
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />Currently, Daniel and Jimmy stood back and looked at their piece of work. To describe it one would only need a single word: Ugly. It was a total disgrace to the Seer . It was almost a disgrace to itself. But it was necessary to do this deed.
<br />It was the wing of a Liberty Patriot fighter, but cut and modified and welded onto the side of a Kusari Dragon fighter. In Psawhn's last battle (the fouth of which to go horribly awry, he thought disturbedly) his port fin was ripped off his ship. As some of the maneuvering thrusters are located on the tips of the stylish wings, the <i>Seer's </i> handling took a severe dive. By attaching the new wing to the ship, Daniel hoped it would restore his agility long enough to make the exodus to Kyoto base in Chugoku. At the Blood Dragon's base he could replace it proper.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's ugly, but It'll work,&quot; said Daniel. 
<br />
<br />Jimmy agreed. &quot;A work of art. And now I'm exhausted. Care for a drink?&quot;
<br />
<br />Daniel could only grunt his reply before starting off to the bar. After making the <i>Cerulean Dream  </i>at least spaceworthy in just over six hours (with the help of several other crewmembers), then spending the last hour and a half fixing up the <i>Seer </i>, of course they would be tired.
<br />
<br />Too bad for him he only made it halfway across the deck when the loud intercomm opened up.
<br />&quot;All pilots report to briefing room. Ground crew get every ship ready for launch. Admiral's orders. That is all.&quot; The ending of the message was marked by several right lights to turn on.
<br />
<br />The message was terse, but immediately almost all noise stopped while its impact registered in the crew's minds. This was serious. After only a moment activity was resumed as all crew started their duties with practised military calm.
<br />
<br />-----------------------
<br />
<br />At first, few of the people in the commops room on the lane hacker Malaga pirate base could discern the unintelligible gibberish that broke through the static.
<br />
<br />&quot;F...  huns... -ot Hans... -ey kay-...  I re-....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Please repeat your statement, over.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;fort-... -tlesh...&quot; Then the lone stiletto broke through the wall of scrambling nebula gases and his signal could travel uninturrupted to Malaga base.
<br />&quot;ship! They got Hans! Forty kay out! F*cking huns! A whole goddam task force of them? Are you even f*cking picking this up? They're headed to your location!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that, patrol leader. You are cleared immediately to docking bay three upon your arrival.&quot;
<br />
<br />The cool message nowhere near reflected the frenzy of activity that had erupted in the control room. Alarms and lights flashed, and orders were shot around like bullets. Their worst fears had come true - the Rheinlanders had appeared before preparations to leave the base had finished. Their time had run out.
<br />
<br />------------
<br />
<br />&quot;...at least one Battleship and two wings of Advanced Valkyries. We doubt that they know the exact wherabouts of Malaga, and we're damned if we're going to let them,&quot; dictated Admiral Evans. He held a stone-hard face developed by years of experience, but nobody in the room had any doubts as to what the general emotion was. &quot;We can guess where they are, however, due to the data we've gotten from the patrol that found them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Gamma and Pi squadrons will launch immediately and give cover to the <i>West Point </i> and <i>Vengeance </i> while we make our way to intercept the battleship. Mu wing, and Echo wing of the <i>Vengeance </i>, will move ahead and try to soften up and distract the fighters before we get there.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hopefully we'll destroy the force quickly enough so they don't get a proper signal out. That would delay reinforcements long enough to complete the evacuation of Malaga. All flights except Mu are dismissed.&quot;
<br />
<br />Daniel started towards the door, but stopped upon realizing he didn't know what to do. He wasn't in the Navy, so obviously he wasn't in any of the squadrons mentioned. It wouldn't be right to barge out there with the rest of them, as military structure is much more formal. But his mind was made up for him as he was called over by the Admiral.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mr. Morlone, since Mu flight is currently missing two wingmen, I would like to ask of your services to temporarily join this wing.&quot; Daniel was taken aback, but quickly resumed his confidence.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh.. certaintly...&quot; Then adding, &quot;sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good, now. Lieutenant Lyta, you are temporarily stated as lead of Mu wing until Captain Quigley recovers. Lieutenants Wolf and Yarlbourgh will be Mu two and three, and Mr. Morlone will take Mu four. Is that clear? Good hunting.&quot;
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />Daniel returned to the <i>Seer </i> to find that it had already been taken care of. The ship was fueled up, and the insignia of Mu flight had been painted on its wings. It was much better service than would have been found on the take-care-of-it-yourself <i>Vengeance. Good thing they thought of filling her up, </i>  Daniel thought. <i>I certainly wouldn't have remembered. </i> Right now he was dead beat. Maybe these military types had learned to cope with hours like these, but Daniel was still relatively new to the hardship.
<br />
<br />Climbing into his cockpit he found a cup of cold coffee inside. <i>Disgusting, </i> he thought, but drank the whole thing down at once anyways. After putting the empty cup away in a compartment, Daniel put on his headset and set the computer to start up. The pre-flight checklist flashed by on his eyepiece while the main HUD, on a holographic panel overtop of his control console, showed the current status of the ship in general. Only seconds later and the whine of the engine starting up could be heard. More information passed by on both the HUD above the console, and on Daniel's eyepiece centimeters away from his right eye. It had taken much training to get used to seeing two separate images in each eye, but it generally proved advantageous.
<br />
<br />After the launch preparations were complete, Psawhn announced this to the controller. &quot;This is Mu Four, requesting clearance for launch.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that, Mu Four. You are cleared for launch.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Outside the ships it was about as hectic as inside. The fighters from the <i>West Point </i> and <i>Vengeance </i> added to the capships and the rest of the rag-tag fleet filled up the region of space quite heavily. Looking at Malaga base, Psawhn could see a Dromedary squeezing itself out of one of the docking bays - the first of the evacuation freighters. His attention was soon drawn to the hail of Rachel Lyta as Mu one.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mu flight, report in.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;One&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Two&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Three&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Four,&quot; Daniel followed suit.
<br />
<br />&quot;Line abreast formation, Two and Three on my left, Four on my right.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger,&quot; each replied.
<br />
<br />The four Mus, which consisted of two Defenders, a Patriot, and a Dragon, engaged cruise. They were closely followed by Echo wing, which consisted of two Anubises from the <i>Vengeance  </i> and four Stilettoes from Malaga. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay, now. I want complete radio silence, and passive scanners only. I'm relaying this to Echo.&quot; Four clicks answered.
<br />
<br />
<br />As he looked around, Psawhn could see the engine flares of Echo flight fade away into a deep blue as they passed into the thicker region of the cloud. They would not likely see anything except the deep, pervading colour until the two wings met up with the battlecruiser. To the former cadets the whole scene brought back painful memories of the New York Badlands. The main difference was that no rockly monoliths hung menacingly about. Were it not for their navigation computers it would be too easy to find yourself lost forever in the ocean of gases surrounding.
<br />
<br />Even without being plagued bymemories, the situation was no worser for Psawhn. He could see now that having the cold coffee was a bad idea. <i>I'll remember that for next time, </i> he thought.

Though I'll have to disagree with your rules Stinger/Wizard, whoever made this. &quot;If your hit your hit&quot; coughCHEEZEcough, if it ever has Player vs Player combat then this is the worst idea possible since someone could come out with X flies at G shoots and kills in one salvo or hits dead on everytime. This gives G no chances to work the plot, no-one likes having their character killed off. And um you might want to create a seperate topic entitled Sign Ups or Character Details, this also gives you space for  OOC and OT posts like this one, it also allows you to accept new members etc until you have an acceptable number and update and expand on your rules. Most forum RPGs NEVER us THAC0. If you want any more advice on running this contact me, I roleplayed quite alot on other forums and it's good to finally see one up and running here. And another point, having *X does this* compared to &quot;X did this&quot; Ie part of the sentence jars it and  breaks up the flow, it's uch more enjoyable to read the latter.

			<div class="content">OOC: Please put all discussions on the topic in the &quot;techy bits&quot; thread. I'll write the response there.
<br />----------------------
<br />Psawhn watched his navmap carefully. It showed the two icons marked by his ship and the estimated Rheinlanders position converging slowly. A small circle was drawn about this position, marking where the Rheinlander's scanners were effective. When inside this circle, Mu flight's passive scanners should pick up the Rheinland battleship's active ones. Daniel assumed the plan was to then head towards the battleship and finally break radio silence when engaging. A simple enough plan in theory. Except that there's the adage that no plan seems to work out perfectly.
<br />
<br />In fact, this plan didn't work out quite as well. Even on passive, Psawhn's scanners kept picking up 'ghosts' all over the place. Of course they were pockets of gases that were slowly reacting, but it still provided an eerie feeling - especialy in the pervading fog. They were extremely dangerous, as well. The flight had to break several times because of a gas cloud that suddenly appeared in front of them. Composed of either hydrogen or oxygen gas, the clouds reacted with the ships' engine flares, resulting in a damaging explosion. Their shields could handle a few hits, but it was a massive beacon that the Rheinlanders would pick up on. 
<br />Psawhn focused back on the navmap. Based on estimates, they should be picking up the battleship about now. Of course the Rheinlanders would need to be actively scanning for the lane hacker base. And a battleship had rather powerful scanners. Psawhn frowned. Why didn't he pick them up?
<br />
<br />Mu squad continued for another minute, before Rachel broke the radio silence. The icons were well past the supposed location of the battleship.
<br />
<br />&quot;One. Okay, then. I suppose this sneaking about doesn't do any good if we're lost. Wolfie, you didn't get anything on those improved scanners of yours?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Not a thing.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine. Go active. See if you can find anything.&quot;
<br />
<br />Daniel watched as the three icons representing the other ships of Mu wing lit up on his navmap display. Daniel followed suit by turning on his own scanners. His navmap changed instantly to reflect the switch, but showed a surprising lack of anything on it. In fact, the only two additions were the markings of several gas pockets and a general fuzziness due to the reflecting gases. The only ships shown were one patriot and two defenders. 
<br />
<br />Strangely enough, that was more unsettling than it should have been. Granted, Mu was lost - but they already knew that. But Psawhn couldn't shake off the crazy feeling that there was more missing from his readout than just the Rheinlanders.
<br />
<br />Wolfie spoke up first. &quot;This is Two. I've got nut'n - 'cept for two dozen gas pockets.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Three here. Ditto for me. But I count twenty seven,&quot; bragged Jimmy.
<br />
<br />&quot;Since when can you find more than me?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Since I punched up the gain in the last five minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Two and three. This is lead. Cut it out. What about you, Four?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I've nothing more to add... but I count thirty one,&quot; Psawhn added with a grin. Then he continued, &quot;How many ships do you have?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Three here. I only have you three.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Something doesn't feel right about that,&quot; Psawhn voiced. <i>What  </i>was<i> wrong with that, </i> he wondered.
<br />
<br />Wolfy figured it out first. &quot;Echo wing.&quot;
<br />
<br />The succinct message had a severe effect on all four of them. Psawhn didn't know how the others felt, but he sure knew that he felt like that cold coffee had decided to rebel against his stomach. They had lost Echo wing in the mist. At best, Echo were as lost as they were. The other situation was that Echo had already engaged the Rheinlanders, and being horribly outnumbered as they were it would not fare well.
<br />
<br />&quot;Flight, lead. Let's head back and hope we pick up something.&quot; As a group, the fighters gracefully arced around and headed the direction they came. Psawhn kept one eye trained on his scanners, and the other normally piloting and looking around. With his headset on, this was quite literally possible.
<br />
<br />After several minutes, however, the constant alert became tiring. Psawhn amused himself by counting the ratio of Hydrogen, Helium, and Oxygen gas pockets scattered around. <i> That's forty oxygen... fifty two hydrogen... thirty six helium... that one makes forty nine hydrogen... heh, look. A water pocket... Water pocket? </i> Water is the result of oxygen and hydrogen burning. They would occur in a gas pocket field like this after one of the gas pockets exploded, and that probably mean a ship passed by recently.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lead, this is four. I think I've got something at oh-seven-five degrees.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger, four. Mu flight, turn to oh-seven-five degrees. Four, what do you have?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;An exploded water pocket - I mean, exploded gas that resulted in a water pocket. Means a ship passed by recently.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It would be a battleship,&quot; Rachel inferred. &quot;A fighter would just fly around it. Are there any other pockets?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Just one. Bearing three-twenty degrees.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that. Mu flight, adjust course.&quot; The wing followed the path of frozen ice crystals like a birds following a path of breadcrumbs. <i>Finally, we're getting somewhere, </i> thought Rachel.
<br />
<br />Soon enough, Psawhn's scanners caught a blip of energy dead ahead. It must have been another oxygen pocket exploding.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're catching up,&quot; he announced. Then his scanners caught another flash of energy. It was much too soon to be another gas pocket. Another bit of energy. Only one thing explains this, he thought. We're too late - the fight's started without us!
<br />
<br />OOC: The previous post by me has also been updated a teensy bit, in case you guys are wondering.

<br />*****************************************************************************************
<br />
<br />Lutz sat in the bar alone. He had a large cup of steaming hot coffee infront of him and pondered as he warmed his hands at the cup. He had learned through extensive training to do with very little sleep and had needed only a few hours, but Alys needed her sleep so Lutz had gone to the bar as soon as he woke up. Now he somehow wished he would have stayed with her. He felt alone and obviously thought about Michael as he let his mind go over the events on Manhattan. He didn't notice O'Connor walking up to him and he scared up from his thoughts as the Captain pulled the chair from under the table and sat down.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, I'm sorry Lutz. You mind if I join you?&quot;
<br />&quot;Of course not Roger, sit down. Do you want a cup of coffee?&quot;
<br />&quot;Is it any good?&quot; O'Connor asked. He knew the reputation of Libertonian coffee was even more illustrious then Liberty Ale.
<br />&quot;No.&quot; Lutz confirmed his suspicions. &quot;But it will wake you up.&quot;
<br />&quot;Very well.&quot; said O'Conner and Lutz ordered another coffee.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, how are you?&quot; O'Connor asked.
<br />&quot;I'm glad I got some rest. I get a fealing I'm gonna need it.&quot;
<br />&quot;Thats not realy what I meant, Lutz.&quot; O'Conor had a more serious look on his face then he ever had before. Lutz sighed.
<br />&quot;I know what you mean Roger, but i can't sit here and worry about someone who's probably dead while there are so many othere things to worry about.&quot;
<br />&quot;How can you say that?&quot; O'Connor asked, surprised and shocked by Lutz' cold and determined reaction.
<br />&quot;How can you say that? You don't know if he's dead. For all we know, he could be alive and inside scanner range as we speak.&quot;
<br />&quot;Oh comon, do you realy believe that? There's no way anyone could have made it out of there alive. Even a pilot of Michaels caliber and you know that just as I do.&quot;
<br />&quot;But that's no excuse to dismiss him like an old commset that has gone bust. He's your friend, you can't just wipe him from your thoughts.&quot;
<br />&quot;But I have to. Don't you understand?&quot; Lutz raised his voice and stood up, knocking over the chair. O'Connor, scared by the sudden violence in Lutz looked up to him.
<br />&quot;I HAVE to erase him from my mind, because if I don't I go insane and I have too many other things on my head to risk that. I gotta take care of Alys, I gotta run the leftovers of the defending fleet, I've got this freaking huge gun on my ship capable of distroying battleships and bases in the blink of an eye, I've been on the run for the last three months straight and we're being chased by a superior force of inhuman fighters and battleships. I am this far from a nervous breakdown, so excuse me for taking some f*cking time for myself, trying to forget the latest drawback I had to endure.&quot;
<br />
<br />O'Conner stared at Lutz who was walking in circles through the bar. The only other person present, the bartender, had gone to the kitchen so they were practically alone. Lutz knocked over a chair in anger and barged to the exit.
<br />&quot;Lutz! Wait, please.&quot; Lutz halted and O'Connor desperatly thought of something to say.
<br />&quot;The coffee, it's drinkable now. Come and sit down.&quot; O'Connor pleaded. Lutz hessitated, but then he turned around and walked back to the table and sat down. He took a sip of his coffee and his face wrenched as he swallowed it.
<br />&quot;Liar, this coffee will never be drinkable.&quot;
<br />They both smiled and then started to laugh and the bartender, unaware of all that had happened, wondered if they were still drunk.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />As the Arizona  gracefuly glided through Brettonian space on it's way to the New London system, a lone freelancer woke up and wondered where he was. He didn't recognise the light and felt disorientated. He expected to see the pale, bright standard brigglights burning out his eyes as he opened them, but the light he saw was warmer and moving. He rubbed his hands across his face to open his eyes better and yawned. He realised that the light wasn't moving, but was actually flickering. He looked across the room and saw a burning candle on the far side of the room, standing on a table. Michael just realised that there weren't any candles on Mactan as he saw a dark figure sitting in the corner next to the table. Alerted by this, he quickly rose to his feet and prepared to fight. But he just as quickly regreted his action as a splitting headache anounced a long day of recovering from to much beer and all blood pulled away from his head from getting up to fast. He fell back on his bed and accepted his fate; The Rheinlanders had finaly found him and now they were going to kill him. Patiently Michael waited for the inevitable, which never came. instead, a gentle voice spoke to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, I'm glad to see you're awake. Get up, we have a lot of work to do.&quot;
<br />
<br />He somehow recognised the voice, but couldn't place it and blamed it on the hangover. In a strange way the voice comforted him and he opened his eyes again. This time he calmly sat up straight on his bed and was glad the headache was reduced to a slumbering, soft drilling in the back of his head. But he knew it would only be temporarily. The headaches always returned.
<br />
<br />The figure in the corner stood up and walked over to him. he realised it was a woman as she crouched down at his side. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Good to have you back with us again Michael.&quot; she said. &quot;For a while there I thought you'd sleep forever.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The light of the candle flashed briefly in her eyes as she smiled. He could see she was pretty, but her eyes, or what he could see of them in the faint candle light seemed everything but friendly and for that one second Michael knew she was going to kill him.
<br />He quickly shook that image out of his head and tried to get a better look.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who are you?&quot; Michael asked.
<br />&quot;Don't you recognise me?&quot; She asked. &quot;It has only been two years ago.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael looked closer and then noticed the mark above her right eyebrow, just below her hairline. A cold chill crawled up his spine as he realised that she might very well be the woman he once flew with for a long time, and they did a lot more then just flying together. But he was still in the navy back then and there was every possibility that she still was. He looked at her shoulders and noticed the extra bar on her shoulder patch, meaning she was a Commander. But the insignia on her chest was different then the one he had worn. His had been an eagle streching its wings over the mountains, but the one this woman was wearing only had two flashing, catlike eyes in the darkness and in a flash he could see her reach for her gun and point it at him. Damn beer , Michael thought and felt silly for drinking this much when so much was at stake.
<br />
<br />She got up before he could have a good look and turned away to the door. Michael streched up. Fearing she would leave he wanted to speak, but his mouth was to dry and he could only produce a whispery blurr of words.
<br />Suddenly the much feared brigglights flashed up and Michael covered his eyes with his hands. As they addapted to the slightly cruel intensity of the light, her figure became clearer and all the memories came back.
<br />
<br />&quot;Have you come to arrest me, Anna?&quot; Michael was a bit surprised by his own calm reaction, but Anna's reaction surprised him even more; &quot;I've come to have breakfast with you. Come, it'll be like old times again.&quot;
<br />
<br />And she left for the bar, but not before peaking sensually over her shoulder as she turned the corner.
<br />Michael was left behind in confusion. She was still in the navy, he was almost absolutely sure of that, but why didn't she arrest or kill him? She had every oportunity to do so, but she wanted to have breakfast with him instead. Could she be a Loyalist? Michael wasn't sure. He wasn't even sure if he wanted her to be a loyalist. Sure, she was an able pilot and had the right attitude, her decorations proved that, but irony had it that she had also testified against him before the Court Marshall which eventually put him in this dillemma. Finaly he made up his mind; Screw irony  he thought and he got out of bed.
<br />
<br />Fifteen minutes later he walked into the bar where he saw a plate of scrambled eggs with bacon, some saussages and a big jar of greenage juice ready on a table; His favourite breakfast. Anna sat on the other end of the table and waved him over.
<br />
<br />&quot;Doesn't it smell great?&quot; she said and Michael reluctantly admitted that it did. It even tasted great and for the first time in weeks, or even months he felt totally satisfied after a meal. They both hadn't spoken a word while Michael was eating, but now he was finished, he had some questions. Anna beat him to it.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, how are you doing?&quot;
<br />
<br />That totally blew him away. The whole station was abandoned, the four Houses where at war and she was partially responsible for the fact that he was in this mess and she wanted to know how he was doing?
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, good actually. Concidering there's a war going on and all.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yeah, isn't it terrible? So how did you end up here?&quot;
<br />&quot;I flew in yesterday. I wanted to pick up some stuff I had laying aound.&quot; Michael somewhat evaded the question as he couldn't tell her the whole story. He still didn't know what side she was on.
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you all alone here?&quot; She asked him.
<br />
<br />Michael wanted to answer, but hessitated as he began to realise that something was very wrong. She was stalling time by asking him non-relevant questions. But why? Sudenly he noticed a figure in the reflection of his glass of juice and turned around. There was a man behind him who reached for his gun. Michael reacted surprisingly quick despite his hangover and got up, knocked over a table and crouched behind it. He reached for his gun and yelled to Anna to get down on the ground. He reached again twice before he realised he only caught an empty holster. Confused he looked at Anna to see if she had taken cover. But Anna was still sitting at the table.
<br />
<br />&quot;Anna, get down, this guy's got a gun!&quot; Then he saw why Anna hadn't taken cover and all hope was drowned away with the sweat now pooring down his shirt; She had a gun pointed at him, his own gun.
<br />Slowly Michael got up and walked over to her.
<br />
<br />&quot;Give me the gun Anna.&quot; But gefore he could reach her he felt the room starting to spin. At first he thought it was the hangover, but when he saw the look on Anna's face he knew it must have been the food. He lost his balance and fell to the floor. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Why?&quot; He asked, streching out his hand to Anna before passing out.

<br />&quot;Hurry up and join in, then. We're way outnumbered here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that. Mu flight: engage at will!&quot;
<br />
<br />It happened that just then Mu flight broke into a small clearing in the clouds, revealing to them the battle unfolding in front of them. It was, to put it mildly, quite a shock. Erupting into existence directly before his eyes was the sight of the massive behemoth of a Rheinland Battlecruiser. Psawhn let out an inaudible gasp as his contact list lit up. It showed ten advanced Valkyries, plus a fully decked Rheinland Battleship. On the friendly side, he picked up two Anubises and a trio of Stilettoes. <i>Damn, we're too late for one of them </i>, Daniel thought.
<br />Still half a minute away, He surveyed the scene. Eraser and the other Anubis pilot were doing all right on their own, however the three stilettoes, packed together tightly, weren't faring so well. Half a dozen of the a-valks were on their tail. Furrowing his eyebrows, Psawhn targetted the nearest of that group and hit his thrusters.
<br />
<br />The resulting force jarred him backwards, and Daniel heard his neck give out a small crack in protest. <i>I'm getting sloppy, </i> he told himself, <i>but no time for that now. </i> He watched the distance counter wind down, and mentally counted until he was in weapons range. <i>Thousand metres... nine hundred... eight hundred. Time to test out this debilitator. </i> Psawhn pressed down on his weapons trigger.
<br />
<br />He was startled to see three other streams of energy fire lance out towards the same target. Looking behind, he saw that the rest of Mu was still in formation, and were firing together on the same target. <i>Great minds think alike, </i> he thought. The enemy Valkyrie was caught completely off guard, and the combined weapons fire wilted its shields in an instant. The couldn't even try to pull away before four pairs of missiles slammed into the hull and exploded, completely engulfing the Valkyrie in a ball of flame. The pilot never had a chance to eject, as the entire ordeal was over in less than a second.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whoops, that was a bit overkill,&quot; remarked Jimmy.
<br />
<br />Tagging the rest of the group wouldn't be so easy, however. The five remaining Valkyries broke off and easily avoided the redispersed fire of Mu wing. But instead of turning to face the group, the four valks which were under fire merely focused their efforts on the evasion. Stalling for time. Psawhn recognized this and gave a warning.
<br />
<br />&quot;Flight! Watch your sixes!&quot;
<br />
<br />Psawhn sent the ship spiralling off to the right, and saw a bright glow in the corner of his eye where a multitude of hornvipers overlapped where the <i>Seer </i> was a second ago. He blessed the jerry-rigged wing currently mounted onto his port side - without it the seer would never had moved out of the way soon enough. Psawhn launched a mine, then cut thrust and turned around. The A-Valk, which had broken off from pursuing Echo Two, was forced to dodge the mine and couldn't target Daniel in that moment of vunerability. Psawhn reengaged his engines and let loose his guns. His new advanced debilitator started to tear through the valk's shields, but then he almost lost sight of it as the Rheinlander pulled off a sudden evasion. Psawhn's Dragon was still much more agile however, even with the fake wing. With the help of his neuralnet targetting, he kept dogging the A-Valk and finished it off with a catapult missile. <i>Scratch one for me, </i> he announced triumphantly to himself. <i>Let's hope I don't mess this up like I've been doing lately. </i>
<br />
<br />He put it out of his mind as he looked back on his contact list. Daniel saw that two other Valkyries had been destroyed. He looked out of his window to catch another become consumed by green flame. So far, it seemed to be going well.
<br />
<br />Then he was jarred violently as a blue glow invaded his cockpit. The lights and control panels flickered severely, and the icy voice of his neuralnet camly informed him that his shields had failed. Following instinct, Psawhn immediately put the <i>Seer </i> into a hard roll and dive, and set shield batteries to restore power immediately. Normally he would have the shield batteries gradually restore power, which produced much less strain on the systems, and it seemed to lose a bit less energy in the process. But Psawhn guessed that he had just been the victim of a <i>stormblade </i> assault, and he didn't know whether or not the enemy had any <i>fireblades </i> in their arsenal. His question was soon answered as a crimson light engulfed his view. Luckily for him the fighter-mounted weapon had no effect on his freshly restored shields.
<br />
<br />The <i>Seer </i> swung around and fired its weapons into the offending Advanced Valkyrie. Since the valk was recovering from using its primary weapon, it offered no resistance and soon collapsed under Psawhn's lethal energy fire.
<br />
<br />Then again he was caught off guard by an invading blue glare and every system on the ship simultaneously going haywire. Apparantly the stormblade user was still out there. This time Psawhn only cached in enough shield capacitor energy to jumpstart his shield generator, not to completly restore it. No use in burning out half his systems, he thought. Then he looked for the culprit of the last attack, and to his surprise there were no nearby Valkyries to have fired that shot. <i>Where is it coming from?[i he asked himself.
<br />
<br />&quot;Jeez, Psawhn!&quot; yelled Eraser, as if in answer. &quot;That fire's coming from the battleship. Get away from it!&quot;
<br />
<br />Whoops. Psawhn berated himself for not paying enough attention to his surroundings. Luckily for him none of the battleship's main turrets scored hits. Flying out of range of the behemoth, he again looked for the nearest enemy. The three remaining Advanced Valkyries were being taken care of easily. Now Daniel began to wonder where the [iWest point </i> and <i>Vengeance </i> were. He dismissed it, thinking that they probably can't find the battle location. <i>Maybe we can take out the battleship without the cruisers, </i> Daniel wondered. It was certainly possible, as a couple other ships had torpedoes mounted.
<br />
<br />Daniel idly watched two of the other Valkryies explode under the rain of weapons fire, and the third soon after. The space was now completely devoid of and Rheinland ships save the battleship itself, which was currently trying to flee as fast as the gigantic form could. It was definitely unsuccessful, as a combined torpedo run on its engines crippled the ship and left it hanging. The only thing the fighters could then do was wait for the cruisers to show up. Daniel realized that they didn't possibly have nearly enough torpedoes to destroy the ship itself.
<br />
<br />After the intense rush of combat, it didn't seem too long for both the <i>Vengeance </i> and <i>West point </i> to pop out from the steely mists.
<br />
<br />&quot;Apologies for being late,&quot; declared Admiral Evans. &quot;We got holed up in the gas fields.&quot;
<br />
<br />Probably seeing their imminent doom with the arrival of the cruisers, the comm officer of the Rheinland battleship spoke up on their channel.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the RNC <i>Donnersturm. </i> We surrender.&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />Johnson had spent most of his time in the bar thinking of everything that had happened. The euphoria of the Arizona's  triumphant procession into Bretonia conflicted with the gloom of his home's destruction. Although he should have been thoroughly joyed that the criminals had made such an embarassment of the Houses, who outnumbered and outgunned the criminals by a considerable margin, Johnson couldn't bring himself to celebrate. He had for a moment, but then reality set in.
<br />
<br />The Arizona  still had to make its way through Bretonia, to get to wherever the hell they were trying to get. Johnson was pretty confident that the Bretonian Parliament wouldn't give a ship full of weakened common criminals free passage to the Tau systems. So the captain of the ship would have to bargain or fight his way through, or surrender. Fighting, after that battle, was not an option. Nor was surrender; the criminals were far too proud for that. But what was there to bargain with? They were stuck in the proverbial rock and a hard place.
<br />
<br />Conflicts aboard the Arizona  itself had to be consolidated, or else the criminals might be lying in pools of their own blood. Everyone was on edge. With the destruction of their ancestral homes, and conflicts between themselves, the captain and everyone else were tightwalking a thin and fragile line. To Johnson personally, he was glad he had his two pistols by his side, and his stolen rifle strapped on his back. Already emotional criminals put through inhuman stress was not something that should be treaded through unarmed.
<br />
<br />Johnson thought about the big picture. He thought of Malaga Base, and what it possibly could be going through. Maybe it was already being beseiged by a coalition of Rheinlanders and Libertonians. Maybe it had escaped silently and without trouble. Maybe they were still there, gathering all the refugees they could take. Johnson concluded that ignorance was not bliss, but anxiety.
<br />
<br />Johnson took a drink of the legendary but sufficiently unsatisfactory Liberty Ale. Drowning the problems didn't seem to help much, but only made it all the more fuzzy. Johnson looked at his wrist. The time is--,   he thought, oh wait, I don't have a watch on that arm. I must be drunk.  Johnson decided that he'd make himself useful and walk out. Useful at what, though, he hadn't decided.
<br />
<br />He stumbled out of the bar and collapsed on the hard grating, perhaps out of intoxication, perhaps out of pure exhaustion. But he began nodding off<b>, and soon fell asleep. He woke up, but he didn't know how much time had passed since he had slept. A recognizable figure walked out of the bar, without recognizing himself. Hey, it's Lutz! he thought. With that he fell into a deep slumber again.  </b>
<br />
<br />OOC: Turned out to be easier than I thought.

			<div class="content">Roger hadn't had one such serious thinking since he was doing final exams at university of Tartuensis. He was currently working out a plan of action for the war with the Captain of <i>Arizona </i> - Breuer, Walker and couple of officers. 
<br />&quot;We can't just barge and hope for them to let us go, after all most of us here are wanted criminals.&quot; Walker shouted
<br />Breuer looked at him and told calmly &quot;But they must know the political situation currently developing, Bretonia government would not leave us unprotected!&quot;
<br />&quot;Why would it protect wanted criminals? It might just kill us to gain favor with the Rheinalnd!&quot;
<br />O'Connor looked up from the Sirius system map &quot;They won't attack us because Kursari is still neutral, but they can leave us unprotected.&quot;
<br />Walker was clearly upset about what was happened here and a little cranky because he was forced to be in the sickbay. &quot;I hate the politics! I guess that Kursari makes its decision of sides when Bretonia does and vice versa?&quot; he said.
<br />Roger was totally ignoring what Walker said and continued: &quot;In my thinking, we should establish our stronghold in some bordersystem, like Dublin for example. Or in some major system like New London, tho they won't be as easly defended. From Dublin we can pick up all amounts of criminals and freelancers alike that are against the Liberty-Rhineland regime while we wait for <i>West Point </i> and <i>Vengeance </i>.&quot;
<br />&quot;How the hell do you plan to get some random criminals joining this suicide resistance of ours?&quot; Breuer asked.
<br />&quot;In theory criminal organizations always had much more underground then any of the officials could prove so they are bound to have some connections to some of those criminals who have connections to the next and so on, all we got to do is let the crew convince as much people as possible to join us in our last stronghold.&quot;
<br />Still skeptical Breuer wasn't quite convinced &quot;So far so good, but what about the house military? Won't they act against us when we do so?&quot;
<br />&quot;I will deal with Bretonia and I can guarantee that they will join us, Kursari couldn't back us up with nothing more than a political word and they will do that even without persuading, because of all those Liberty ships there.&quot;
<br />&quot;Fairly good plan, but hear mine too. I suggest we move fast to Tau-s and then Omicron Alpha from there we can go to Omicron Theta and be in the backyard of the enemy, they won't know where to look for us and since there is a heavy presence of pirate factions there they wouldn't dare to enter those unexplored areas. And when Bretonians distract them we can go in through Omegas and Dresden, here&quot; *he points to a location on the map* &quot;As Mr. Walsh said Liberty lines are thin so we hope that Rheinlander's are as well, we could seize the planet New Berlin docking ring to us and ask for disbandment of the newly forged alliance or we will bombard the planet surface. While that group is stalling Rheinlanders we have another small group sneaks up on their shipyards and other vital points and launches a devastating attack.&quot; Walker said that with so much anger against the Rheinlanders that it was questionable weather he isn't doing this on personal revenge. But this wasn't the time nor was it the place to discuss that, all they knew that Walker was a good soldier and right now they were in dire need of good soldiers.
<br />&quot;And then what?&quot; Breuer asked
<br />&quot;Then I'm dead, and thus I need not to think further&quot; Walker chuckled
<br />O'Connor agreed that it was otherwise a good plan but there was one problem to it: &quot;What if Rheinlanders don't argue with you and actually LET you bombard the planet surface? I mean if there weren't any casualties then it would be a great political move to disgrace us.&quot;
<br />&quot;Its their capital, how do they not defend it? They would loose thousands of citizens!&quot;
<br />&quot;And what would we get by killing their citizens? Except hatred of everybody Whose friends and\or family we killed. Won't they become just be blinded by the revenge and join Rheinland forces?&quot;
<br />&quot;Well... I... You might be right bu what about public anger against the government for not defending them? How's that for a reason? And I believe that those who will join navy will do it fine without our provocation.&quot;
<br />&quot;The latest data we have received shows that public is already angry with them and they just ignore everything except this war. The last protest was forced down by killing over 300 protesters, others fled in terror.&quot;
<br />Breuer now said a word in edgewise: &quot;Lets not kill each other here, ok? Your both plans are good up to a point, but what about combining those? We can use Captain O'Connor's contact with the Bretonia...&quot;
<br />All three men argue for another hour and half while other officers are quietly listening afraid to say something. About then <i>Arizona </i> made it to New London - their safe heaven for a while.
<br />
<br />--------------
<br />
<br />O'Connor was walking to his quarters thinking weather he should ask a doctor or an mechanic to remove that metal plate on his hand. He had forgotten about it when fighting for his survival. Or at least that was what he was trying to think, because he tried to take Lutz' advice but thoughts about Michael stormed in his head. Roger was hating the situation he was in, he was hating the unknown. <i>&quot;This is the last time I try to save the world.&quot; </i> he said to himself as he was passing the med lab. O'Connor stepped in to see a total mess: wounded everywhere, doctors and other medical personell jogging around the place with syringes and condition analyzers in hand, blood on the floor, pieces of metal and shrapnel in small bowls throughout the med center. &quot;Is here anybody who can help me with this metal thingy?&quot; Roger yelled showing his arm. One of the more able patients told him that doc is busy with a pilot right now, but he should complete that operation soon.
<br />
<br />Few minutes later the doctor came to med lab from operation room with two men carrying a body, it was Arrigoni. As soon as O'Connor noticed that he asked the doctor if he was still alive. &quot;Yes, we just finished the surgery, he will be fine. Do you know him?&quot; &quot;Somewhat&quot; was Roger's answer &quot;But why did you operate now he could of died in the meantime?&quot; he added after a small pause. &quot;He was in stable enough situation to bear with us, there were others, more serious cases that needed our urgent attention. Besides I wouldn't of risked operating during a firefight - every movement of the ship can prove fatal to the patient. Luckily this was only an easy operation to remove a piece of metal that had pierced his body, like I said nothing serious.&quot; Roger felt a lot happier and left sickbay thanking the doctor for the good news. He remembered his arm when he passed the magnet near the command bridge again, but O'Connor decided not to go back there before other who actually need their treatment get it. When Roger reached his quarters he felt how tired he really was, he laid down on the bed and fell asleep almost instantly with his last thoughts being of the<i>Vengeance </i>...

			<div class="content">(OOC: Ladida. Took a while, sorry. Turned out I already had this...)
<br />
<br />On the bridge of the Arizona  Breuer, Walker and President Washington looked at the giant map, projected on a glass sheet. It was an old technology, but it still worked. Methods of Holographic projection weren't available yet, but rumours had it that Kusarian engineers had made a breakthrough on this field. It wasn't actually relevant at this time, but it flashed through Walkers mind ever since he saw the map.
<br />Various blips, lines and dots resembled planets, bases, known jumpholes, tradelanes and known patrolpaths.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, what's the plan? Are we just gonna sneak up on them?&quot; Walker felt to much hessitation and his commanding roots wanted to take over.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we have to make contact at some point, we better move quickly.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I agree,&quot; said the president, &quot;time is of the escence here and there's not much left.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Walker said, &quot;I think we should announce our pressence to the Bretonians. Who knows what they'll do to us when they find us sneaking into their capital system.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, I don't think they will start a fight and certainly not in New London. They might think it's a distraction or something. Staying here only delays us even further. The invasion could begin literaly any moment now.&quot; Breuer had proven himself a worthy captain, but unfortunately he didn't know anything about tactics.
<br />
<br />&quot;Look, I understand fully what we're dealing with,&quot; Walker reasoned, &quot;but it's no reason to start panicking. When the invasion begins, we'll be here to stop it. Don't forget we've got those big ass guns on this Battleship and we've destroyed two Liberty Battleships already. With the Bretonian forces in this system we should be able to hold them back.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, and we lost nearly all our fighters and have endured two major hull breaches in the proces. Comon, do you realy think...&quot; But the president interrupted them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Gentlemen, please. This is hardly the time to argue. I think Mister Walker has a good point here. We need to let the Bretonian forces know we are here otherwise they might act prematurely and perhaps destroy us.&quot;
<br />
<br />It took Breuer a moment before he could speak; He was a proud man and being corrected by the president of Liberty, who was technically no president anymore, in front of his crew hurt his ego. But if he was just half as clever as Walker hoped he was, Breuer would make the right desicion.
<br />
<br />Breuer turned to his crew, but they would never find out what Breuers desicions was, as the communications officer had made it for them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, I have an incomming transmission on the public chanel. It's coming from a Bretionian Battleship.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What's it's position and heading?&quot; Breuer asked to his navigations officer. The Bretonian battleship hadn't shown up on the map because the Arizona  wasn't using it's active scanners, meaning it couldn't detect anything mobile if it couldn't detect them. A new silent dot on the map told them rather late about the new contact. Walker knew that this crew still needed a lot of practice
<br />
<br />&quot;Distance 15k, heading 3-5-0. It's heading straight for us, sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;On speakers.&quot; Breuer ordered and the comunications officer pathced the incoming call through to the bridge speakers and they could hear the distinguished voice of a Bretonian Captain.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is captain mcCall of the Brettonian Battleship the Royalty  to Liberty Dreadnaught. cut your engines and prepare to be boarded. Failure to comply will result in your iminent destruction. You have ten seconds to comply.&quot;
<br />
<br />Breuer responded quickly. &quot;This is captain Ralph Breuer of the rogue Battleship the Arizona . We are not part of the Liberty fleet and have come here to seek refuge.&quot;
<br />
<br />After a short moment of silence the Bretonian captain responded. &quot;And how do we know you're not lying?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I can assure you we have no bad intentions. Our entire crew consists of Junkers and defected navy pilots. In fact, we have the Liberty President with us. Now, you know he's been overthrown and some guys present here have rescued him from LPI sugarland. We had to flee from Liberty and since this was the only save place left to go to...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Show me the president. Bring him over to the Royalty , then we'll talk. I'll give you ten minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;He closed the chanel, sir.&quot; said the comm oficer.
<br />
<br />&quot;Very well. Mister president, you can't go alone.&quot; Said Breuer.
<br />
<br />&quot;I agree,&quot; Walker added, &quot;I'm coming along, sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And so am I.&quot; From the door of the bridge, Lutz came walking up to them. He had a determined look on his face as he walked up to the men with O'Connor right behind him.
<br />
<br />Great  Walker thought, More captains on this ship .
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you sure, Lutz?&quot; Walker asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, why not, two men can do more then one.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good,&quot; Breuer said, &quot;you two escort the President to the Royalty . Good luck.&quot;
<br />
<br />Yeah, sure.  Walker thought as they walked away to the dockingbay. He somehow disliked this Breuer. It might be because he was a Junker. He wasn't sure, but he didn't like him.
<br />
<br />Walker's grudges against Breuer were forgotten as soon as they were in space. He and Lutz were formed on either side of the President, who had been given one of the Defenders. The ship had been set to autopilot, because the President had never piloted a ship before and although it's not realy dificult to learn, they simply didn't have the time to go through all the initial procedures and basic flight systems.
<br />
<br />The autodock led them into the belly of the gigantic Battleship, which in a way resembled a grasshopper. At least, that's what Walker always thought. Inside the ship didn't look all that different from a Liberty Dreadnought and for a moment it almost seemed as though they were landing on the Arizona  again. The landingpad, filled with guards holding all kinds of rifles and guns quickly brought him back to reality. They were have to tread lightly. They might have the president, but Walker knew Bretonians wouldn't simply take anyones word, especially in these kind of situations.
<br />
<br />The hoods of the three ships opened simultaniously and they carefully stepped out onto the deck, where they were immediately searched for weapons and taken away. They went through several doors, down a few halls until they finaly halted infront of an impressive massive wooden door. One of the guards knocked and opened the door. They all stepped into the room which was brightly lit. At the end of the room stood a desk which was just as impressive as the door they just opened. Behind it stood a man, obviously the Captain, who was inspecting a large map of the Sirius sector. The Captain waved without looking around and the guards left the room. Lutz, Walker, the president and the captain were now alone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Rheinland forces have defeated the Kusari Naval forces and are on their way to the Leeds system. We expect them at our doorsteps in less then 50 standard hours. Liberty is holding position at our borders for over 150 standard hours now. Intell informs us that both nations have enough recources to fight for at least six to nine standard months, which is aproximately six to nine times more then we can.&quot;
<br />
<br />The captain finaly turned around and looked at his 'visitors'. He frowned a bit and then walked around his desk and aproached the men.
<br />
<br />&quot;I just recieved word from a reliable source that <b>King Wendel </b> is strongly concidering the option to surrender and he would save many lives if he did. Basically, mister president, we're screwed. And then you show up on our scanners. Can you imagine the upheaval it caused?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I can only guess.&quot; Said the President. &quot;We're very sorry for the disturbance, Captain and we realise that a Liberty Dreadnaught isn't the best desguise for a few runaway naval pilots, some rebelling pirates and a president, but it's all we've got and it helped us get this far.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm surprised you managed to get into Bretonian space undetected.&quot; said the captain and he looked at Lutz and Walker.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's my escort.&quot; Washington explained with a smile, &quot;Lutz walsh and Stephen Walker, two very able pilots who both have done their share in fighting the enemy.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Clever decision. Now tell me,&quot; the captain said, as he poored foor glasses of New London whiskey and offered them a seat, &quot;how in the devils name did you get that Battleship in the first place?&quot;
<br />
