			<div class="content">Howdy everyone. This is my first post. I'd thought I'd share some of my thoughts after playing the PR Beta that arrived in my store this last 
<br />
<br />week.
<br />
<br />Chris Roberts' hands were certainly upon this game. You can feel that from the way you interact with people, the ship designs, and some of the 
<br />
<br />basic game mechanics. From the first moment I began to play this game, it screamed Privateer. Not that second one, mind you, but the original. 
<br />
<br />The one that captured me for countless hours of gaming delight. Freelancer provides a living breathing universe that is a pleasure to explore 
<br />
<br />and be a part of.
<br />
<br />Even though this is a beta, and obviously not a finished product, I'd like to go ahead and just list some of the things I felt lacking. Note 
<br />
<br />again, this is from a BETA product, and a vast majority of my experience has been from the multiplayer.
<br />
<br />Wish List
<br />------------
<br />1. More communication options with AI
<br />    L  Those of you that played Privateer might know what I'm talking about.
<br />           You could talk through a list of preset radio commands. You could 
<br />           just ask them about their mission, or even threaten them into 
<br />           dropping their cargo. The only thing you can do to an AI ship in the 
<br />           beta is hail them. They'll say what their designation is, where they're 
<br />           from, where they're going, and their mission. That's fine but I'd like 
<br />           some more interaction there.
<br />2. Fewer random encounters
<br />    L  This is mainly from the MP experience because I've noticed that these 
<br />           random encounters are much less common in the single player. It's 
<br />           hard to make a living as a scrapper in a transport when you have to 
<br />           constantly battle rogues, junkers, xenos, etc etc... I understand that 
<br />           some career paths can be dangerous, but it seems like I'm running into 
<br />           hordes of people even in the most remote of debri fields.
<br />3. Accents *TOTAL WISH!!*
<br />    L  COMPLETE WISH!!!! Yeah it's not possible to implement now. It would 
<br />           have demanded countless more hours in the voice talent section and 
<br />           created a headache for the coders, but I just wish there was more 
<br />           tangible transitions from one system to another. I want Rheinlanders 
<br />           to replace W's with V's and the Brits to speak with that stiff upper lip 
<br />           and so forth. You can't deny that it would be a nice touch, but I 
<br />           don't think the game is any less for not having it.
<br />4. Easier to outfit larger ships
<br />    L  I've been flying around in a Rheinlander Humpback (or Hunchback? eh can't 
<br />           remember) and it's mighty frustrating trying to place particular turrets 
<br />           exactly where I want them. The interface is directly on top of the ship 
<br />           when you're in the equipment facility, so you have to remove a turret, 
<br />           exit the menu, change camera angles several times and try and see 
<br />           where you are now missing a turret. Perhaps simply putting a note on 
<br />           the weapon slot as to it's position on the vehicle. Like so
<br />           ----------------------------------
<br />          /Weapon Name (Class)          /
<br />          /type/max class (*position*)  /
<br />           ----------------------------------
<br />           Positions would be like (top-front), (bottom-front), (side-front), etc...
<br />

<br />
<br />5. Camera Tracking/Ship Control
<br />    L  This one could be a balancing issue though. My friend usually plays the 
<br />          fighter/escort role and I hold the freight. Problem is, the turret camera 
<br />          is extremely difficult to manage in combat. My guns are powerful, 
<br />          assuming I can bring them to bare on a target. Often combat can 
<br />          become a dizzying battle against motion sickness, camera restrictions, 
<br />          and switching between turret and pilot to get back into range of the 
<br />          target. While managing a massive freighter SHOULD be difficult in 
<br />          combat, I wish there were either one of two features to aid:
<br />            L   A. Target camera tracking in turret view that would allow the 
<br />                        camera to auto fix on a target, follow it until the player unlocks 
<br />                        or target is killed. The mouse flight lock via the space bar 
<br />                        is much to sensitive so often times you find yourself constantly 
<br />                        correcting for an over active mouse. If there was a sensitivity 
<br />                        adjustment for turret's, that would help.
<br />                 B.  If there was also a way to control the ship movement while 
<br />                        in turret mode, that would certainly add to the effectiveness 
<br />                        of this type of ship in combat. Most of the time I get into 
<br />                        combat, my friend engages, and I'm trying to get within 
<br />                        firing range of the enemies. It's not that the ship isn't fast 
<br />                        enough, it's that I can only speed up, slow down, and strafe 
<br />                        while in turret mode. If the battle is below or above me, I'm 
<br />                        forced to switch back into the driver's seat, exposing me to 
<br />                        enemy fire while I try and realign with the targets. Very 
<br />                        frustrating. When I'm taking on groups by myself, assuming 
<br />                        they're low class, it's not much of a problem. I just keep the 
<br />                        ship on a straight path and pick off the ships as the come in 
<br />                        range. Ship control would still be appreciated in these situations.
<br />
<br />6.  Path Finding
<br />     L When setting a waypoint for a target off the trade lanes, and the target is 
<br />          half way between lane points, your navigation computer sets way points 
<br />          in such a manner that you have to travel all the way down the lane, then
<br />          pick up the last waypoint by cruising to the target. You can obviously 
<br />          abort lane travel manually, which is what you'll end up doing to shorten 
<br />          trips to these mid-lane objectives. I just wish there was an auto lane 
<br />          break that your navigation computer could perform for you. It's a minor 
<br />          wish, thus I put it at the bottom (not that these were in any particular 
<br />          order).
<br />
<br />7.  Joining Factions
<br />     L Obviously Freelancer is the title of this game so being a Freelancer is 
<br />          obviously the point. In MP though, it would be nice if you could 
<br />          officially join a particular factions. Certainly this would have to be with-
<br />          in limits. Joining the Navy, Police or a coporation such as Synth Foods 
<br />          would certainly pose a huge restructure in the game itself. You'd have 
<br />          to perform missions on a regular basis, you'd have rank, and you'd be 
<br />          stationed somewhere and these things are enormous rewrites so I'm 
<br />          not talking about these situations. What I'd like to see is joining the 
<br />          Bounty Hunters, or Junkers, or Pirates in MP. You can certainly perform 
<br />          the actions of the above listed with out any official designation, but 
<br />          wouldn't it be cool if you could BECOME a bounty hunter and people 
<br />          (AI and real) would see you as one. Example: when AI hail you on the 
<br />          radio, you're referred to as &quot;Freelancer Alpha 1-1&quot; (the 1-1 changes 
<br />          depending on your login. If you're the 2nd person to login, you're 2-1 
<br />          for the session. Another nice detail.) but I'd like it to be &quot;Junker&quot; or 
<br />          &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; and the AI would react to you accordingly.
<br />
<br />          This is one of those things that might actually BE in the game,
<br />          but I've not experienced it yet.
<br />
<br />---------------
<br />
<br />Well that's about it. That's all I can think of. 
<br />
<br />Like I said, this is strictly a wish list. A WISH LIST! Everything I hoped this game would be, it is. Though it has been a long time in the 
<br />
<br />making, I think they've done a bang-up job. Even if this Beta IS the final product, I'd say that the fans are in for one hell of a treat. I know 
<br />
<br />there were plenty of people talking about how they've cut back on this or that feature, but truely, I don't think they'll care one bit once they 
<br />
<br />begin their adventure into a living universe.
<br />
<br />Thanks to Digital Anvil for a terrific game, thanks to Microsoft for backing it in whatever capacity, and thanks to all the fans that will soon 
<br />
<br />be enjoying it.
<br />
<br />I'll see you in my store!</div>

Defend against attacking targets. Option 2 allowed engaging multiple targets with as many turrets as you had. The automated options only worked when you were in the cockpit flying the ship. That would be a nice addition to use while you manuevered your Behemoth class freighter thru a field of roids until you could finish the turn to target and pop back into turret mode.</div>

			<div class="content">Actually by setting a waypoint, then selecting &quot;goto&quot; (F2) all ships will actually auto avoid asteroids and debri. It doesn't work quite as well if you're part of a formation (unless you're position 1). By doing that, and assuming you aren't in cruise mode (as your weapons will be inactive) you can fly safely while firing. But this only works on waypoints and if you're not in cruise mode.</div>
