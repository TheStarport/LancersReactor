			<div class="content">Wow.  And to think, 3 months ago, as I gazed dreamily at the statistics 1/30 and flew alone, I wondered will anyone ever show up on my server?  It seems I need to say something, anything . . . Freakzilla is right, I have giggled, even cackled once or twice as I read these.  The passion is fascinating, and understandable.  Some of you folks have been on Browclops for literally months, working on the same character or characters without interruption.  The player behind Bits has, through time and effort, proven himself to be dependable and trustworthy, and willing to put in the effort regarding the stability of the server.  He was a bit of a tight ass to begin with (I got nuthin' but love for ya Bits) but has loosened up considerably over time.  His 'server police' character is just that, financed originally by myself and later on his own.  He is the only person I have directly asked to monitor the server, if he is inclined, when I am not there.  Regulator is correct in my selecting him as another person to monitor the server in the same regard, but I have yet to talk directly with him and finalize this.  However, I am also in close communication with Argonus of the {AR} clan, and I have no doubt that their presence also helps to deter cheaters, modders and/or clans that are not interested in roleplay, but rather band together simply to control some aspect of the game.  I have always been purposely ambiguous in server rules, and this has served my purposes well for the most part.  I have welcomed anyone, clan or otherwise, to visit Browclops and stay, if it suits them.  I have also purposely stayed out of the clan agendas, meetings, etc., for I do not see that as a role I need to take on.  My job has always been to provide the most stable server I can, with a little extra something.  Thus were the events born, one at a time, through trial and error.  Some worked well, some didn't.  But the successes have been noted, and built upon by others.  It is true that I personally do not lead as many events as I used to, and the reasoning is two-fold.  1) I actually do work for a living, and employment is something I wish to retain for the time being <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and 2) others have taken up the mantle and are providing events on their own.  Now I'm losing my train of thought . . .
<br />I will not deny that I enjoy some upheaval, the quote of me was true and exact.  Months ago I created a character (since deleted) that claimed all of Kusari space for himself, and attacked anyone who entered.  It created quite a stir, this madman in a Dragon who died quite often.  There was some threat to others, but I died more often than not, and I think the excitement was well worth it.  It is within this framework that I see the clans forming now.  I certainly hope so, at least.  If  it turns out to be a negative factor, then adjustments will be made.  In any event, this game has held my attention far longer than I expected, and in a year no one will even remember this server existed.  The only demand I make of anyone on the server is to have fun, and keep it reasonable.

			<div class="content">:TO ALL CLANS:
<br />
<br />If you continue to claim clan space I will be forced to take drastic action.
<br />
<br />If your clan -
<br />1) claims space to be your own, and 
<br />2) members are flying very heavy fighters, 
<br />
<br />then when not in your 'clan space' I demand that you unmount 4 of the forward facing guns/missile points of your fighters. If I see any of your vhf's outside of your space with less than 4 unmounted gun/missile points I will take it as an act of aggression and shall dispose of your members until they have either unmounted four heavy guns, or returned to your space.
<br />In this event I shall give one single verbal warning to dock at the nearest station and unmount the weapons, or return to your space. If I catch the same person a second time, I will attack without warning.
<br />
<br />I call on any other non-clan players and clans which do not claim space to follow this guide.
<br />
<br />Obvious exceptions not listed for obvious reasons. But since the obvious is not quite obvious to some obvious people, server events would be an exception.</div>

			<div class="content">dammit twex - you made a liar out of me.  I will not dismount anything, nor will I advise any member of any clan (they can if they choose) to do so either.  If Clan VHFs have to disarm, ALL VHFs should have to.  Free travel throughout sirius was one of the first things all clans agreed to.  You are worried about.......NOTHING! HA!

			<div class="content">Nice post, Browclops. I feel that the action our clans are takin may be able to bring this server to a whole new level. We are taking the &quot;Base of Operations&quot; thing a bit farther and adding a serious roleplaying element, which will extend the life of this game, and hopefully, attract more players to the server.
<br />
<br />I have noticed some of the concerns about the clans claiming sectors as their own, and I am paying attention to all of them. I have no intention of turning the Rheinland sector into a dictatorship, or a place of chaos. I simply wish to make it more exciting for every person on the server.
<br />
<br />Think of it this way. We put a no piracy law in place, which will hopefully attact a lot of pirates wanting to cause havoc by breaking the law. The frieghter players and n00bs would have to petitiion to the clans for help. The frieghters and n00bs get a more exciting trade run, and the escorts get the bonus of a big fight, and some cash in return. 
<br />
<br />Everyone can enjoy this new clan territory, if they think outside the box of tolls and how unfair it is.</div>

			<div class="content">Fire, 
<br />I'm just indicating my direction, if you claim space to be your own, you can damn well defend that space with your vhf's, if your vhf's are leaving that space fully armed, then that is an aggressive move. If you have agreed to free-travel, then why do you need any more weapons? You can take any average npc out with any 2 heavy guns in about 10 to 20 seconds. If you want to escourt freighters outside of your clan space, then from my perspective you can do so in lf's or hf's not vhf's. If you think a 2 gunned vhf is an easy target for pk, yes it is, and if your vhf's are taken out then that will give your clan something to do rather than sit on their asses all night. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />  You may declare your personal war on the territorial clans if you may.  But, you request is unreasonable and will not be complied with.  We have the right to protect ourselves no matter where we are.  We may have enemies that wish to destroy us.
<br />
<br />  In addition, through the United Systems, we have Union Jurisdition in all systems.  No clan's claim to the Border Worlds will be recognized by the United Systems.  The Border Worlds will remain Federal Territory only.
<br />
<br />  This does not mean you cannot make a claim.  You can create an additional Clan group that doesn't recognize us as well.  For our role-playing purposes, we have set up the United Systems and recognize it as the sovereign entity.  The [GOV will not be the United Systems by itself as was originally planed.  A seperate entity has been created by the clan council that will be named United Systems unless changed by vote.
