			<div class="content">okay im board so im going to write a little (Ha) series and it's called pilot unoriganal or unimaginitive maybe but i'll save that for the series (chapter one might be a bit bad becuase its getting you into the world)
<br />oh i'll try to fix most of the spelling sorry
<br />oh for maybe the first 3 Chapters ill start by telling differnet peoples stories as sort of a lead up to the mian path of the storie
<br />
<br />Chapter one:
<br />
<br />The disturbances in the colonies had ended peace came and it seemed that things were going uphill. But the quiet peace was preperation for the staging of mass attack. A man named Deren Voe had just gotten out of sugerland prison for breaking and entering of goverment buildings within liberty space. After 20 years of hard brutal work  he finaly said goodbye to Liberty and hello to Rhienland. But before he entered he needed to seek out a expert hacker. So he left Liberty to the nearest lanehacker installment were he took some heavy money (he had hid from the police prior to his capture) and payed the best lanehacker to change his record. It basicly said that he was a x-employee of the Liberty goverment. The &quot;record&quot; said that he left to chase after the dream of justice and prospierity in Rhienland. After pulling some strings he had a job in the Rhienland goverment. Not high, his job was weapon affiars and technology. It was late in the evening and he decieded to get what he came to rhienland for there battleship blue prints. The Corsiars were prepared to offer 45 million credits for the blueprints. with his crimanal expertise he managed to copy a basic file he did this from his coworkers terminal to cover his tracks. He hid them in contanier that was placed inside another container filled with radation so it could not be scanned. But one problem arised 4 days ealier the Liberty goverment caught the hacker who did Deren's Record fixing. Rhienland knew everything he was at the tradelane and perpared to dock with it when 8 Rhienland heavy fighters decloaked the gave him a choice; jettision and surrender or die. He knew he couldn't fight all eight of them in a armored transport. One hand was on the eject cargo button the other on the thruster...

<br />
<br />&quot;yes sir be on the pad in 3&quot; Torren siad with a long sigh
<br />
<br />Torren walked on the pad and looked up at his ship for today the duo Liberty defender. he climbed up the ladder and watched as other pilots ran to there ships. he got in the copilots seat put on the flight gear and waited for Marshall.
<br />
<br />&quot;hey Torren lets get this bird of the ground&quot; Marshall said as he walked in.
<br />

<br />
<br />marshall flicked a few switches and flew out of the hangar
<br />
<br />&quot;okay men&quot; Rex said over the voice com &quot; were transporting gold si;ver and conficated contraband so were beging for a attack so make sure weapons are online  and lets go!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;roger&quot;  Torren said &quot;Hey Marsh you worried
<br />
<br />&quot;yeah probably first real combat mission and my dads watching so....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;well budie get ths sweet bird in formation with the others&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;gentlemen there a prob&quot; rex said over the com &quot; the utcasts have disabled the tradelane part that runs through the debris field we know there goung to hit there its 20 k of cruise speed do be alert&quot;
<br />
<br />The ships docked with the tradelane they just entered the derbis field when the trade lan cut
<br />
<br />&quot;here it is people&quot; rex said

<br />
<br />Verta Flyer (Torrens ship) doged behind a deris piece and came out charging dead at the outcast in a collsion course he shot and disabled the engine of the outcast. closer, closer, closer they flew until it seemed he would crash the he fired a volley of Missiles at the outcast breaking of his shield skimming the outcasts before the missiles hit at such a close range that the outcast shield couldn't do anything
<br />Torren flew up into the suns beams of light were he could only be detected with scanners becuase it was to bright to look into the sun and pounded some outcasts
<br />it was a small party of outcasts and the transports engines came on line
<br />
<br />&quot;Perry,Jones go with the transports do not i repeat do not enage hostiles&quot; rex called &quot;everone else follow me&quot;

<br />&quot;its not fair dammit, just not fair&quot; Torren Said
<br />
<br />&quot;What rex dying?&quot; Bones Replied
<br />
<br />&quot;Duh, of course he had a family kids. Me? I was a loner not evern a wife or a girlfriend my parents are dead! i should of gone&quot; Torren said sadly
<br />
<br />&quot;Look Tor, no one shuld of died but the outcasts&quot; Bones said &quot;if you died that base still would be there and we would of lost a damn good pilot&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Pilot eh, if im so good why am i here getting paid nothing while corsairs, outcasts and even some rouges get rich!&quot; Torren yelled
<br />
<br />&quot;No don't go there. Why we do what we do is becuase were the goods guys.&quot; Bones said to Torrens
<br />
<br />&quot;You don't sound so sure.&quot; Torren said as he walked off
<br />
<br />Torrens walked ino the bar. he stat down on a stool ordered a drinked and looked at the tv
<br />
<br />&quot;And now the news with randy mark libertys best Rhienland reporter!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hi im Randy Mark today in Rhienland a man with the blueprints to Rhienlands Latest flagship has managed to escape the law and is said to of headed towards the legendary home of the outcasts. Where ever that might be. Eight ships tried to stop him but failed as he  had already been entering acesses codes into the tradelane and the police there frogot to block the traded lane. aperantly he had skills of a hacker and closed three trade lane supports so it was about thirty k before police could use the lane. by that time he had disapeared with no sightings. Liberty has requested to help due to the fact that if pirates can build battleships the borderworlds and edge systems inside the houses could fall.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;well that just takes!&quot; Torren yelled drunk &quot; 5 elite fighters can't take out a small base and now the gunna have battleships!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;yeah&quot; another man yelled &quot;how the hell does a guy break in and get those codes i want some answers!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;well im gunna go to rhienland with the others and stop him&quot; Torren yelled
<br />
<br />Just then the bars doors were kicked down. and James Marshalls father stood in the doorway.
<br />
<br />&quot;are you drunk soilder&quot; he said pointing at Torren
<br />
<br />&quot;my Comanding oficer died, sir. i needed to relax&quot; Torren mumbled
<br />
<br />&quot;thats too bad soilder. a drunk is a drunk. i would arrest you but we need all the men we have so from now i on your patrolling texas!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;what no i was going to join the others in Rhienland&quot; Torren moaned
<br />
<br />&quot;not anymore soilder not anymore&quot; Admiral marshall said with a smile
<br />
<br />&quot;die you son of a..&quot; Torren said as he pulled out a gun and shout Admiral Marshall in the head
<br />
<br />Torren ran down the halls as men chased him. he ran even though the fired upon him. finaly he was in the hangar. he jumped in his ship fired up the engines. then Torren enterd the codes to open the hangar door.
<br />
<br />&quot;acess denied&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;ike hell it is&quot; Torren yelled as he launched three torpedos into the door and blasted into space
<br />
<br />END CHAPTER 3
<br />
<br />maybe a bit more today.....
<br />
<br />oh if anyone has any comments i would like to hear them. i dont mind if someone tells me my spelling if really bad becuase it probably is.

<br />Deren flew threw the borderworld hppy as a clam he would be rich on the outcast or corsairhome world slaves a nice house money, beer, wine whatever he wanted. it never crossd his mind that he might destroy humanity in siruis. it never crossed his min that millions would die becuase of him. that cities and entire systems might never be repaired. all that crossed his min was a nice house. he was flying along whn he heard a distress call.
<br />
<br />&quot;help to anyone out there i hit er.. something and engines are offline and lifesuports is faling due to a fire that is feeding on my oxegen supply i need he-&quot;
<br />
<br />Deren paused, he wasn't a man of mercy but he thought that the blueprints were safe and that this man might have a bit of money. for money is what Deren wanted. it was all about money even if he could never enter one of the houses agian.
<br />Derens ship came over and put itself down on the othermans ship. He made sure everything was inplace then he climbed down beetween ships. he needed to wear a oxegen mask due to the fact that there was little left. he grabbed the other man who lay knocked out on the floor.
<br />Then he Climbed back up to his ship. He shut that hatch and pulled out of there. soon the other man came to.
<br />
<br />&quot;were am i what happened?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; i got yer distress called pulled ya out of there. now lets talk bout my reward. Deren said with a big smile on his face
<br />

<br />&quot;what! i saved you for nothing! then out the airlock you go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
<br />&quot;oh&quot; Deren said &quot;so now i do get rewarded !&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;exactly&quot; the man said as pulled out a gun and shot deren in the leg. &quot;im a corsair. we knew you would sell the the outcasts and thats a big no no so now you die!&quot; The Corsair finished him off.

<br />
<br />chapter 5
<br />
<br />Torren huddle in the old depo scared cold and hungry. he knew he was dead it was over for him. the pain in his left leg grew. he wondered if themen he killed felt like this when they saw him coming. he difreted in and out of sleep. then the depo doors opened. and a man wearing blonde man wearing a brown jacket and a black shirt walked in.
<br />
<br />&quot;help me&quot; croaked Torren
<br />
<br />&quot;can you walk?&quot; the man said
<br />
<br />&quot;with some help, yes&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;okay lets go&quot;
<br />
<br />the man helped Torren to his ship. Torren looked at the ship, it was like nothing he had ever seen. sleek, dark black with a prototype engine. 
<br />
<br />&quot;fine ship you got&quot; Torren said
<br />
<br />&quot;yeah, well lets go&quot; 
<br />
<br />the ship flew up and was about to enage in cruise when five liberty defenders came at them. 
<br />
<br />&quot;unkown ship, the man you are carrying is a liberty priorty 3 crimanal surrender him now!&quot; a voice said of the com
<br />
<br />&quot;negavtive, he is under my porcetion now.&quot; the man repilied
<br />
<br />&quot;very well. all ships engage!&quot;
<br />
<br />The mans ship dogded the vollys of fire and swung around behing the lead and fired one missile at his engine. at first the engine expolded then the ship. the remianing defenders split into two groups and  attacked from either side of the man's ship. a classic liberty manuever but it seemed the man knew they were going to do that bursted beetween the 2 groups of ships and as the ships turned around he fired managing to blow up  1 of there ships and damage another. the damaged liberty ship just floated there and one of the other liberty ships fired on it and destroyed it. as the other ship shot 4 missiles dead on the ship Torren was on. the man tried to dodge but they were homned on soon they hit and rocked the hull. the man hit full cruise and blasted off going faster then anyother ships cruise could go.
<br />
<br />&quot;how did you do that?&quot; Torren asked
<br />
<br />&quot;easy this ship is a prototype order ship&quot; the man repiled
<br />
<br />&quot;why are you helping me?&quot; Torren said
<br />
<br />&quot;lets just say once all of liberty wanted me dead too&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;i never got your name&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;call me T&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;okay T&quot;
<br />

<br />
<br />The corsair pilot returned to the home world and gave the blueprints to the leader. the leader ordered that 35 of these ships be made. then he turned to the pilot.

			<div class="content">Chapter 7
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />5 am in the morning Bob welsh was stunt fling deep in the border worlds then a almost rhienland battle ship came on sensors. he tried to flee but it was to late the strange battle ship tractored his ship in range and the proceeded to destroy it
<br />
<br />_______________________________
<br />
<br />Torren landed on New Berlin as he walked into the landing area bar a man bumbed into him. and then walked off. Torren looked on the ground and there was a piece of paper there that read meet Bones in the Landing pad Ship Yard. 
<br />Torren walked over by the door. He looked in a window and saw no one so he thought what the heck went in. There Bones came out of the hadows
<br />
<br />&quot;Terron ive met with a Captian of a Battleship he and a few friendl who fly Cruiser's are willing to help us&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Help us do what Bones?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Fight the corsairs, they now control all of the borderworlds&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;what!&quot; excaimed Terron
<br />
<br />&quot;yeah look we going to meet the captian and 3 captians of cuisers in omega five&quot; Bones said
<br />
<br />Terron and Bones flew to the meeting point there was the battle ship and three cruisers and two fighter wings of eight fighters.
<br />
<br />&quot;welcome gentlemen i am Captian Verton of battleship Hiezburg. inel says that three of there battlships are in the follwoing area that i am uploading to your nureal net. now three battleships may sound like alot but there men have little to none training. and my crew fought in Kusari&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;hold on Captian&quot; one of the fighters said &quot;unkown fighter incoming has the same fighter design as Lt.Terron&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is T here, thought i would join you guys for a little combat&quot; T said
<br />
<br />&quot;hey T, your back.&quot; Terron Excaimed
<br />
<br />&quot;lets go people&quot; the captian yelled &quot;move now&quot;
<br />
<br />The fleet arrived at the area as three battleships came into view. 
<br />
<br />&quot;all escorst power up weapons and engage when ready&quot; The captian called
<br />
<br />&quot;fighter wing alpha engaging&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;fighter wing beta Engaging&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Now people&quot; T called
<br />
<br />The Rhianland battleship begand to shoot volleys at the incoming ships. T Weaved his way through thick battleship fire' a luanched a torpedo. Terron shout a missile into th hangar door as it opened to let fighters out.
<br />
<br />&quot;classic mistake&quot; The captian said &quot;good job Terron&quot;
<br />
<br />OIne of the battlships was Heavly damaged and the fighters wings closed in and fired a volley to finish it off. Meanwhile the other battleship had managed to get seven fighters out before it needed to close the hangar.
<br />Terron charged and there tight dimond formation weaving beetween the volleys fired until he was above the formation. then he dropped a anti station bomb he found left on his ship. the bomb hit one of the fighters wing and three of there fighters blew up as he flew away from the explosion.
<br />T came down hard on one of the remaing battleships shooting off the turrets but he was out of torpedos so there wasn't much he could do.
<br />Terron flew a charge on the other battleship firing his last two torpedos. just as he was about to pull up four fighters shot his ship
<br />
<br />&quot;shields failing hull burning im ejecting&quot; Terron called &quot;Pick me up T&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;roger Terron&quot; T replied
<br />
<br />Just as T was about to enter Tractor range one of the fighters grabbed him and flew to dock with one of the battlships. then the battlships hit cruise.
<br />
<br />&quot;well lets go&quot; Bones called
<br />
<br />&quot;we cant&quot; T repiled we need to reapair and in three minutes the'll meet five new battleships&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;how did they make so many&quot; The captian asked
<br />
<br />&quot;i dont know&quot; T replied &quot;But we have to stop them&quot;
<br />

<br />
<br />Terron awoke, he was tied to a chair and it was pitch black. Suddenly a light flashed on and a man he couldn't make out walked towards him.
<br />
<br />&quot;You come to my home system you kil friends and servers. Why? Whe have nver been recognized as more the common terrorists.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;the man hit Terron across the face. blood slowly rolleed down Terron lips.
<br />
<br />&quot;maybe if you stooped acting like common terrosists you wouldn't be called common terrosists.&quot; Terron mumbled
<br />
<br />&quot;what was that&quot; the man said &quot;youa re i no position to insult me. i can make this very painful for you. and were is You specail T Hahahaha&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;why are you luaghing about T&quot; Terron asked
<br />
<br />&quot;oh, you dont know your still pure and your still a man of liberty. your friend T works for the order. those not so common terrorists.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;what- no...no your lying&quot; Terron Mumbled &quot;He's a great man.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;if he's so great why didn't he tell you his name?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;why would i know&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;becuase He is Edision TRent former Head of state till he bribed the Priesedent. we know what it said in the news. it said high members of the goverment  strongly beleive that the priesident was bribed. what do you have to say now&quot; the man said
<br />

			<div class="content">Chapter nine
<br />
<br />&quot;why didn't you tell me&quot; Terron yelled &quot; why didn't you say you were a terroists who bribed the goverment'
<br />
<br />&quot;you believe a Corsair and the media&quot; T said &quot; i saved your life and this is what i get. yes i am Trent, happy. nut you know nothing! until a week ago you flew escort services for navy transports. and you think you have any idea on what the order is. goodbye Terron&quot;
<br />
<br />Terro stood there as Trent walked away. they had set up base on new berlin and had coninced the rhienland goverment to support them. out of the 34 battlships 21 remained. but the next day something aful had happend
<br />
<br />it was 2 am in the morning when the alarm went off
<br />
<br />&quot;all head personall report to mr.trents ready room&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;leaders of Rhienland, the order, freelancers, bountyhunters, liberty navy. the last 21 battle ships have entered the system today is the final battle beetween the law and the unlawful &quot; Trent said. &quot;all men to stations&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;all fighters launch repeat all fighters launch&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;come on Terron lets go to the hangar&quot; Bones called
<br />
<br />&quot;all fighters launch&quot;
<br />
<br />Terron flew his ship up as he met with a good 50 other ships and 16 battleships. he knew it would be the biggest battle ever in siruis history. the corsair ships arrived just out of range. both fleets flew towards eachother firing volleys upon volleys of lasers and and missiles.
<br />
<br />&quot;Torpedo ships into the gap attack&quot;
<br />
<br />Terron broke his attack on the fighters and did his classic weave as he chraged towards the battle ship he was with 70 m of the battleship when he luanched the torpedos and broke off.
<br />the battleship had taken severe damage but was not destroyed.
<br />
<br />&quot;engage fighters&quot; called Trent
<br />
<br />Terrons Squad broke off the attack on the battleship and moved agianst the corsairs forward wing.
<br />
<br />&quot;one of our battleships is down&quot; Trent yelled
<br />
<br />Terron locked on to a corsair ship and was just out of range. the corsair ship readied torpedos. closer, closer came Terron but not quite in range. just as he was in range the corsair launched the torpedo. Terron fired and took out the corsair and shot after the torpedo.
<br />he managed to knok the torpedo off course.
<br />Terron raised his hands and yelled &quot;yes!&quot; as he did that noticed a flashing light in his wrist he managed to make out the numbers that were flashing.
<br />he was wired with some sort of bomb. Terron broke of course and flew close the Corsair battleship. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Terron what are you doing&quot; Bones said
<br />
<br />&quot;when the Corsiars Catured me they let me go. but before that they must of wired me with a bomb waiting for this day so i would kill my squad and others on my side. so im doing the one logical thing. im ramming into the battleship!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;noooo&quot;
<br />
<br />Terrons ship hit one of the corsair battleships destroying it and another near it in a huge explosion.
<br />
<br />&quot;lets win this for him&quot; Trent called
<br />
<br />Bones engaged the other fighters and locked on to one and fired then another. then the backof his ship was hi he ahd lost control and spun of into space.
<br />there was one Corsair battleship left and 21 fighters and Trent had 6 battleships and 29 fighters. the corsiars retreated
<br />
<br />&quot;we won!!&quot; a pilot yelled
<br />
<br />&quot;for now&quot; Trent mumbled
<br />
<br />
