<br />The Teamspeak server has moved to a new server, so the IP for that has changed to 69.93.236.42 The password to log on the first time is portalive. You are welcome to use this Team Speak server to talk to your friends and talk to other players online while playing games such as Freelancer, Earth and Beyond and other games.
<br />For the Team Speak server use Anonymous the first time you log on then you can register with the server and make your own password. If you need the free Team Speak software you can download it from <a href='http://www.teamspeak.org/' Target=_Blank> here </a>.

For those of you wishing to use the Ventrilo voice chat service, download the client from <a href='http://www.ventrilo.com/download.php' Target=_Blank> here </a>, and connect to portalive.com with a password of portalive.

<br />
<br />Don't forget that the IRC server is always up and running, and you can join with the java client if you don't have irc software. The Lancers Reactor Freelancer chat channel can also be found <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/chat/' Target=_Blank> here </a> on Lancers Reactor.

<br />For those of you that don't know what The Freelancer Mod Manager is, it lets you instantly and easily activate and deactivate mods whenever you want. It backs up files before modifying them, and does three levels of error detection before activating a mod. It also lets you download and install mods with one click from a web page, by use of a custom file format (modName.zip.flmod).
<br />It even works with mods not made to work with it; just unzip the mod into the appropriate directory! (read the Help/How Do I... documentation for more info)
<br />For Questions, Requests and Feedback about the Freelancer Mod Manager please see The Lancers Reactor &gt; Forums &gt; Freelancer MOD: Freelancer Mod Manager &gt; <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=30210&amp;forum_id=32&amp;Topic_Title=%2A%2AUTILITY%2A%2A+Freelancer+Mod+Manager+v1%2E31&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Mod+Manager&amp;cat_title=Freelancer+MOD&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank> **UTILITY** Freelancer Mod Manager v1.31 </a>

<br />Wasabe has created a couple of mods for server admins. One of them adds the requested Battleship missions, and the other adds harder missions to Manhattan and/or more missions available at Manhattan. These are both server side only mods, so clients don't need to download anything. Even the infocards on the battleship missions work perfectly. Both mods are simple XML scripts. Both have been tested extensively on a server and they work perfectly.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=964' Target=_Blank> <b>The Mars Flyer made by Harrier, Glock36 and Crabtree </b> </a>
<br />This is the best ship I have ever seen. Three of the best Modders out there worked on it for our gaming pleasure. The original model was made by Derrin Proctors for the movie War of the Worlds. Harrier got permission to use it and made the textures and then Glock36 performed his magic on it and did the weapons, lighting and custom sounds. After all that was done, Crabtree did the scripting and tweaked the flight characteristics. The result of all that hard labor is just an amazing ship. Everything about this ship is custom made; the textures, weapons, sounds, maneuverability and lighting. You can use it in Singleplayer and Multiplayer games. You can buy the ship at Planet Manhattan at the beginning of the game with money left over for nanobots and shield batteries, although you probably won't need them. The Mars Flyer comes fully equipped and ready to blow your opponents to space dust. Have a blast, from all of us.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=933' Target=_Blank> <b>Alternative SP Ships by Rsdnt-Evle </b> </a>
<br />This is his first Mod and it adds two fighters that are in the game, but not for sale: the Starblazer and the Blood Dragon fighter.
<br />He made the Starblazer as an alternative to the Crusader and it's for sale on Planet Leeds in the Leeds System. He made it a heavy fighter for the sake of using the HF shields, as it's supposed to be an alternative to the Crusader. It only has 4 guns, but enough power to shoot them twice as long before draining. It's powerful enough to be useful, but still leaves a challenge.
<br />He made the Blood Dragon as an alternative to the Hawk and it's for sale on Kyoto Base in the Chugoku System. It's slightly more powerful than the standard Dragon HF and its about on par with the Anubis. You can use it to finish the SP campaign if you'd like to have an alternative. Info cards are included for both ships.

Specs are on the download page.
<br />Buyable on the Battleship Osiris and Planet Toledo.

<br />Chris is back! It has been a long time. He missed modding and playing Freelancer since he made the Trent Clothes Collection Mod (1, 2 &amp; 3), The Music Replacement Mod, the Monkeys and the Order Mod (with the Music Addon Mod), The Engine Trail Mod and the annoying FNN News Channel Mod so he made another Mod called the Realistic Sound Mod.
<br />This Mod will change the landing and the launching engine sounds of Freelancer.

<br />This is a POC (proof of concept) Mod for a &quot;mooring base.&quot; This mod adds a simple base to the mooring fixture above Planet Manhattan that sells commodities, has repairs, nanobots, shield batteries and ammo available for purchase but not much more. Other than the side-effect of allowing fighters, freighters and capital ships to dock with the mooring fixture, it's intended to create an example for more realistic capital class docking with a planet.
<br />This Mod is a P.O.C. (proof of concept), and is left open source. You may modify it, adapt it, change it and/or redistribute it as long as it contains the original file and Metrals name as the programmer/creator of this concept/mod.

<br />This is a proof of concept project that replaces the docking rings in New York with invisible planetary beacons.
<br />There are two Modes
<br />Mode 1: Single Dock with planetary link - This mode allows you to select a planet as usual and use the dock command and it will work, also like usual only 1 ship can dock at a time.
<br />Mode 2: Multi-Dock without planetary link - This mode allows up to 6 ships to dock at the same time, however you are not able to select the planet and dock you must select the beacon/dockring to dock to the base.
<br />The code is commented so you know how to use either type in your own project. Keep in mind that this is only a proof of concept and that it is not of any professional quality and not recommended for use.

<br />
<br />Maybe not for some people it wouldn't be so I asked the Script Guru - Chips to make a starting credit options Mod. The options are made possible now because IGx89 made this possible with the Freelancer Mod Manager.
<br />This is for Singleplayer games only, not Multiplayer incase you were wondering. There are two sets of options - first is if they are playing the storyline - you will get that money when you accept the ship from Juni.&lt;br&gt;
<br />If you want to play Open Singleplayer you need <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=141' Target=_Blank> Xerx's Open SP </a> activated for the Open Singleplayer part of the options.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=842' Target=_Blank>  <b>Vampire X2000 made by Necrolord </b> </a>
<br />This is an update for the Vampire with better design and a new skin. The Vampire is now black and red with red flames coming from the engines and a see through glass hull with a pilot inside. There are now 4 guns and 2 turrets instead of 6/1. Also the ship is already fitted with 2 class 8 Vampire guns, 2 class 8 Vampire turrets, 2 class 10 Paralyzer missile launchers and a class 10 shield. The Mod is now scripted so it no longer replaces ini/dll files. What does that mean? It should run with most other mods.</div>

<br />The FB14 Vampire X2000 is a ship similar to planes flown in WW2. However, it isn't based on any original plane, but instead modeled after the FB14 Vampire from the Crimson Skies game. This is Necrolords first Mod and he will be adding more ships to the Mod as he makes them.

<br />After the sales from the Antaeus in the Sirius sector, Konfliction Industries then went into the research and development of a freighter that would be the future force for hauling the construction materials for future projects. The Camara is the result of that effort. The Konfliction Mod v1.0 has two ships The Camara a new freighter and The Antaeus.

<br />The Silver_Fire Weapon Mod Pack adds 49 new weapons to the game including Cluster Missiles, Cruise Missiles, EMP Mines, Sniper Interdictor Missiles, Point Defense Weapons, Rocket Pods, Mass Drivers, and Shockwave Missiles. The weapons are sold on Manhattan, New London, New Tokyo, New Berlin, Malta, and Crete. For the Weapons that need it, Ammo is now sold everywhere.
<br />You MUST have FLMM v1.2.1 beta 5 or higher for this mod to work.

<br />Version 1.3 of the Game Play Patch Mod makes the game a little harder since the NPC's are now better equipped (in scenario missions too). They now carry Screamers, EMP Missiles, better Mines, Weapons and Shields!! Platforms and Stations are more resistant and collision damage has been increased. Ammo for new weapons is now available everywhere and main Planets and Bases sell all Equipment. The Cruise Speed has been reduced to 500 to avoid problems in the story line. The first mission now pays 20,000 credits and there are more ships for sale in bases that sell ships.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=822' Target=_Blank> <b>Black Label Mod for Freelancer made by Acid </b> </a>
<br />This mod is designed to be a collection of only the very best of ships and equipment built for Freelancer. The aim is to introduce some fine equipment to the Freelancer universe without it either being a 'total conversion' or a 'bolt-on mod'. Two things will always be true in this mod. First is that there will only be a small amount of high quality mods collected together within it, and the second is that the mods will be integrated as tightly as possible with the game.
<br />At this time, there are only two additional ships and one piece of equipment that have been added to the game. These are all detailed below:
<br />Starviper
<br />The starviper is the first ship to come out of the APS shipyards, and I still think it's the best from that stable. It is a high quality model which is well appointed and the fact that it bears a faint resemblance to the Civilian ships helps it integrate with the Freelancer universe. The starviper is available for purchase on the Battleship Hood and Planet Junyo, but it is also the mainstay of the Farmers' Alliance. Expect to come up against some of these ships if you travel much through Kusari space.
<br />Slipstream
<br />The Slipstream is an offering by FireBase which acts as a showcase for good ship design in Freelancer. It is a well appointed high quality model with a clean look which is not inconsistent with the general design of Freelancer ships. It can be purchased from the Battleship Hood and Bruschal Base. As the latter may suggest, the ship is flown by the Bundschuh so expect to see it around Rheinland space, not necessarily on friendly terms.
<br />Chain Gun
<br />Harrier has created an outstanding weapon that comes as a primary weapon and a turret mount. This is a rapid fire energy weapon which fires hundreds of rounds per second. One small point of note, this weapon is classified as a class 6 weapon due to the energy draw and damage potential of a single shot. That having been said, you will probably want to mount this on a ship that can handle extreme weapons and have the power supply to feed them because of the refire rate. Even ships with an optimal rating of class 6 will probably feel the strain of extended use of these weapons. They can be purchased at the same locations as the new ships, along with some additional shields which are not generally for sale anywhere else.

New in this release are fully updated systems with some background elements restored for even better visuals. A new economy system system has been added which will make things more interesting for those that prefer trading to other occupations. The Anubis is once again affordable in the singleplayer campaign but you better save up some credits because it is not cheap.

<br />selectable AI difficulty when activating the mod. I look forward to hearing your feedback.

<br />Free Worlds is a total conversion (TC) mod for Freelancer. Free Worlds will completely change all aspects of the Freelancer universe to resemble that of a certain &quot;galaxy far, far away&quot;. There is faction play, NPC vs Player balancing, weapons systems, loot, commodities, infocards, on and on and on... Two new ships have been added to this new version, the A-Wing and the E-Wing. A new system, Bilbringi, is also ready to be explored. This is still a MultiPlayer only mod.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=726' Target=_Blank> <b>Freelancer Rebalance Mod v3.20 made by Michael Dan </b> </a>
<br />-The AI controlled NPC ships will effectively use their nanos and shield batteries to repair their ships and recharge shields!
<br />-At default and hard level, the easy and medium npc pilots will repair their hulls while the hard and ace ones(above level 12) will repair both the hull and recharge the shield using nanobots and shield batteries.
<br />-At hard level the repair rate will be much faster and the baddies will have more nanos and shield batteries!
<br />-Added the LI Heavy Ion Blaster, a Liberty design combining the advantages of a laser cannon and a plasma blaster. I have improved graphics+sounds to make it look and feel like a Liberty super gun.
<br />-The BD &quot;Dragon's Breath&quot; Laser cannon now has much improved visual quality making it look more like a pirate super-laser gun.
<br />-Added Silver Fire's weapon Pack 1.1 including the new mass drivers and rocket pods. Modified cluster missiles to have less tracking abilities, but to be able to fit into weapon, turret and torpedo slots. making them some of the most versatile weapons ever available.
<br />-Shield capacitors offer increased protection against pulse, missile an capital ship type weapons, also slightly increased vs Tachyons and Neutron class. They're almost impervious to mass driver weapons.
<br />-All battleship and cruiser/destroyer turrets have reduced effects vs shields. This increases the realism since these turrets were made for capital vs capital battles. Only BS and CA flak and missile turrets do full shield damage.
<br />-Added tradelanes all throughout the EFA system linking planets and jumpholes. Also added a new base near Planet Jupiter, the Jupiter Observation Station.
<br />-Added Porsche's Jedi T-Fighter available at Shinagawa Station in New Tokyo.
<br />-Added the Antaeus made by Konfliction industries, buyable at BS York and Tsushima Station.
<br />-Weapon type for the Barragers, Sunfurys and the Kusari Hyper Pulse is now capital class so they do reduced shield damage.
<br />-The TIE turrets now have 360 degree rotation angle, making them useful on freighters as well.
<br />-The cruise speed comes at a price now: not only it will render weapons unusable but it will drain the main reactor's power at high rates. you may have to pause the cruise to allow the power to recharge.
<br />-Engines also drain power in normal mode from the fusion reactor, even if at lower rates. if you go at top speed you'll notice a slight decrease in power regen, so reduce your speed to achieve better regeneration rates.
<br />-All engines have infocards showing the theoretical max speeds, the energy draw and the cruise energy draw.
<br />-Mounting fusion reactors upgrades will increase cruise time and weapon regen rate at max speed.
<br />-Added commodity vendors to plot spawned bases such as Baxter Research Station and Glorious Station.
<br />-Ship vendors are working correctly now on Holman Outpost.
<br />-Beware of the powerful explosions of battleship in Random Missions, these really hurt now! Nomad Battleships hurt the most.
<br />-Random mission have further variation as cruiser/destroyer class ships can be both defensive and capital class stations.
<br />-Ships have been moved around again so expect surprises. Run the Data Storm on the modded FL folder to avoid these if you prefer to know exactly where the ships are.
<br />-The mod is compatible with the 1.1 patch except some TIE ships and the SkyHawk. players buying the Skyhawk or the TIE ships(the TIE Bomber and Tie Advanced) will be kicked as cheaters. The other 3 TIE ships(Fighter, Defender and Interceptor) are working normally.
<br />-Fixed the hardpoints for the Javelin Assault Cruiser, added more so now it has 32 gun/turret HP''s, 8 main guns and 24 secondary support turrets.
<br />-Added the Leviathan Warship Class &quot;Balistner&quot; from the Fightspace mod available in the EFA system. It's the ultimate Capship in terms of firepower and protection.
<br />-Fixed several bugs regarding the EFA system commodities, ship vendors on several stations and powerplant infocards mixed with engine infocards.

<br />You start in one of three locations:
<br />First: You start on Freeport7 with the ton of Boron. You can sell it to Lonigan and go about your way however you feel.
<br />Second: You start outside Freeport 7. You have not received payment from Lonigan, so you may collect the cargo for a small fee from the station merchant, and your transport from the ship dealer again. Without that million credits, you best go find somewhere to sell it.
<br />Third: You start in the border worlds. You have just brought your load of Boron on the cheap, and now must head to the Freeport 7 system to meet with Lonigan and sell your cargo. It is worth 1 million credits remember!
<br />Additional:
<br />While in Freeport 7 you can pick up some handy hints from Lonigan and even some police about what to trade well.
<br />If you follow those suggestions you will soon be making lots of money.
<br />You can undertake missions in Freeport 7 - but watch out, there are some nomads about!

The F-22 is more like the 78 Hammerhead; agile, with fast firing cannon and perfect thruster to quickly enter or leave the battle. The Su-35 is closer to a Titan with its amazing armor and size. The Su-35 carries a total of 14 weapons including one cannon and missile turrets, so the craft can fire 3 missiles against foes behind and alongside together with mines. Both ships have their own authentically based weapons, ammo is available at the Battleship Westfalen, where you can also buy these ships, and the ammo is also available in the Edge Worlds metropoles.

Freeport 7 has been rebuilt and you can dock there. You can also buy equipment on the base. You can also go to the other systems normally closed in Freelancer. Populate those systems, a choice between light, normal or extreme nomads. In Toledo there were 18 nomad fighters hunting me down! 
<br />This mod doesn't clash with Chips Open SP version, although it say it does. This mod doesn't clash at all with the Open SP mod. You can go to the other systems using the nomad jumpgates. These jumpgates might not have any names due to FLMM not generating the names for the systems.

It combines new graphics and new sounds, to create an overall moodier Freelancer. Bigger explosions, darker systems, improved sounds, all combined together to improve the overall Freelancer gaming experience, and add a touch or realism to the game. One of the advantages of this mod is that it only changes things processed on the client's side that do not affect mutliplay, so it can be used in multiplayer, without causing any lag! GSM has been designed from the ground up to do this, and has been extensively tested (there were well over twenty public betas before this final release).

<br /><b>The story </b>
<br />Shortly after their relocation to the harsh desert world of Kharak, the Exiles forgot both their origins and technology. It took them 3,000 years to struggle back to the stars. Having rediscovered hyperspace and the location of their original planet, all the families of Kharak, or kiithid, united to build a mothership that could take them home. Just as they prepared to embark, however, the brutal Taiidani Empire took notice and attacked. Enforcing an ancient decree forbidding the Exiles from developing hyperspace technology, the emperor had his forces immolate the planet. Only those already in space survived.

The battlestation missions have especially been made deadly so that groups are now more or less required to do them in order to survive. It IS possible to solo one, if you have about 30-45 min to spare for 1 mission and are very careful. Those that think Battleships will save them will find themselves in a middle of a meat grinder.
