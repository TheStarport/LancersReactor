<br />Add trains and Armored transports
<br />Add dock rings to kusari space

<br />
<br />Hmm not a bad idea.  One slight problem though with what you said.
<br />
<br />Make 1 green, 1 red and the rest nuetral right?
<br />
<br />You said &quot;Make the &quot;bribe&quot; cost nothing and only appear on said factions bases and be offered by that factions reps only and <b>only if you have a good standing with them to start with   </b>.&quot;
<br />
<br />How can you change your rep with any of the nuetrals then if you have to have a good one to start with?
<br />
<br />Now however what IS feasible....how about this.
<br />
<br />You can &quot;choose&quot; 4 paths like on the game box. Lets use the following: 
<br />
<br />Military --- (good to all military, red to all pirates, nuetral to rest)
<br />Merchant --- (good to all non-military / police, red to pirates, nuetral to rest)
<br />Bounty Hunter --- (good with BH, &amp; police, red to pirates, neutral to rest)
<br />Pirate --- (good to all pirates, red to police, BH, military, nuetral to rest)
<br />
<br />Would something like that work?  it is very feasilbe, it would just take me some time to implement <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />You could techinally have what you suggested above, but you would need to be able to do it at nuetral status.  I will think on this and see what I can do for my mod <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<h3><a href="#p132158" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Thats not quite what I meant sorry for the inprecise language.  I don't want to exclude ever being able to gain good standing with some faction, but as it is you can't have proper faction versus faction wars with players involved its far too easy to alter your standing with any faction.  This way it is more official and permanent.
<br />
<br />Ex:  You choose to fight for the Corsairs and make every one that doesnt like criminals and the Corsairs mortal enemies (red hessians) most of all not like you ever again well atleast not without turning around and fighting the Corsairs back to prove you are changing sides.  Also you make the Corsairs friends like you more.  If you look at the way FL's factions operate there is always a neutral faction that you can do missions for that will alter everything back I just propose on top of that to make it not so easy.  This is a sim of a small universe is it really that easy for people to forget your transgressions?
<br />
<br />Okay on teh [CWUniverse server we have several teams namely traders and pirates well its way too easy for one of the traders to make friends with our [pirates allies the Hessians which is where our bases are, they [traders just show up and hunt us down without the AI twitching a single turret in their direction.
<br />
<br />I mean what I am proposing is not that much of a change to how it behaves, well in theory that is what I am proposing.  In practice you have to alter the availability variables otherwise you could go anywhere (more or less) and choose the be in any group and do it for free.  Then up the faction shifting variables so that the enemies of your new home become completely &quot;Your&quot; enemies too and the factions allies become your bestest friends as well.  Ok so now the player has fewer options they can switch to one of their current faction's allies (because they are already green with them) or find a neutral faction that are allies with a hostile faction they wish to join then make it so it takes several missions to get in the green (to prevent turncoats from exploiting the faction chooser mod) with the neutral guys now u can enter the previous hostile factions space do some missions for them get in the green finally and then after some of that you can sign on with a previously hostile faction.  Of course I would rather it force the player to make a whole new character--would you trust a former Corsair if you were a Red Hessian?
<br />
<br />Figures though that it probably can only really affect the three in the dialogue negatively and the rest have simple modifers of alliegance, etc.  Still I never said put this in your mod I was just asking where to look to change this since you are the only one I have seen that opened a tutorial thread about it.  But do say where you got the idea from <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> if you do add this.
<br />
<br />Just point me to it, I'll work on it and you can add it to your mod when I'm done <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br />Okay wait brainstorm ok you have a simplier idea if you do that much at some point then I can go back and make the allegiance change more precise or like I said just point me to which dll its in I'll figure the rest.
<br />
<br />man I repeated myself 3 or 4 times I just really fear someone is going to misinterpret my idea and just call it lame.

			<div class="content">But Reynen Pirates are inherently not allies with each other at all and the Corsairs are practically their own house.  Players should indentify with one group not a large clump of people.  But hey take my idea and make it simplier.  I and others want some serious turf wars I'm just asking how to do it.
<br />
<br />I see that your mod makes PvP very simple to get started but I like FL with all its diverseness no matter how fake the numbers themselves might be or how bad the balance might be.  I think that we can really make a Role Playing game out of it still with Player versus Player and have Faction Wars all in one.  That is what I am aiming for.  You've got what 48 star systems and almost that many factions and you're limiting the player to just 4 different ones, you do realise that you'll need to alter the info for all the star systems/factions or it'll sound silly.  When you're done it won't be FreeLancer anymore.
<br />
<br />I can see I'll be altering lots of values but I don't mind the work if it has that end.  Of course based on your earlier posts and the way your mod is progressing I am assuming that eventually you'll be adding the diversness that FL had back into it or atleast make a light version of your mod.  Just an example you have the Bretonian Gunship but not either of the Bretonian Fighters.  So the mod I was thinking of that would let you choose a faction you can't really do if you choose to play as a Bretonian Military or Police as with your mod as it is you can't use either of their fighters.  While I agree the ship models themselves amongst each faction dont look very different from each other ie Dagger, Sabre and Stilleto.  You could keep one of each fighter style/look, the Cavalier perhaps?  I assume the ships you chose for your mod you based it on their style and the easiness of adding extra HPs.  I don't know, you have done lots of balancing work with the ones you chose which is excellent.  I guess if anymore of the original craft were readded with your modifications it couldn't fit into your balance or would feel or handle like the ship next to it.  So say you did put the Cavalier back in it would look different but because of your balance system it would handle/feel like the Dagger.
<br />
<br />PvP needs the boost that this mod gives it, but at the cost of player diversity and immersion.  I can fly for the Police but I can't really feel like I am flying for the Police if I am in a Dagger and can't fly a Police ship.
<br />
<br />Yup once again I answered my own questions and worries.  Nevermind.
<br />
<br />These were all just propositions and flagrant ideas.  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  I can see that you are working your own ideas into FL from the bottom up, which I like, gives the end user the chance to see each stage of progress.  I just want to know how far up are you going to go.

			<div class="content">Hmm very good points on the faction, I am not quite sure what to do on them yet on them.
<br />
<br />As far as the left out ships, believe me I have &quot;special&quot; plans for all the rest of the ships, it is just going to take time to implement.  I don't want to spoil all the surpises otherwise the mod will get boring and I don't want that <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Cmd_hall, BOTH the person who runs the server and the person who plays on the server need to have the same version for this to work.  It sounds like you ran a server with my mod, but the people connecting didn't have it.  Direct them here to download it.
<br />
<br />I will be releasing BETA 4 by tommorow night, I found some bugs with the gunboats and balancing issues, like Gunboats doing more damage then the Cruisers hehe.  I've been updating the readmefile as I go, it has been updated 5 times tonight.  Almost 1am now, rdy to call in the night.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Ok it's now past 2 am.  The readme has been updated with all the stuff going in BETA 4 including stats on the BS, CR, and GB turrets.  Enjoy.  I'm off to bed.

			<div class="content">I must admit Kierok i really like your idea, ive longered to work for the liberty police / bretonian armed forces etc. This could fit very well n with the game, and it would broaden the mission spectrum, eg you could be told to do a patrol for the military (as they are in game), you could be ordered to transport viatal supplies or escort a convoy. Told to destroy a rouge base with wingmen who start with you at the start of the mission. I also believe what would make it seem as if you are part of said faction, is to get rid of that damn Freelancer Alpha 1-1 thing to which ever faction you belong to eg if you are v v freindly with Borderworld Exports your call sign could be Bowex black 12 and you callsign could change depending on the missions you take on. This probably doesnt make any sense and probably cant be implimented, but thats what i felt would make this game feel right <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Thanks, Rey, it's VERY helpful (now what was that ids again?...)
<br />
<br />I DID IT!  I MADE A STATION IN ALASKA!  IT WORKS!  W00T! <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Now I gotta add merchants and stuff.  The hard part is gonna be making encounters and patrols and such, cause it's all zones.  Since there aren't any zones, ya can't get missions.
<br />
<br />UPDATE:
<br />I've got the station stocked with equipment, comodities, and ships, but I can't get encounter zones working.  Need help with that.  Also, the docking ring is rotated the wrong way, but how do ya rotate stuff?  I can't figure it out.  Also, I can't find where it references the info about it.  In the file it does reference, it just lists the technical info, like class, amenities, population, etc.  but it is adding the reference of trenton outpost, the original I copied.
<br />
<br />Rey, do ya think making a high damage energy weapon and having in use ammo would be cool?  I can do it if ya want me to.
