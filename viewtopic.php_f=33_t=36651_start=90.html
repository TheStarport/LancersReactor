			<div class="content">Hey guys, news here.
<br />I have completed the new Vega Minor system (new Interespace hub of activity in the Edge Worlds).
<br />I have also received ArchKaine's <i>Wrath </i> -- and WOO is it an <b>awesome     </b> ship!! Yay-yuh <img src=smilies/icon_smile_cool.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> It is simply the best VHF out there - holy cow, with its custom equipment and weaps, it's just unstoppable. Check it out: <a href='http://www.photo.net/photodb/' Target=_Blank> Aten pics </a>
<br /><i>((And please note here:that link is to my Photo.net account. I couldn't get it to let me just view the pics - only let me look from inside my workspace. That MEANS that I am trusting y'all guys, you vandals <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>, not to delete or mess with them please. Just so ya know. Didn't think it was an issue, just making sure. I wouldn't mess up someone else's stuff, so please try to return the favor. Thanks ))  </i>
<br />
<br />Anyway, sorry to gush - ArchKaine is now the proud creator of the deadliest VHF in Sirius <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Moving on, I am not quite done with the level/class capping yet - need a little more time for that.  I think ... I think that that is the only thing left to finish.  Let's see, got all the bugs worked out that I know of, made sure encounters worked all over, made sure new ships and NPC ships worked, checked new zones/systems, ... I think that this is the last thing I need to do before the mod is ready <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I think we are looking at a estimated release of next weekend.
<br />How does that sound? Bien?
<br />Gotta hit the books for now - been modding for the past 36 hours, so need to start that <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I have a very cool idea for Rebalance 3.6, but I need to talk with MD first. Let ya know more about that when I have the authoriztaion .. *scoff* just kidding. Nah, just some cool new ideas from a creative and thoughtful fellow Freelancer. Again, just strong <i>desire  </i> right now, not actual work yet, but we'll see <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Later, comrades.

			<div class="content">Heya people,
<br />
<br />Ok, a couple things...
<br />
<br />Ro9ue, if you want to, you can upload those pics to flspace, at least people will be able to look at them. Photo.net wants people to create an account, and I at least am unable to look at the pics, it's always been that way as far as I can remember. So if you want to upload all your pics from there to flspace, go ahead and do so. Just try to keep them fairly small. Since I'm not sure how much space I have available (shared account with a friend).
<br />
<br />Warrior:
<br />I haven't looked into a file splitter for Rebalance, but that's a possible idea. Additionally, I've been looking into ways to get the end result as small as possible. So far the best compressor that I've been able to find is based on Bzip2, which is primarily a Linux/Unix compressor, but there are utilities out there for Windows that support it, as I think WinRar does. Once I'm able to get the final release of Rebal 3.5 from Ro9ue, I'll play around with it and let you all know what results I got. One alternative that I've also tried is creating a self-extracting executable that would directly import the Mod into your Mod folder. but there was no real advantage to doing that, other than just another one-click extraction type thing, which FLMM handles admirably on its own.
<br />
<br />Let's see, what else?
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, Shawn_Barry<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Best I can say, since I don't know for certain, as is the case for everyone. Asap.
<br />
<br />By the way guys, I've been attempting to setup the flspace site to handle the Rebalance 3.5 info/news, and I was wondering what you guys would think of possibly setting that up as the primary place to go for info and discussion about Rebal?
<br />
<br />I've had a few false starts, but the site itself is ready to go. Also, members can create their own threads in the forums, and there's limited file upload capability. Nothing too huge, I think I have the limit set to 5 meg per file. I know it's an extra hop on the internet for some of you. But I think it might still work out for everyone. Also it would allow all the guys(or girls) who are working on Rebal a place to collaborate on new ideas, possibly for 3.6 <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Also, if it becomes necessary, I might be able to hand a couple of people Moderator, or some sort of Admin status. But that's something I have to be careful about, since it is a shared account.
<br />
<br />Anyhoo, let me know what you all think, I'd be very interested <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, something that I forgot to mention. Can I get all those who are actively helping with the Mod to sign up on flspace? For reasons mentioned above. Also, I think it'd be cool to have a place for the team to meet up and collaborate on the mod. The address is: <a href='http://flspace.genocide-inc.com' Target=_Blank>http://flspace.genocide-inc.com</a>.
<br />
<br />Virushunter:
<br />Let me know how the perl code works out. If it's good, I'll suggest you upload it to flspace (and here for that matter). Any tool that helps with editing is a very good thing <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Bah, I know I'm forgetting something, so I'll probably end up editing this again <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Later Gators <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Hey hey, ArchKaine,
<br />I for one am interested in making flspce the new Rebalnce &quot;home&quot; page. So if all can agree, we can link the &quot;FL Rebalance Mod&quot; forum right to the site so that we are all in our own site. How about it? I would just start posting in there, but I don't want to if no one else is <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Can't really have a discussion like that, now can you?
<br />I'll upload the pics sometime soon (gotta do dang homework at the moment), as well as the prog <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Hmm, ok, update here: Vega Minor is complete: asteroid fields, planets, moons, population, lootable fields, missions, new ships, new weapons, and an &quot;advanced&quot; sun corona (gradually damages you more the closer you get to the sun .. nifty and realistic). Encounters with Outcasts, IC, Coalition, and IMG ... pretty fun and challenging at the same time.
<br />
<br />I have ideas for serveral new systems and ships for 3.6, but again, gotta check up with the boss 'bout it before I hit the gas <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I think we can remove some unused ships, systems, and bases to make room for the new ones, ones that will be more &quot;FL-like&quot; than some of the current ones. So hang on to your seats for a little longer <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Looking like a Sunday or Monday release for next weekend, though there is the possiblilty that it'll be the one after that. But hey, it is soon.
<br />
<br />I'll check back in later, compadres. Peace.

<br />*clears throat*
<br />
<br />Shawn ... my dear brother ... I do not mean to be rude or offensive, but do you read posts in this forum? If you don't, it could help you out if you started to.
<br />
<br />I posted at the beginning of January that it would an early February release. I was afraid that something would pop up and maybe postpone that estimate. 
<br />Now, for the past week and a half, we have been discussing release. Due to several unexpected things that have popped up, I announced last weekend that it would be this weekend before it was ready. 
<br />But again, I have been modding like crazy (to the point that I have fallen behind in school - make that <b>sleep,  </b> which is very important when doing schoolwork (as much as I hate to admit that - stupid sleep <img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) Since i could not think straight last night after school, I had to just sleep for 10 hours before i could start homework, which I had in every. single. class <img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> So I am at home right now doing all my friggin homework, and i plan to mod tonight after I am done with it.
<br />All that remains to be done is this : finish editing all the custom ships to limit the weapon/equipment levels for all ships (to balance thigns). I also need to limit the Hyper ships, so that they do not go faster than aroud 1200 m/s max (no unlimited acceleration like in 3.4, but also not as limited as 3.5 beta3).
<br />
<br /><b>THEN, </b> Rebalance v3.5.0 will be ready.
<br /> <b><i>And please READ the forum before posting!! </i>Beleive it or not, reading is a useful skill <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> </b> So put it to use, bro.
<br />Later, comrades.

			<div class="content">Heya people,
<br />
<br />Hmm, let's see, who was it that asked about Admin Ships? I seem to remember that black_sabbath did... Anyhoo, I'll go on that assumption, correct me if I'm wrong <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />black_sabbath:
<br />Interesting idea, I'm not sure how to implement that, but It's not too difficult to create custom made ships for various factions. I guess it could be a ship that you're assigned via freelancer character editor, after you've purchased a similar ship (for example, you go and buy the &quot;Shadow Wrath&quot;, then your account is modified so that you're flying the &quot;ADMIN's Wrath&quot;, which would feature something like quadruple class 10 shield mounts, a special ADMIN powerplant that can't run out of power, and the heaviest weapons possible... to handle those truly stubborn infections of &quot;uncooperative-player-itis&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />Anyway, email me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ArchKaine@gmail.com">ArchKaine@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->, with any specs that you'd like to see, and I'll play around with it and let you know if I can do it <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Hmm, come to think of it, I think I have an idea of how to go about it. Drop me a note black_sabbath, and we'll talk <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />ArchKaine
<br />
<br />PS
<br />If anyone out there has experience with Admin only ships implementation, please let the us know here... I for one would greatly appreciate it. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />Some say ignorance is bliss, I say they're just too blissful to know better.</div>

			<div class="content">:blush: @Ro9ue, thank you for politely regarding me as 'dear brother'. 
<br />yep, yer absolutly right about reading. it gets kinda spotty when you've been up all night. been there on the sleep. 
<br />I'm just impatient for a working 3.5. rebal has been my fav mod since before evo. and now with all this new stuff. I haven't played FL in about a month. I'm making myself wait until this comes out (yes, FL and study time don't go well together) and Calc is still kickin my butt.
<br />ah, well. thanks again for doing all of this.</div>

			<div class="content">Hello guys.
<br />Shaman, glad you're still onboard - I apologize for the wait to date, but it's how things go, I guess.
<br />And Shawn - no prob, my man. Sorry if  i seemed hot-tempered there - I was just in a pissy mood about school. Like I've said, I can hardly wait to play myself, and I, too, am holding out on actually playing  until the mod is released. I have been playing and checking enough to verify that all chages work, so I have not actaully relaxed into the cockpit of a Scylla or Aeolus with the intention of vaping a hoard of enemies in ... gosh, in too long :p But hopefully it won't be too much longer.
<br />
<br />Well, I have to go here in a sec, but might as well spill the beans here:
<br />I have encounted a freakin nasty  problem - a horrid CTD when trying to launch from space from anywhere - <b>anywhere  </b> - in the game <img src=smilies/icon_smile_disapprove.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I know from past experience that the way it crashes indicates there is a problem with a file like shiparch, weapon_equip, or goods.ini's. These are core files of the game, and these casuse a certain kind of server crash that I keep getting here <img src=smilies/icon_smile_dead.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I have been editing all of the custom ships in the past 40 hrs, so I have made more changes than usual (heh, that's an understatment). So I am not sure (i mean, clueless <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) about where exactly this bug is. But I am going to try and find the easiest way to find out in a little while when I wake up.
<br />I'll find the stupid thing, don't worry, but i very well could take up all weekend (<img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> but I really hope not!! It's just too close to being done!).
<br />So as of right now... I'm not sure when this sucker is gonna be done. *heaves huge sigh* Son of a gun. And I think my system clean up just friggin deleted my backup/old files about 5 hours ago, so *rams fist through wall* screwed there, too.
<br />Ay, I need some z's before I keep going here. I'll keep you updated.
<br /> Later, my friends.
<br />
<br />Ro9ue

			<div class="content">Heh, that's a way that'll work. We can give admins a list of ships that we'll make that they can &quot;slip&quot; in. I'll edit some ships or jsut make some 1337 versions of some nice ones. And they'll come with some scary weaps and crazy equipment, too, to maximize their effetiveness in containing unruly freelancers.
<br />
<br />I'm still finding this damn bug, so I'll be back later.
<br />ARGH! EVILNESS and conspiracy to undermine Rebalance's fun! Anyways, peace for now, bros.

			<div class="content">Oy veigh,
<br />
<br />Cripes Ro9ue, sorry about all that nonsense with the files. Hmm, something I've been thinking of mentioning for a while... Why don't we use sourceforge to maintain the mod? We could upload the version that you have to there, then anyone interested in contributing would be able to grab a copy from CVS (concurrent versioning system), make their changes, let you or I know of their changes BEFORE they submit them, then upload as soon as they get the OK. Reason I suggest this is that if something does happen to the files on someone's computer, they can still fall back and re-get the files from sourceforge, and incidentally have the most up-to-date version... Just a thought, I'll look into it more, and get back to you.
<br />
<br />Also, semi-good news. When rebal's ready I'll actually be able to download it, I've discovered that the nearby university allows free access to the internet from its computers, and I am able to use my USB drive <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> So I'm fairly happy. It's also made my programming a little easier <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Anyhoo, I'm also gonna send you the latest version of the text editor that I've been working on, let me know what you think. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
