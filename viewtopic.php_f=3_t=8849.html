			<div class="content">I couldn't find any threads on this so I thought I would open one up.  First off, I must say that I'm very excited about this game and finding this site has really helped fuel my personal hype about FL.  I was a P1 addict until my computer became too powerful to run it.  I was sorely disapointed by P2.  Now FL is amazing... But I digress.
<br />
<br />The main reason for this post is that I was trying to figure out a way to use turrets.  I remember in P1 how the turrets were more or less &quot;automatic,&quot; firing for you whilst you flew the mission.  This made the freighter in P1 very deadly.  If you took control of a turret, the game was set so the ship traveled a straight line while you could fire out the turret.  (This was great for fleeing a nasty pirate ambush if you loaded up a huge rear turret in your Cent and ran like mad...)  
<br />
<br />Here in FL, I'm just not able to efficiently use the turret and fly the ship.  Since you cannot use weapons in cruise mode, what other uses are there for turrets?  So far, I've owned the Defender and found out that the turret is 360 degrees and will fire forward.  What I'm curious about is what anyone else has tried or can think to try as far as freighters and their multiple turrets.  The profit margins out there would definitely make a good freighter worthwhile if they could use the turrets.  
<br />
<br />About the only thing I can think up is to simply stop and become a floating weapons platform, but I haven't tried it yet (scared?  and how...)  Another is to maybe see if you could possibly fly straight without hitting debris or something and try that... not really sure...   So please any help would be great.  
<br />

			<div class="content">You're aware that u can set a waypoint to a destination, dude, and ya ship will head towards that?  Will even navigate ok in a debris field?
<br />
<br />I LOVE being a freighter pilot.  I like to load up all my best weapons on my rear firing turrets, as that's where I see the most action, in my rearward firing arc.  Countermeasures and a Minedropper are essential.
<br />
<br />I've mapped my &quot;Turret View&quot; key to an easily accesible location.  When u get jumped, lock in ya autopilot to the nearest trade lane, swap to turret mmode, and start blasting at the bad guys behind you.  I like to keep switching to the nearest target, as my turrets are usually quitepowerful but have a short range.  If the opportunity presents itself whjere you need to manuever, flick back to normal mode and go from there.</div>

<br />
<br />You could try the inertia trick that I learned on this forum: go to cruise then press Z (default) to shut down your engines, now you can fire at cruise speed. Although you will eventually slow down. Use AB to boost but not until the speed drops below 200.
<br />
<br />Also go into turret mouse flight should help (press h then space). I don't even bother with targeting, just shoot the red dot indicating the lead on each enemy ship.</div>

			<div class="content">in my brief experience, I've only used turret mode when I wasn't in control of my ship.
<br />
<br />And in combat, I generally like to be in control of my ship, because it helps keep bad guys from shooting me <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So that leaves only times when I'm in formation, or waiting to dock at a base / jump gate (which is a pretty brief window).
<br />
<br />And once or twice I have been able to get a kill on a criminal ship in the 8 or so seconds it took to line of for the jump gate, with lucky use of mines and rear-firing turrets.
<br />
<br />Course, i was hoping turrets would autofire (even if poorly) when I first got them, too.
<br />
<br />The good news is that most turrets tend to face forward, so you can dogfight with them pretty well.

I think auto-turrets would have to be a must, along with some of the other great suggestions in other posts....  Perhaps we could get the ball rolling towards Microsoft?

<br />Just a thought...  Carry on with the turret discussions <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I've had some trouble flying the freighters myself.  I tried out a clydesdale in the SP but the Molly's just tore me up right away when I was trying to just fly away from them in turret mode.  However, I'm not entirely convinced that auto turrets would be the answer.
<br />
<br />Really, freighters were meant to haul crap from point A to B, not get into fast dogfights with tons of light fighters and expect not to get eaten up.  But, they put so many turrets on those things that one is really tempted to go out and pick a fight.  I just think that flying a freighter means you gotta deal with the fact that it handles like a pig and it's damn hard to dogfight with.  There's probably some really good means by which to use turret mode and dogfight successfully, just, no one has really come forward, to my knowledge, with the real inside info on this style of flying.
<br />
<br />Next time I get a freighter (I'm in Kusari space now so I might to earn up my level then go back to a heavy fighter), I think I'm going to really put some time into learning how to fly a freighter successfully in a fight.  I'm thinking that it would probably be a bad idea just to go straight through the enemies and sit in turret mode.  At least, that's what I've learned from experience.  I'm thinking that just when you're doing swoops past the enemies, just to get in the extra couple of shots, you could switch to turret mode, use the strafe buttons to avoid a little fire and then, after the pass and extra hits, switch back to mouse flight to turn yourself around and dodge.
<br />
<br />But, like I said, it's just darn difficult to make a large freighter do well against really nimble fighters.  I think auto turrets would just imbalance the game and make them the super ships people always crave but ruin the game.  Right now, barring a really good guide to dogfighting with a freighter, I'd say use them and travel with a convoy if you're not sure on your abilities.  Or, use them online with buddies watching your back.</div>

			<div class="content">I've spent most of my time in freighters, and there's a few things I've learned about turrets.
<br />1.)  Know your freighter.  The bigger it is, the more important it's turrets become.  Not because they turrets become more powerful, but because the ships become less manueverable.  The Rhino is manueverable enough that you can chase a light fighter and do a half-descent job of keeping it targeted.  A Humpback doesn't stand a chance of keeping up - even against a Rhino.
<br />2.)  If you are greatly out-numbered, stick to flight-mode, not turret-mode.  If you're trying to chase down an opponent, it makes you much harder to hit.  Keep rule #1 in mind, however.  If you can't get a target to shoot at, there's no sense just flying around getting shot at - use turrets.
<br />3.)  Never fight unless you have to, or you're certain of victory.  Obviously this doesn't apply if you're taking combat missions.  If your trade lane gets disrupted, target the waypoint and hit F2.  Then switch to turret mode until the cruise engine kicks in.
<br />4.)  If the enemy is using cruise disruptors, fight or flight, it's your call.  I've had about equally dismal success rates with either one.  If you're stuck with a big freighter, chances are you're screwed.  Heavy fighters carry cruise disruptors, meaning they can take the hits and punish you.  Since you can't maneuver with them, you're stuck going in a nice, easily targetable, straight line while in turret mode.
<br />5.)  Just because you're in turret mode doesn't mean you're dead in the water.  You can speed up and slow down to confuse targeting.  You can also strafe left and right.  If you're strafing one direction, be careful about suddenly switching to the other direction.  You might strafe back into incoming fire.
<br />6.)  Slow down to about half speed if you plan on sticking around and using turrets.  This gives you a little defense and keeps fighters from sitting on your tail.  Fighters don't like to slow down.  That means they'll keep overshooting you.  When they do, they're no longer shooting at you - AND they're placing themselves in your powerful forward arc.  If you're going full speed, then you're placing yourself in their forward arc 100% of the time while they chase you.
<br />7.)  If you want to practice turret combat, stick to the New York system.  Your opponents are at their weakest there.  You might take difficulty 1 combat missions to help insure your safety.
<br />
<br />As powerful as the freighters might seem when looking at the numbers, expecting them to perform well in combat is a pipe dream.  They're big, easy targets, that can only bring a few guns to bear on an opponent at any one time.  They're lethal against any opponent who gets in front of them, but that is a rare and treasured moment...often missed by the suprised and excited freighter pilot who can't believe his dumb luck. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
