			<div class="content">Chapter 1 - The Sigma Angle
<br />
<br />BUFFALO BASE, NEW YORK SYSTEM, LIBERTY
<br />Sigma had been working for the liberty rogues for the past couple months, mostly as a Base defender when the Bounty Hunters made a call. Recently he had moved to Buffalo after a run in with Liberty Police Inc. He had made the mistake of thinking he could pirate a transport just outside of Planet Manhattan&#8217;s Sensor range. He had fired a few shots at the transport and a wing of LPI ships came out of nowhere. Before he knew it, his Neural Net was saying &quot;Shields Failed&quot;, and 'Hull Breach Imminent&quot;. He wasn't very well known at the time, so when he made it to the badlands, the rogues didn&#8217;t go out of their way to kill him. 
<br />He had to bribe the station dock commander with every credit he owned to let him in. So Sigma was left with nothing but his ship and himself, and his ship was in no condition to be going anywhere. Somehow, he had gotten into a bar fight one day, and to his and others amazement, he laid a sound thrashing down on the antagonist. So he was then paid a commission to do fighting matches for the entertainment of the base. Sigma wasn't even a large person. In fact, he was one of the smaller ones on the base. His age was a factor in this, Only 16. 
<br />Eventually, he had made enough money to repair and outfit his ship. Sigma's Real passion was flying, not fighting. When he had his ship fixed up, he took an easy mission to get rid of an LPI wing that had been causing some trouble nearby. He returned in record time, less than three minutes on missionand he returned without a single scratch on his ship, and his cargo hold full of the wreckage from the LPI wing. 
<br />He then began his practice of welding the insignia of the ships he killed onto his ship as a trophy. In two months, his entire left wing was covered in LPI insignia, and his right with Bounty Hunters Guild. It added a certain level of armour to his ship, and it made LPI and bounty hunters think twice before engaging.
<br /> It was during this period he acquired his two most prized possessions: His gun and his knife. His knife was about 8 inches in length tip to pommel, and was jet black. The handle was metal with holes in it for a decrease in weight. His gun was unlike any seen before. It was obviously an LPI sidearm at some point, but it had been customized beyond recognition. It now had the power of a Navy rifle, and the refire rate of a machine gun. He always had them with him, especially when he went on small operations to sabotage Xeno outposts. 
<br />It was due to his flying and fighting skills that he was approached by a man named Ursa, or at least that was his call sign. Ursa was also a rogue, but he was a freighter pilot, or so he said to everyone. He revealed to Sigma the true nature of his lumbering hulk of a ship sitting in the buffalo base hanger. It was actually a heavily modified gunboat, a ship that was slow, yet more powerful then 5 normal fighters. He wanted Sigma to help him on a special mission. He would not say the mission, or who it was for, but he promised sigma a large sum of money as compensation. All he knew was that he had to make sure the Major, Ursa&#8217;s ship got safely to the Orion system. 
<br />However there was a problem. Sigma or any other rogue had never even heard of this system. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll show you the way&#8221; was what Ursa said as a retort. An hour later, Sigma, Ursa, and two other ships were on their way to a secret jump hole deep in the badlands.  The other two ships pilots introduced themselves, but sigma didn&#8217;t remember their names. He just wanted to get this done and retire on planet Curacao. 
<br />The 4 ships made their way into the jump hole and popped out in a strange system Sigma had never seen before. They hit their cruise engines and made their way into a small nebula nearby. When they were about halfway there Sigma&#8217;s radar began to show something very strange. It was like a cloud, almost mistakable for the nebula, Except for the fact that it was red, and moving. 
<br />&#8220;You seeing this, guys?&#8221; Sigma sent over the radio. 
<br />&#8220;Yeah, what you think it is?&#8221; Ursa sent back. 
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of this before&#8230; it&#8217;s... oh no&#8230;&#8221; came a response from one of the nameless wingmen. 
<br />&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Ursa. 
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s... um&#8230; well how to explain&#8230;&#8221; 
<br />&#8220;Spit it out, pilot!&#8221; 
<br />&#8220;Its&#8230; mines&#8230;&#8221;. 
<br />&quot;Just mines? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me. All that over mines?&#8221; Sigma responded, sounding very exasperated.
<br /> &#8220;No! These aren&#8217;t normal mines! They&#8217;ll blast you up before you can say boom!&#8221;, &#8220;uh, dude, chill. It&#8217;s just mines. We&#8217;ll go around them. Wait a minute&#8230; unless these mines fire torpedoes, you&#8217;re wrong!&#8221; 
<br />Sure enough, beeps filled the cockpit of all four ships, steadily growing faster, and all four radars showed small red blips moving in for a kill. 
<br />&#8220;GO EVASIVE!&#8221; someone yelled over the radio. The next few minutes were a blur. Exploding ships all around him, sigma continued to dodge blasts coming from every direction as hundreds upon thousands of nomad ships uncloaked. As soon as he possibly could, sigma engaged his cruise engines and attempted to escape the madness. The last thing he heard from Ursa was a single, very clear word over the radio: &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;

			<div class="content">Chapter 2: Tech&#8217;s Disaster
<br />&#8220;Hey! Tech! Stay awake over there, eh?&#8221; Dingo yelled over the com channel at Tech. 
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get iced over here&#8221;. 
<br />&#8220;Yeah, yeah shut up.&#8221; Tech responded. Tech was named for his amazing prowess with anything technological. He flew a freighter, but he had modified it to the degree that it was more of a fighter than anything. 
<br />Dingo, his wingman flew a stock Outcast heavy fighter, as he didn&#8217;t know how to wire a circuit. 
<br />&#8220;Only two waypoints left&#8230; then it&#8217;s back to Malta and a reload on Cardamine!&#8221; whooped Dingo. 
<br />&#8221;ugh, you know that stuffs going to kill you right?&#8221; said Tech. he was the only outcast who didn&#8217;t rely on the drug. 
<br />&#8220;Ha-ha! Yeah, but we all die sooner or later!&#8221;. Dingo was going to die sooner. 
<br />The two ships were coming up on a small cloud that surrounded the Outcast graveyard.
<br />&#8220;Hey, look sharp. We don&#8217;t want to get caught unawares in here.&#8221; snapped Tech. There were a few dead outcast ships with their pilots in them, a graveyard of outcasts that had lost their lives doing the thing they loved. 
<br />Tech often had an urge to try and loot these ships, but to do so was to have a death wish when he returned to Planet Malta, as the outcasts always knew when there was a grave robber afoot. Soon Tech and Dingo came up to their second last waypoint, near the gravesite. It had been rumored that there were strange angel-like beings that guarded the area here. 
<br />&#8220;Hey lets see if we can&#8217;t find some of them angels here.&#8221; Suggested Dingo. 
<br />&#8220;Well, we DO need to get back to Malta someday you know, Ding&#8221; replied Tech.
<br />&#8220;oh, c&#8217;mon it&#8217;ll only take a minute!&#8221; Dingo headed into the cluster of ships. 
<br />&#8220;Hey! Come back! They might not be the most friendly of things, you know!&#8221; Tech followed Dingo into the cluster. 
<br />&#8220;C&#8217;mon man! Lets go.&#8221; There was no answer. 
<br />&#8220;Ding? Hey where&#8217;d you go man? Ding?&#8221; nothing 
<br />&#8220;Ding! Respond!&#8221;  Still nothing
<br />&#8221;Ding! DIINNNG!&#8221; Tech flew around frantically, searching for his friend, seconds stretched to minutes, as the harsh reality of losing one of his best friends began sink in. Tech finally came to his senses and decided that it would be a good idea to leave when his radio was flooded with heavy laughter 
<br />&#8220;ha-ha! Tech you fell for it! You really fell for it! You&#8217;re pretty slow man!&#8221; came Dingo&#8217;s voice over the radio. 
<br />&#8220;DINGO! You bastard! You&#8217;re lucky I don&#8217;t shove a torp up your pipe!&#8221; tech scolded.
<br />&#8220;Oh, c&#8217;mon buddy it was all in fun! Hey, uh, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; Ding sent back. 
<br />&#8220;Oh, c&#8217;mon i'm not falling for another one lets go.&#8221; 
<br />&#8220;No really, tech, you seeing this?&#8221; tech glanced at his radar screen and saw something very strange. 
<br />&#8220;Huh? The field must be playin&#8217; with our scanners. Lets go before they send out a search party&#8221; tech said, knowing full well that the outcasts would never do such a thing. 
<br />They were about to leave when Dingo did get a torpedo up his pipe, but it didn&#8217;t come from Tech&#8217;s ship, as tech's ship  was exploding at the same time. Tech responded almost like clockwork, hitting his ejector as his cockpit exploded around him, burning and cutting his body up into a mass of blood, bone and flesh. The last thing he was aware of was a flurry of beautiful blue angel-like ships flying in front of the view port of his escape pod.
