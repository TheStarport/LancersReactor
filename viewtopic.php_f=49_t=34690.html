			<div class="content">Okay first the following storie can be disturbing to say the least but it is TRUE also i have changed the name sof everyone and i Refere myself as DSQrn so you know anyhoo without further delay a shocking childhoodd story
<br />
<br />My Beef With Reed
<br />
<br />Well it all started when i was leaving kindergarten. at the end of the school year they told us who would teach us grade 1. i got the worst teacher in the school she screamed and hit kids and soemhow got away with it. so my parents transfered me.
<br />Now at First Reed and his Wife Rachel were nice and kind people who ran a small private school. until grade three i was happy there. now Rachel taught the kids Grade 2 and below an Reed taught the Grades 3-6. i was in grade three and was moving ot the next level.
<br />That year i was labled a rebel and a distruber of the peace. now i would never stand for something i believed is unfair. so this tended to get in trouble. for one year i sorta was the bad kid all the youngfer kids aspired to be like. and most would be proud but im sorta sorry i did what i did. i guess you could call it a kid mafia.
<br />my resources and itelect being highe then the younger kids i decieded to run a small biz during our recess at a park. so i hired two tough grad 2 to be my enforcers and for chump change and candy i ran the younger kid kingdom.
<br />but then the &quot;War&quot; started. and i was not so fit for that. the older &quot;Reed&quot; kids would go to the ileagal ravine behind the park and fight with sticks. me being the &quot;Bad&quot; kid i went. 
<br />alot of kids got hurt and it was pretty aful. but i realized (Being a true Biz man) that running the younger kids was not enough. now one of the big bullies and losers of the grade 5's was bugging my friend.
<br />this was my chance so i did a triple punch to the kids nad's and he went down. so i had the grade three's and four's respect to say the least. things were going pretty good for me. then my rebel days were numbered.
<br />
<br />I will contuine soon!</div>

			<div class="content">Chapter 2
<br />
<br />Well it Reed was not a happy person and more then i ever imagined was brewing. he started to get angry very angry and we suspected something was wrong but being young we didn't have a clue. he started side tracking our classes and getting moree and moe upset. but biz was biz and i contuined. finaly as i saw it the cops closed on the joint and i went to trial.
<br />
<br />and boy were they pissed. but i never hurt anyone i simply ran a biz were i sold things to the younger kids (things they weren't allowed.). now you all would think i was the bad guy but a better term is a rbel without a cause. 
<br />and it was funny i never realized how sick mike was. he started throwing me out of class supsending me little to none reasons. so i rebelled i rouned up about all the kids (there were about 37) and told them that we ought to break all the rules and that the teachers had no power. he raised hell i wouldn't call it glorius it was aful to be exact .
<br />
<br />So finaly enough was enough in the middle of class me and Reed started yelling at eachother and i left the room i walked away.i toned things down a bit and the school year ended. the next year i came back and things were changing. Reed's mood shifts were getting bad and ugly.
<br />
<br />i of course changed a bit. i didn't want all this trouble. me and three friends created a artistic group. (it still exists and its website will soon be up with a FL arm.) we were the tough kids the bad boys agian. but we didn't deserve that rep. but then Reed started challenging me provking me so i took action i rounded up the Group (called bobcrew by the way) and we started to cause trouble. my grades plummeted and things took a turn for the worse. Reed ordered my parnets to take me to a child pcyhatrist. then it all exploded one fat full after noon in a school trip to a book store.
<br />
<br />Reed yelled &quot;how many of you think thi duck is gay&quot; he said holding a book with a duck in it &quot;9 out of ten people are gay that means one of you will be gay. you try to xcept it but you cant&quot;
<br />
<br />i got worse i stopped doing work asigned by him. then one after noon i was his B-day and we all had cake. two kids went for more cake and he screamed &quot;NO MORE CAKE&quot; and threw it out. it turned out he never knew he was gay and he left the school and his wife.
<br />
<br />Next yeared i did very well save a few run ins with the french teacher were my parents ppulled me out.  then after a few years kids started to talk and now we ahve enoug evdence to arest him and sue him. i felt out the very disturbing parts. (if you really want to know you can email me.) but trust me the guy was sick! he still huants me and others to this day.</div>
