			<div class="content">This happens with custom ships- nothing i can do sorry. The LOD (level of detail) ranges are obviously okay cause you see it in cut scenes and whilst flying - so therefore it is at certain angles that it doesn't show up. You can have a look in the files for it if you like, check in shiparch.ini file for the ship entry (I have no idea what it will be called) and then check the entry for LOD_ranges = you should see two values, 0 and 9999. If you see 0, 200 for example, then change the second one to 9999.....</div>

<br />
<br />When you say &quot;get rid of New York&quot;, do you mean change it for another system or completely remove it?  Renaming systems is harder so &quot;remove&quot; New York you can:
<br />
<br /><b>1. </b> Remove the system + details from DATA/UNIVERSE/universe.ini - just search for Li01.
<br />
<br /><b>2. </b> Then remove all the gates + jump holes leading to the system.  The adjacent systems are Texas, Colorado, California and Alaska, but there are obviously other systems with jump holes leading to NY.  Again, search your UNIVERSE folder for Li01 and you should get them all.  
<br />
<br /><b>WARNING!!! </b>
<br />I haven't tried this, and removing the New York system may screw up the nav map etc.  If it doesn't work you could possibly just do step 2, and make the player start in another system so they never discover NY.</div>

			<div class="content">Just a note: Someone in the last topic asked about getting a Lightwave 3D model into Freelancer... <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=15008&amp;forum_id=29&amp;Topic_Title=%2A%2A+Tutorial+%2A%2A+Lightwave+3D+to+Freelancer&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Editing+Tutorial+Forum&amp;cat_title=Freelancer+Editing&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank>Tutorial I posted like 10 months ago</a>. Covers the entire exporting process, including texturing and hard-points. (Now we just need .sur files...)
<br />
<br />My question: I'm creating a new faction. I understand most of it, and most of it is explained in topics like this one. (Which has been a BIG help!) However, for my new faction, I want to add custom pilot voices from new WAV files. How do I get my milita pilots (with both male and female voices) to use the new wav files for the proper comm messages? (They need to talk to you, scan you for contraband, and react accordingly.) I've been trying to figure it out with no luck so far...

			<div class="content">This question is for you program writing folks out there. Would it be possible to write a program that sits in the background and detects any time that freelancer goes into a &quot;loading&quot; period? And could this program then reach into the goods.ini file and multiply all &lt;price =&gt; lines values by a randomly generated # with a value of, say, .85 to 1.15 ? 
<br />
<br />In this manner we could get a dynamic commodity market running in freelancer. 
<br />
<br />I would do this myself but I haven't any programming knowledge, and looking at the c++ for dummies book I picked up at the library has left me completely confused.
<br />
<br />New thought: If frellancer doesn't look at goods.ini when it loads you into a new base, maybe it looks at market_commodities.ini and prices of goods for sale could be changed by modifying the values at the and of the lines?

			<div class="content">Hey Chips: Thanks! It tooke me a while, but I finally found his site. Then it took me a long time to FIND the tutorial... Personally, I didn't like the way he wrote it.
<br />
<br />But it DID connect the missing dots I needed. If I can get it working, I'll work on writing up a nice, clean tutorial on it.
<br />
<br />Again, thanks!

<br />Thats a good idea, I could do most of it, but I haven't a clue how to check if FL is loading.  It could be set to happen every 10mins or so instead, I might give it a go.
<br />
<br />However a &quot;dynamic&quot; economy responds to supply+demand etc., not random values, so it wouldn't really work unless you could keep a track of the number of goods at each station.</div>

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br /> found it.. i see this... LODranges = 0, 900, 1000, 1200, 1500, 2000, 3000, 20000 
<br />
<br />How do i set this then? A friend of mine says i should try 2000 and see if it works and it not lower detail but how do i set this right? can u give me a step by step? let me know.. Thanks i appreciate ur time to read this.. 
<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Okay - make it this:
<br /> LODranges = 0, 9999
<br />
<br />Custom ships only have ONE Level Of Detail setting - after 9999 it will be invisible - but you cannot really see past 2k or so anyways - but this covers you for planets landing parts <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />Good idea for the dynamic commodities idea. But online the loading is done by the server as it loads the systems specs that you are launching into etc......so it would have to communiticate the new values to you as well - which i would have no clue how it would work

			<div class="content">Accu, your idea sounds alot easier. Thanks for taking notice.
<br />I was thinking about the fact that it wouldn't be truly dynamic but simply random. If someone out there knows how to make the program monitor the game then player actions could impact the prices. i.e. &quot;player kills outcast = rise in cardamine prices&quot; &quot;player kills Kusari police = drop in cardamine + rise in engine components&quot; etc.
<br />Any program would have to contain ceiling and floor prices that couldn't be gone past.
<br />Anyway thanks again for taking notice, if you get anywhere with it pls drop me a line and let me know. 
<br />
<br />To Chips: I was thinking in terms of SP. I never even thought of MP because I have super old phone lines in my house and don't play online.

<br />
<br />OKay - this is long and boring <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />First up - faction_prop.ini, initial_world.ini, empathy.ini for the basics..
<br />
<br />first up, you need to think of your nick for your new faction. I use the existing methods of naming, so mine are co_fs_grp - make it what you want (make sure it aint clashing). Backup files (including any dll files you use!)
<br />
<br />Good stuff - you need to make an entry in initial_world.ini file firstly.

<br />That is the outcasts..........change it to your nickname for your faction. Next up you need to then change ALL rep values to what you want your new faction to feel to others. This takes A LONG TIME to work out, so i pick a faction i want it to be like.......and use theirs. Don't forget to add your own factions rep with themselves to this as well (ie add a line to the entry for rep = 0.91, co_fs_grp)
<br />
<br />Next up - you have got to add how every other faction likes yours to their entries (basically stick a 
<br />rep = 0, co_fs_grp or whatever
<br />
<br />Obviuosly change it for how you want them to like yours at the start of game.
<br />
<br />Now then - nearly done.
<br />nickname = fc_ou_grp
<br />ids_name = 196874 ;- this is the long name - like liberty police or whatever
<br />ids_info = 66208 ;- this is the inforamtion - tells you who they like/hate
<br />ids_short_name = 196922 ;-Shortned version - for Liberty Police it says Police, for Liberty Rogues it says Rogues......you get the idea - the one you see in the hud on radar <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />You might need the FLED IDS tutorial for that. Its in  downloads or the tutorials section as well.
<br />
<br />Okay - moving onwards. Save that file off.
<br />
<br />NOw go to the empathy.ini file.(missions folder).
<br />Okay - this is how the changes for factions reps to you are. So if you shoot a cop, the pirates start to like you more, and pirates hate you more oh arrrr...

<br />empathy_rate = gd_z_grp, 0
<br />empathy_rate = gd_bh_grp, 0.050000
<br />
<br />Okay - +ve values are good changes - they like you more, -ve values are that they dislike you more.
<br />
<br />Okay - these are easy:
<br />empathy_rate = gd_bh_grp, 0.050000 - means that they change +vely with this faction (liberty police). So if you are pleasing liberty police by doing things for them, you will get a better rep with the bounty hunters as well.
<br />The -ve of course is the opposite, their reps change for the worse as you please lib police, and change for the better as you piss the police off! That is what the empathy rate is about. So if you make a faction like that but with total positive values - it means that if you do anything for this faction, everyone will start to love you for it.
<br />
<br />On the ohter hand, you then have to add an empathy line for EACH faction here as to how your rep with the new faction changes in respect to doing things to other factions. Confused? Well - you need to add a line for YOUR faction to EVERY factions empathy part. Add it for HOW your new faction should feel if you did stuff for the faction its added to. So if you add it to lib rogues, how should the new faction feel if you do missions for the rogues? They are going to be happy, then you want a positive value like this:
<br />empathy_rate = co_fs_grp, 0.050000
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay - once you have done that (about an hour if your dedicated <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), save it off
<br />Now - to make ships for your faction to fly basically <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<h3><a href="#p257314" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Firstly we go to the shiparch.ini You NEED to look at the ship your going for here. 
<br />So, pick the ship. What are you looking for when picking the ship. 
<br />
<br />You need to know
<br />a) The EXACT NICKNAME as it is in the ini files as.
<br />b) The EXACT WEAPON HARDPOINTS (like HpWeapon01 to HpWeapon06)
<br />c) EXACT mines, counter measure and more points.
<br />
<br />Okay - got one? Good. Well, will use a nice simple one for starters. Lets use the eagle. Here is some stuff from its entry (sorry, i like giving examples <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /><b>EXTRACT OF ENTRIES  </b>:
<br />
<br />nickname = ge_fighter6
<br />shield_link = cv_fighter6_shield01, HpMount, HpShield01
<br />hp_type = hp_gun_special_10, HpWeapon01, HpWeapon02, HpWeapon03, HpWeapon04
<br />hp_type = hp_gun_special_9, HpWeapon01, HpWeapon02, HpWeapon03, HpWeapon04, HpWeapon05, HpWeapon06
<br />hp_type = hp_elite_shield_special_10, HpShield01
<br />hp_type = hp_thruster, HpThruster01
<br />hp_type = hp_mine_dropper, HpMine01
<br />hp_type = hp_countermeasure_dropper, HpCM01
<br />hp_type = hp_turret_special_10, HpTurret01
<br />hp_type = hp_torpedo_special_1, HpTorpedo01
<br />hp_type = hp_torpedo_special_2, HpTorpedo01
<br />
<br />Looks a bit strange don't it? I took out all the class 1 - 8 at least of weapons, shields and turrets. Why? cause it doesn't matter about lower ones, i just care WHAT mounts are there, and also how high in class they go up to* 
<br />
<br />So you know we have 
<br />1 x Thruster (HpThruster01)
<br />1 x Mine (Hpmine01)
<br />1 x Counter Measure (HpCM01)
<br />6 x Weapons (HpWeapon01, HpWeapon02, HpWeapon03, HpWeapon04, HpWeapon05, HpWeapon06) - class don't matter for now
<br />1 x Turret (HpTurret01)
<br />1 x Shield (hpShield01)
<br />
<br /><b>*  </b>For NPC's you can mount class 10 guns on class 1 mounts,its not a problem, i just like to keep things realistic
<br />
<br />The rest? Screw it - this is all we want <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Okay - so we know the ship you want them to fly? Don't sigh, this is slow and detailed so EVERYONE can enjoy it. If you already know most of this - then zoom right ahead! lol
<br />
<br />Okay - good stuff. Next thing - you need to know WHAT type of ship is it? 
<br />type = FIGHTER
<br />So its a fighter. does that matter? Yes it does - for several reasons!!
<br />So what are the other classes? 
<br />type = FREIGHTER
<br />type = CAPITAL
<br />type = TRANSPORT
<br />type = MINING
<br />
<br />
<br />So - there we go. We know its a fighter. Like you wonder - does that matter? yep - it sure does, and here is why.
<br />
<br />We have the ship - but where do we say what it will have ON it? In the loadouts.ini file......well, loadouts.ini IF you are a fighter for Freighter!!
<br />However, for capital ships you would build it in the loadouts_special.ini, for transports and miners - in the loadouts_utility.ini file. So there we go - first problem, make sure you get the right place <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Anyway - ONWARDS TO THE LOADOUTS.INI FILE!!!
<br />
<br />So - we have to build a loadout for it. This is just so the game knows what will be on the ship that they are flying. Obviously you can create MANY loadouts here! not just one. 
<br />
<br />So - what we need - well, all the info we found out of course!!!
<br />
<br />First up - lets see what you need for a loadout! For a player ship - you do this in the goods.ini file - and it needs three things. Engine, power, scanner. For NPC's, well, it needs nothing really - but they don't kill/shoot/move/maim/do anything. They just sit in space. So - what have we got?
<br />
<br />[Loadout
<br />nickname = gd_im_ge_fighter6_loadout01<b>;NICKNAME - must be unique  </b>
<br />archetype = ge_fighter6 - <b>;Familiar? - its the shiparch.ini nickname EXACT!  </b>
<br />equip = ge_bwe_engine_01 - <b>;the engine  </b>
<br />equip = npc_shield03_mark08, HpShield01<b>;its shield  </b>
<br />equip = infinite_power <b>;power supply  </b>
<br />equip = ge_s_scanner_02<b>;scanner  </b>
<br />equip = ge_s_tractor_01<b>not the one you drive, but tractor in loot!  </b>
<br />equip = ge_s_thruster_01, HpThruster01<b>;thruster  </b>
<br />equip = armor_scale_2 - <b>;armor - makes their hulls stronger  </b>
<br />equip = gd_im_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon01<b>;boom sticks  </b>
<br />equip = gd_im_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon02 <b>;&quot;  </b>
<br />equip = gd_im_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon03 <b>;&quot;  </b>
<br />equip = gd_im_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon04 <b>;&quot;  </b>
<br />equip = gd_im_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon05 <b>;&quot;  </b>
<br />equip = missile01_mark03, HpWeapon06 <b>;missile  </b>
<br />cargo = missile01_mark03_ammo, 20 <b>;the shots for missile!!  </b>
<br />equip = gd_im_turret01_mark03, HpTurret01<b>;turret  </b>
<br />equip = cruise_disruptor01_mark01, HpTorpedo01<b>;Cruise disruptor  </b>
<br />cargo = cruise_disruptor01_mark01_ammo, 5<b>;ammo for it  </b>
<br />equip = mine01_mark01, HpMine01<b>;mine launcher  </b>
<br />cargo = mine01_mark01_ammo, 20<b>;ammo for mine  </b>
<br />equip = ge_s_cm_01, HpCM01<b> ;counter measure flare launcher  </b>
<br />cargo = ge_s_cm_01_ammo, 20<b>;ammo for it!  </b>
<br />equip = LargeWhiteSpecial, HpHeadlight<b>lights from here down - who cares?  </b>
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight01
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight02
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight03
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight04
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight05
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight06
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight07
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight08
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight09
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight10
<br />equip = contrail01, HpContrail01
<br />equip = contrail01, HpContrail02
<br />equip = contrail01, HpContrail03
<br />equip = contrail01, HpContrail04
<br />equip = DockingLightRedSmall, HpDockLight01
<br />equip = DockingLightRedSmall, HpDockLight02
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay - so get rid of the lights for now - cause they don't matter, and you don't want to be mounting lights on things that don't exist. IF you are doing this on custom ships, you will need UTF editor, open it up and SEE what mounts its got, then you can put them in. Okay - for now though - that is an example here. 
<br />
<br />[Loadout ;lets game know that ship loadout is below this thing. It also defines end of one loadout and beginning of another. 
<br />
<br />nickname = gd_im_ge_fighter6_loadout01<b>;NICKNAME - must be unique  </b>The reason why this MUST be unique is that it will confuse and crash the game if its not. This is how things are identified in the game. It identifies ships models by the nickname in the shiparch.ini files - which also tells it what mounts etc. This loadout means that if you put loadout = this nickname in another file, it finds ALL that we have in this loadout <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />ship - very very important. This is where the shiparch.ini ships nickname needs to be put EXACTLY. This means that the loadout is for that ship. DO NOT GET THIS WRONG!The loadout is then equipment mounted on the ship. You can work out what they are all for. It doesn' matter too much about the different types - but if you are replacing them, ONE spelling mistake or error, and its crash time!!
<br />
<br />Be careful. Okay - what you need to give them to make them worthwhile
<br />1 - Engine. WIthout this they cannot move!
<br />2 - Power - without this they cannot shoot, OR move.
<br />3 - Scanner - if you fail to give them a scanner they NEVER shoot you - why? cause they cannot see you.
<br />4 - Weapons - without these - whats the point. Note that IF you give them missiles of mass destruction that they WILL need ammo. They cannot buy it or work out they need it, you have to GIVE it to them here!
<br />5 - Thruster - without one of these they are dull as anything to fight.
<br />
<br />Okay - things NOT to do here.
<br />1. give them a torp. It doesn't work okay - i tried. It might be possible to get them using them, infact it probabily is, but i have better things to do with my time then trying to give an NPC a torp he can use.
<br />2. Adding nano bots and shield bats - this won't make them use them OR drop them. Add them if you WANT them to, but they go as cargo like this:
<br />
<br />cargo = ge_s_battery_01, 30
<br />cargo = ge_s_repair_01, 30
<br />Note the comma then the amount of them! That is a necessatiy. See my other threads on newbie questions 2 for how to make them use nano bots and bats.
<br />So - you know what to do eh? thats right - make your loadout. If you care about lights - either find other ships loadouts in this file/goods.ini file - or look at CMP file for what mounts Don't just plug em in and hope
<br />
<br />Okay - so here is a loadout.
<br />[Loadout
<br />nickname = mikes_eagle_loadout01
<br />archetype = ge_fighter6
<br />equip = ge_bwe_engine_01
<br />equip = npc_shield02_mark10, HpShield01
<br />equip = infinite_power
<br />equip = ge_s_scanner_02
<br />equip = ge_s_tractor_01
<br />equip = ge_s_thruster_03, HpThruster01
<br />equip = gd_z_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon01
<br />equip = gd_z_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon02
<br />equip = gd_z_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon03
<br />equip = gd_z_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon04
<br />equip = gd_z_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon05
<br />equip = gd_z_gun01_mark05, HpWeapon06
<br />equip = gd_z_turret01_mark03, HpTurret01
<br />equip = cruise_disruptor01_mark02, HpTorpedo01
<br />cargo = cruise_disruptor01_mark02_ammo, 50
<br />equip = mine01_mark05, HpMine01
<br />cargo = mine01_mark05_ammo, 50
<br />equip = ge_s_cm_03, HpCM01
<br />cargo = ge_s_cm_03_ammo, 50
<br />
<br />okay - mine have decent mines now (screamer) lots of ammo for them, hornet cruise disruptors and adv counter measures. They also have class 10 shield, and a decent thruster - mind you, with the infinite power supply, it won't matter what thruster they have. Likewise - engine doesn't matter too much. Okay - so there we go, an eagle loadout for an eagle. now - you can make more if you like. This way you can give your first loadout lighter weapons, and then make several progressively harder loadouts. So they start with crap mines and guns and shield and by loadout 4 you have got rippers, cannonball missiles, firestalker missiles and class 10 shields <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Give them del cids and watch the players vacate omicron gamma <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So - done for loadout eh? Hope you understood that - it was kinda long winded! lol.
<br />
<br />Okay - moving on now. You have a ship, and a loadout. now what you need to do is to TELL THE B**GERS TO USE IT!!(self censorship for kids <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />
<br />Hmm - now we move folders, but make a note of your loadouts nickname, and the ships nickname as in the shiparch.ini file! Now shifting to the missions folder!</div>

			<h3><a href="#p257317" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Okay - so in the missions folder. There are TONS of files here for encounters and more <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />however, we are going to keep this from being mega complicated at the moment, - so we aren't going to be making new classes or anything else here okay!! We are just making a new fighter for some crap outfit- like the xenos <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />okay - so, we need two files in here, and these two are SO closely interwined that they are inseperable. So, we may have do some cross referencing here <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />okay - pop open the npcships.ini file <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />[NPCShipArch
<br />nickname = ku_p_ku_fighter_d9-19

<br />
<br />
<br />There are tons and tons of these things <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Doesn't look good huh?
<br />[NPCShipArch<b>Title header - knows whats coming beneath <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>    </b>
<br />nickname = ku_p_ku_fighter_d9-19<b>the nickname of this   </b>
<br />loadout =ku_p_ku_fighter_loadout01<b>the nickname of loadout in loadouts.ini file   </b>
<br />level = d11 <b>level of difficult - goes to d19
<br />ship_archetype = ku_fighter[bthe nickname of the ship from shiparch.ini file   </b>
<br />pilot = pilot_police_ace<b>pilots - later   </b>
<br />state_graph = FIGHTER<b>ship type - remember?   </b>
<br />npc_class = lawful, class_fighter, d9, d10, d11, d12, d13, d14, d15, d16, d17, d18, d19
<br /><b>lawful or unlawful followed by class of encounter it will be in and then the levels of difficulty he can be in too!   </b>
<br />
<br />So some new, some not eh? Nickname - yet again, so it can find this entry. Other files refer to THIS nickname.
<br />
<br />The loadouts name is the nickname for the loadout in the loadouts.ini file - so that the game sees this, reads the name, then hunts through the loadouts.ini file FOR that nickname. Told you its a reference - and therefore why it needs to be singular <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />The level - this is what level pilots. d1 is dead easy, d19 is hard You know when you see ships flying round with the name and then a 1 or 5 or11 or 19 next to them? this is it here! When your doing missions in gamma against bounty hunters, and you get ones with 17, 18 or 19 next to them, this is the part right here. 19 is the tough guys <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> There is more to this than meets the eye, cause thats not strictly true - but it will do for now <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Ship_archetype - this is the nickname of the ship you chose in the shiparch.ini file AGAIN!! God, this thing checks, double checks and then makes sure don't it <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />State_graph - this is linked to the type of ship it is again. Fighter, freighter, transport etc etc
<br />
<br />Pilot - this is linked to a file called pilots population.ini - and that tells them how good they are at shooting, dodging, evading, manouvering, how long to hold trigger down for, how far to be before attacking, how to attack, what to do if shot, whether to use nano bots and shield bats. So its kinda important. However, that has been done. Further down there are lots of pilots, but generally there are a easy, medium, hard and ace - guess which are the best huh?
<br />Okay - so pick what you want.
<br />
<br />pilot = pilot_pirate_ace
<br />pilot = pilot_pirate_hard
<br />pilot = pilot_pirate_med
<br />pilot = pilot_corsair_ace
<br />pilot = pilot_military_ace
<br />pilot = pilot_police_ace
<br />
<br />By the way - i typed those from memory, so DON'T copy them! I might have spelt it wrong, find them in the file!
<br />
<br />okay - moving on
<br />
<br />npc_class = unlawful or lawful
<br />guess what that is.........yup - for pirates or good guys  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Now - the part after that is relating to encounters again. This is more envolved than you though huh? It gets worse if you are after making TRULY custom ones, we are doing the easy thing here <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Basically - for now, we will stick to class_fighter 
<br />so - what are the d10, d11, d12 etc after things in there? That is also related to the level of difficulty of the pilot in encounters. If it says d9-19 - then if you had an encounter zone which says it wants level 10 ships - this might appear there (as long as you are wanting the kusari police in a fighter of course), but if you say its a level 19 zone, he will STILL appaer there. BUT if it only said D9 instead, then he would ONLY appear in level 9 zones, and NOT in hte level 10 or 19 or 18 etc etc okay <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Okay - so now we kinda know some parts about this. So - what are we doing here then? Well - we are making one of these. SO - lets do it. Military pilots are best along with police (they have better shot accuracy and more).
<br />
<br />So here goes.
<br />[NPCShipArch
<br />nickname = my_eagle_d17-19
<br />loadout = mikes_eagle_loadout01
<br />level = d19
<br />ship_archetype = ge_Figher6
<br />pilot = pilot_police_ace
<br />state_graph = FIGHTER
<br />npc_class = unlawful, class_fighter, d17, d18, d19
<br />
<br />Okay - so do you follow what has happened? Note that my nickname includes the levels that he will be appearing in. This makes it so much easier to work with if you do this, cause then you can hone in on the right level thing to change stuff. If it works - why change it? this makes it easy to reference- so i don't <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />Good stuff. Okay - so we got MY loadout, and the fighter (remember - nickname from shiparch.ini). Uh oh - its unlawful - that is cause i am going to give it to the xenos <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Now then - there we go. IF you had more than one loadout - you could make a range like this, see below:
<br />
<br />[NPCShipArch
<br />nickname = my_eagle_d14-15
<br />loadout = mikes_eagle_loadout01
<br />level = d14
<br />ship_archetype = ge_Figher6
<br />pilot = pilot_police_ace
<br />state_graph = FIGHTER
<br />npc_class = unlawful, class_fighter, d14, d15, d15
<br />
<br />[NPCShipArch
<br />nickname = my_eagle_d16-18
<br />loadout = mikes_eagle_loadout02
<br />level = d17
<br />ship_archetype = ge_Figher6
<br />pilot = pilot_police_ace
<br />state_graph = FIGHTER
<br />npc_class = unlawful, class_fighter, d16, d17, d18
<br />
<br />[NPCShipArch
<br />nickname = my_eagle_d19
<br />loadout = mikes_eagle_loadout03
<br />level = d19
<br />ship_archetype = ge_Figher6
<br />pilot = pilot_police_ace
<br />state_graph = FIGHTER
<br />npc_class = unlawful, class_fighter, d19
<br />
<br />
<br />Now you can see why its so handy to have the loadouts named fairly similar - so its easy to keep track of, and also why the nicknames in this file have the difficulty - its easy to keep track of which is which eh? <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So - will they use this yet? Nope - we have another file to add to at the moment. That file is the faction_prop.ini file - the twin of this one <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Okay - so dive in. this is seperated up by factions okay - so we need to search for our faction. And here are the xenos:
<br />
<br />[FactionProps<b>;title again - it lets the game know its a new part to be read   </b>
<br />affiliation = fc_x_grp<b> the faction name <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>   </b> You put in your new named faction
<br />legality = unlawful<b>;good or bad guys   </b> whatever your faction is
<br />nickname_plurality = plural <b>;plural? Xeno or Xenos when more of them (you don't get polices when more do you?   </b>
<br />msg_id_prefix = gcs_refer_faction_fc_x<b>How they are referred to , so fc_x is the &quot;I am Xenos&quot; voice recording   </b>Yours are best off with nothing, so stick your own name here and it will yeild silence
<br />jump_preference = jumphole<b>Bad guys don't come via jumpgates at the mo
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter_d1-2[binteresting bit   </b> This is where all the names of npcships entries for your faction goes...
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter_d3
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter2_d4-7
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d8
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d9
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d10
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d11-19
<br />voice = pilot_f_ill_m01<b>pilots voices here   </b>
<br />voice = pilot_f_ill_m02
<br />mc_costume = mc_fc
<br />space_costume = pi_pirate2_head, pi_pirate5_body, comm_ge_generic1
<br />space_costume = pi_pirate4_head, pi_pirate5_body, comm_pi_pirate
<br />space_costume = sh_male4_head, pi_pirate5_body, comm_ge_generic1
<br />space_costume = ge_male2_head, pi_pirate5_body, comm_pi_pirate
<br />space_costume = ge_male4_head, pi_pirate5_body, comm_ge_generic1
<br />space_costume = ge_male1_head, pi_pirate5_body, comm_pi_pirate
<br />firstname_male = 226608, 226741<b>names - inbetween numbes as well   </b>
<br />lastname = 227008, 227307<b>ditto, so inbetween these two numbres are all names they use   </b>
<br />rank_desig = 197101, 197102, 197103, 5, 8<b>corporal, captain, idiot if you make it say so  - lol   </b>
<br />formation_desig = 197808, 197820<b>alpha xenos Jon doe - formation alpha when you have pilots in formation - erm, bloody look when playing!   </b>
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_diamonds, 1<b>what they are after  - you can add your own or others here, then they will want it if they scan you and your carrying <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>   </b>
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_food, 0
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_gold, 1
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_H_fuel, 0
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_mox_fuel, 2
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_oxygen, 0
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_pharm, 0
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_sidearms, 2
<br />scan_for_cargo = commodity_water, 0
<br />scan_announce = false<b>no warning - just a drop cargo   </b>
<br />scan_chance = 0.300000<b>30% chance of them scanning you </b>
<br />formation = fighters, fighter_pirate<b>formations that they use   </b>
<br />
<br />Okay - so yes you can add commodities, and the 0 or 1 or 2 is priority of things! If you are carrying 3 things then the one with the 2 behind it is MORe important then the others okay.
<br />Formation - what formation they fly in - check formations.ini - there the fighter_pirate will specify how far apart and other stuff.
<br />
<br />okay  - the npc_ship = is the part we are interested in okay. This is the meat and bones, and you guessed it, each of those refers to a npcships.ini file nickname okay.So you can see that there are some already there for the levels - but who cares, as longs as ours is named differently - its fine <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Okay - so you can put yours in there. Now you can see how they are all linked! they are also linked via the encounters parameter - but my stubbs that used to be fingers are actually getting some blisters on the end i think!! lol - too much typing <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />okay - add yours in there then! SO you get this:
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter_d1-2
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter_d3
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter2_d4-7
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d8
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d9
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d10
<br />npc_ship = fc_x_ge_fighter4_d11-19
<br />npc_ship = my_eagle_d14-15
<br />npc_ship = my_eagle_d16-18
<br />npc_ship = my_eagle_d19
<br />
<br />Now your done. Now you need to edit an encounter in system of theirs so that higher classed Xenos popup. Yours will be mixed in with the normal ones - like the hawks cause they STILL have those there. Don't worry thouhg - you can change that <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Put YOUR loadout into that npcships.ini part, add YOUR ship archetype part in, and bingo - done. I personally edit the nickname to be d11-13, and then do the same in the npcships - also taking down the d14, d15, d16, d17, d18, d19 part as well, and leaving it as d11, d12, d13. Then i make mine go from d14 -  19 instead, and have about three loadouts. 
<br />
<br />As you may have guessed, i copied and pasted this part from another thread i did about this stuff <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Also - in case your wondering. If you just take a copy of the xenos part, then paste it to the bottom of the faction_prop.ini file - you can then subsitute the parts you want for your faction - like the ships they are flying, the nickname and stuff, along with names for pilots.
