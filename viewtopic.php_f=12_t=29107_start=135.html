			<div class="content">&lt;&lt;i have enough fierpower on my world to destroy the entire universe 200 times over&gt;&gt;
<br />*COUGH* Godmoder *COUGH*
<br />
<br />Anyway, did you even read my posts- first of all, you don't have a gate in Centuari, and even if you did, my jump-disruptor would rip your gate apart, as well as just about everything within a certain distance, depending on the amount of energy used to activate it.
<br />
<br />Second- my attack on Orillion created a black hole, which, by the way, can destroy anything regardless of size, although mine kinda fizzled out before it could, and it ruptured one of the main power re-routers. If his mothership tried to fire it's guns with this re-router bust, the energy would be released inside the ship, which would almost certainly cause a chain-reaction of explosions that would destroy the ship. 
<br />
<br />Thirdly- my Ring of Fire could easily stop any projectile weapons, regardless of type or strength and so your missiles would be useless against me. This would mean that you would have to use Plasma weaponry. Since your fleet (and your magical fairy gate which seems to be able to magically appear out of nowhere and activate itself despite the fact that if it did, it would instantly destroy itself) would be very far away from my planet, they would have to embark on a thousand year journey,(they would have to travel at sub-light speed) during which they would be under constant firepower from about 3 thousand long range artillery cannons, and completely at the mercy of whatever other weapons we decide to smash you with.
<br />
<br />So, you see, I'm not quite as weak as you think, despite the fact that I don't have any ridiculously huge and impractical warships from which to fire billions of nukes at people, which seems to be your current battle strategy.

<br />This is quite possibly the worst news our great nation has ever faced-
<br />Earth is rebelling.
<br />It seems that they were outraged at how Unity was not taking correct action to protect them from the vile Aranic warfleet. 
<br />After detonating explosives in Unity's embassies, the rebels commandeered our defensive cannons and destroyed our ground forces easily. 
<br />The rebels were assisted by our fleet in orbit which has now pledged allegiance to the New Republic Of Neo-Draconia, which spans almost all of Asia, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. 
<br />The rebels, commanded by the formerly trusted admiral, Arkhov Zhukofski are now trying to negotiate a peace treaty with the twisted empire of Arania and Orillion.
<br />
<br />The Overlord is horrified by these actions, and has made the following statement:
<br />
<br />&quot;I had no idea that this could happen. But it has, and I see now that invading this new republic would be a black mark on Unity, and so has decided to allow the Republic to co-exist with Unity in peace.&quot;

<br />One of the things with RYOC is that you <b>CAN NOT CONTROL OTHER NATIONS   </b>
<br />
<br />&quot;We also launched another attack on Orillion. One T-101 fired it's jumpdrive reactor at the Alpha Centauri hyper gate, thus creating a black hole, which destroyed the OOPS Tyradon as well as the hyper gate and almost a hundred Orillion ships, about 90 of which were fighters and civilian cargo, and ten being a mixture of 4 battleships as well as 5 cruisers and a missile frigate. 
<br />We were able to damage the flagship of the fleet, which we suspect had Orillion on board. It is believed to be en-route to dock for repairs.&quot;

<br />
<br />The Flagship is not in my fleet. It's stationed in Orillan Alpha. Im not aboard, im in a secret location, and thus, neither i or the Flagship was damaged.
<br />
<br />We have decided to launch EVERYTHING  we have on you. Here follows a list:
<br />
<br />3 million fighters
<br />4 million frigates
<br />30 Motherships
<br />150000 Planet Destroyers, equiped with Planet Extermination Fusion Rail Guns (PEFRG's)
<br />1 Asao Defender (from my homeplanet). This ship, is as big as a whole system...
<br />13000 Carriers (Each with 2000 intreceptors)
<br />
<br />If you don't surrender or ally us in 2 hours, you will be assimilated. 
<br />
<br />End transmission.

<br />As the flimsy plasma shots bounce off the reinforced hulls of the ships, merely strengthened by the blasts, the fleet gave everything they had into attacking unity. As the Emperor sat in his modified APC-X starfighter, he felt a pang of guilt as he saw the combined forces of The Coalition, The Orillan imerial navy, and The entire Aranic fleet lay waste to unity.*

<br />Has this this thread <img src=smilies/icon_smile_dead.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> without me?! I was only gone for 3 bloody days!<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Ah, well. *Gets out shovel*
<br />
<br />One hour before the Coalition attack-
<br />
<br />&quot;This the Overlord. All men are to report to designated sleeper ships. Evacuation plan Corsair-01 is in action. Abandon all possessions. Attack is imminent.&quot;
<br />End transmission
<br />
<br />Five minutes minute before the attack-
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Admiral Damien. Where are the sleeper ships from sections A10-A15? 
<br />We'll have to leave without them. They should be all right. Not even Arania would be twisted enough to kill a billion unarmed and fleeing civilians...
<br />All right. All T-101s are to escort the sleepers. We'll head to Sol, then meet up with Zhukofski's sleeper fleet (when Sol heard of the attack and our plans to evacuate they immediately re-allied themselves to me) and head to our new home. Wherever it is...&quot;
<br />*The fleet jumps out. Jump-disruptors had to be turned off, thus allowing the Coalition fleet to enter Unity Space*
<br />
<br />-Unity Defence Transmission-
<br />
<br />The fleet has broken through our defenses! The Ring Of Fire was completely destroyed. All people in this sector- surrender to Arania. You can still save yourselves!
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Arania never gave them the chance. Around a billion people were still on Unity when it was blown to pieces by Arania and his allies. 
<br />
<br />Unitarian Fleet- Overlord Corsair#01 official statement:
<br />
<br />&quot;We have made rendevous with Zhukofski. Our forces now stand at 8 hundred T-101s and two thousand sleeper ships. We were able to save almost ten billion people from the jaws of death- we should be proud. But we mustn't ever see this as a victory. We must remember the ultimate sacrifices that were made so that we could still be alive today- not only the civilians that were massacred by Arania, but also the soldiers that managed to hold off Arania for those crucial few minutes. And now, thanks to them, we can look forward to our future, and our new home. We haven't decided yet on where it will be, but it must be far from the pointless slaughter over this war, from the plague of misery that hath befallen our people. And of course, it must have adequate food and atmosphere...&quot;
<br />
<br />Now, for other matters:
<br />@Arania- how did you possibly offer me the &quot;right path&quot;??!!
<br />You went to war with me because I reverse-engineered a bloody cloaking device!!!!!!!!!
<br />Then, when the war began, I made several attempts to negotiate with you and you repeatedly ignored me!
<br />
<br />@Orillion- TWO HOURS?! What the hell kind of ultimatum is that?!
<br />
<br />@Everybody- I hope we can still negotiate an end to this- although I am NEVER surendering my technology. It is the only possible way I can survive an attack.
<br />And something tells me you're gonna be launching a lot of those.
<br />And anyway, perhaps you should think a little before attacking people!
<br />I mean, you killed a billion unarmed civilians as well as about a thousand army men. Does that constitute a victory in your eyes?!
<br />And anyway, why did you invade me in the first place?! 
<br />Because I salvaged (not stole, you understand- salvaged. From an INVASION force) an Aranian cloaking device?!
<br />And you think I'M homicidal?!
<br />
<br />Besides, know this- we will never forgive you for your unprovoked slaughter of 100,00,00,00 people. You may have been able to smash our defenses, but there was a reason. The Ring of Fire was designed to hold off hundreds, thousands if neccessary ships. Obviously the arrival of over 20million warships caught us off guard somewhat, but next time we will be ready- our black-hole missiles are nearing the end of testing. We will, of course, only use these weapons in strict defense. Unlike certain other nations we do not take pride in unprovoked aggression, although of course, you have done plenty already to provoke your destruction. We are still hopeful for peace. Even if you are not.
<br />
<br />-END MESSAGE-
<br />
<br />EDIT- Spelling, and some stuff I forgot to include.

			<div class="content">As the command flagship 'Homerunner' Flew across the decimated landscape of unity, every single ship in orbit stopped shooting.
<br />
<br />The dropships following the flagship broke formation and flew towards a massive city, decimated by the orbital assault, but miraculausly, still standing, Orbital scans had shown that everyone left on the planet was inside this city.
<br />
<br />The flagship hovered overhead, scanning the city as millions of heavily armoured robotic soldiers stormed the city, meeting no resistance.
<br />As a massive, cusom built warship landed outside the city, the robot army escorted hundreds of unitarian citizens into the ship.
<br />
<br />The ships lifted up of the planet and slowly flew into orbit.
<br />
<br />A transmission was heard from the supertransport: 'He wasnt in the city, records indicate he left with a sleeper fleet, destination not recorded'
<br />
<br />The flagship replied: 'Take the prisoners back to Arania, interrogate them, and them put them into the SR systems, ill deal with them there'
<br />
<br />'What about unitaria?'
<br />'Does it have any resources of value?'
<br />'No Emperor'
<br />'Destroy it then, let the ashes of neo-draconia stand as a warning to who will oppose us'
<br />'Yes sir'
<br />
<br />A small turret on the underside of the wordship, smaller than a pistol, turned and pointed at unitaria, it fired a small yellow particle at the planet, which passed unhindered through the atmosphere and impoacted gently on the surface of the batterd planet.
<br />The planet exploded, blown away with such force that nothing survived, as the smoke and dust dissipated, it was seen that it was completely gone.
<br />
<br />Aranic News transmission:
<br />Neo-Draconia has been destroyed, and it has been diagnosed that the overlord poses no immediate threat.
<br />
<br />We have established a firm foothold on earth to maintain peace between the nations, a massive base has been constructed to reinforce Sol from further attack, the base is churning out robotic soldies at an average rate of 50 footsoldiars per second, and a new shipyard has been built in orbit that is second only to that in orbit of Arania itself.
<br />
<br />The fleet in Centuris has been withdrawn, but a signifiacant military presence is still present.
<br />
<br />All 4562 Aranic-Controlled star systems have been reset to medium-Alert status until it can be confirmed that it is unneccesary to have active defences in place.
<br />
<br />Despite significant pressure from the council, The Emperor has decided to NOT declare martial law.
<br />
<br />The Coalition and the Orillan Imperial Navy have been reimbursed for the war with Neo-Draconia and Allegiance ties with them wil hopefully be maintaned for centuries to come.

			<div class="content">Unity News-
<br />
<br />It has been reported by Arania that our people left on Unity have survived the attack. We are thankful for this, but considering the indiscriminate nature of the attack, and the fact that the survivors were in fact located in five different areas, each being about the size of Africa, and in almost 500 different cities each with a pretty sizeable distance between each other, we are almost certain this is nothing more than propaganda.
<br />What is more likely is that, even if they did survive, the life they will lead will be significantly shortened by the whip of Arania's guards.
<br />
<br />
<br />HOME
<br />
<br />This is a word our people have rarely seen the use of, being constantly attacked and forced to leave under a hail of firepower. It is hoped by all Unitarians that this time time, things will be different.
<br />
<br />This morning, our long range scanners on board the OOPS Forerunner (following the destruction of the T-101 Kraken at the battle of Unity Prime, we made the Forerunner our new flagship) detected a VAST planetoid, around a thousand times the size of Earth and about four times the size of Unity. While there is no life on the planet itself, there is four other planets in the system which, by some strange twist of nature all share a near identical orbit of the system Sun, which we have named Bulbo. Their orbit is a strange one: they start of near the sun, then gradually move away. This process takes about 100 years, and basically means that, these planets move from being a rainforest to a vast frozen plain. This has given our scientists much to work on.
<br />
<br />Planetfall was made within a day. First we deployed nanobots, which built houses, pump out gas to form an atmosphere, planted plants and released some animals. Then we dropped the people. We are now working to consolidate control over the region. Black hole torpedo launchers are on standby.
<br />
<br />We are calling the new system Corsairea#51.
<br />
<br />EDIT- And by the way, my world is NOT called Unitaria. My people are called Unitarians, but our territory is defnitely still called Unity.
<br />
<br />@Stormtrooper- your support for my people is heartwarming.
