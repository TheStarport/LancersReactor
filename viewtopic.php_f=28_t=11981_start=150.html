			<div class="content">I went to play Freelancer with some other mods and it kept closing out after the 2nd screen with Freelancer on it.  I disable all mods and tried again and it still messed up.  I did the restore backups and delete autosave.  Still crashed.  I enabled the reyen mod, it worked again.  Disabled it, crash again.  I finally just uninstalled completely (1st time without save games, on install game still crash), 2nd time everything uninstalled.  After install it worked again.  While i was in the reyen mod i deleted all saves made during it, but it seems the saves were the problem.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Reyden, 
<br />
<br />Thanks for the MOD, all the new ships and stuff sounds cool. 
<br />
<br />I read in the sneak preview for 1.6 that you may want to do away with the regenerating shield for AI. Maybe you shall just lower it so that the regenerating rate is the same as the player's Shield?
<br />
<br />Secondly, the single-player mission plays too slow. The first battle takes way too long (10 minutes) compared to the unmodded Freelancer. I think it may be the AI's regenerating shield, or the NPC are, as you said in the readme.txt, not doing enough damage. The other parts of the beginning mission get draggy quick - the player is invincible, the enemies are almost invincible...and I seem to be the only one doing the work...
<br />
<br />I would suggest putting the starter ships at Plant Pitsburg so that player could immediately switch to a new ship after the mission 1a - at least they could ditch the Starflier soon and get to experience the new ships you have created.
<br />
<br />Just my opinions.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi again Reynen. I've played your mod in 1.5 almost trough entire SP campaign and here are some problems i'v come up against: 
<br /> As I said before te NPC's both allied and enemies do ZIP damage against u and each other. Two factions cand fight for one hour without any casualty...<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).But when and if U are going to upgrade the guns damage or NPC loadout be careful to upgrade the armor of the craft that appear in missions, as the large train transport, armored transport, and the battleships + cruisers. I was able to take out a RH cruiser in 2 seconds with a Avenger, Devastator&amp; Eliminator combo, plus 2 Cannonball missiles, and a Kusari Battleship in about 7 secs, with a Blood Dragon fighter having 11/1 guns(i have set it up myself when I got to Kyoto). 
<br />Also in the mission where I had to escort that convoy to Willard Station, I got the transports blown away several times, and even the mighty Battleship Harmony was blown to bits in the next mission by RH Valkyries, and that screwed up the hole mission.
<br /> I wonder if anybody played the mission in which U have to go to Tekkagi's Arch with this mod installed? U have to join with Ozu and about 12 Blood Dragons and take out those shield Generators on the Arch. Because as I said before i was able to take out that Battleship guarding the shields in about 7 secs, but the 4 shield generators took me about 40 minutes to destroy. In normal game it only takes 2-3  minutes in the same ship. I think this has to do with the fact that bases are now detructible, because every time i took out a shield generator it seemed like the hole base exploded, probably the shield gens have now the same HP as the entire base...but fortunately the base did not explode or the mission would have been a failure. It was kinda fun but i think U'll probably need a Sabre with 14 guns to get trough this one. Anyway i think this is a bug an has to be addresed. 
<br />To the ones complaining that shields and armors are all the same to all fighers...there is still a difference between different class of shields and that is the thoughness of that shield, which increases with each level, making buying a better class worthy, and the armor varies with each fighter class. 
<br />The Nomad power generators seemed ok though, just passed mission 11, and Nomad Lair gens went down fast...in about 3 secs <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.</div>

			<div class="content">Uhm, dear Renyen,
<br />
<br />as I read your reply to my post I think someone pissed in your cerial this morning, right? You are taking everything like a direct attack on your work or on your person.
<br />
<br />If you can't take any criticism about your super mod, then stop working on it, keep it for yourself or whatever, but stop bitching around like hell. That is not very professional and besides I don't belive that you are able to see what one is running as background programs or that you are able to boot his machine. I personaly also don't think you are working 60+ hours AND on this mod AND bitching in this forum <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Have a nice day and try to not work that hard so you are able to chill down a bit <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />And besides like I have wrote, I have tried your mod and it's not too hard nor it is too easy, for a beginner it just doesn't make any sense. Thx. Oh, I forgot, I get bitched out now since I did some criticism.
<br />
<br />MADMAX24
<br />
<br />P.s.: It is sad how you react like a little 500 pound chocolate smudgy computer crazy child and I hope you grow up. I wonder who would kick whos butt if we could meet in real life <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

			<div class="content">Reynen, i have been playing your mod a little, and it looks very good it has lots of cool features in it that i have always wanted to do, like with the destructible bases and stuff. 
<br /> I have to say looking at and playing it for the first time i was surprized at how powerful everything is compared to the original specs, things do LOTS of             
<br />Damage and shields absorb LOTS of hits and all the ships have loads of HP.
<br />You have you reasons for doing this, and i want to know your reasons, to me(mind that i have no moding exp. i am just a fan of them)that the developers did all the hardware for you with all the weapon stats and such so use them, it will save time and work. 
<br /> Just change the shield ratings and such to make ships stronger or weaker.
<br />also i have yet to get used to the pace of the dogfights now i swear of one mission every pass like 2-3 k was reached between us, i like had to fly to the waypoint like very pass to not abort. 
<br />All that i'm saying is it's hard to keep track of where everything is(i just have to make the ajustment i think from the going 80 max to like 150?? can't remember)
<br /> And to the point that you said how the CapShips will have like 500K hull and stuff
<br />and how a single ship does like 25k and pass and stuff, i think that if you have smaller proportions it will work the same but i think that a single fighter would have NO chance to go at it alone with a Battleship i think you should (if you havn't already)like torpedo bombers and torpedos would be the CapShip killer like it should be, my reasoning is that something that huge nothing that a little ship could power would be able to kill it. so torpedos in groups would be the way to go! my justification is this you don't see machinegun wielding airplane sink battleship it's armor is just proof against bullets. 
<br /> I also think that big CapShip shouldn't be able to use nanobots and they would have monstorus shields but slow recharge(whith the enormous energy it takes to even have a field around the ship it would take a while to build up the power type thing)so maybe like if the shields drop it takes ages to raise the shields again unless they use batteries, instead of making monsterus shields that say have 300k to them you could just mount multipy shields on the bigger ships.
<br />
<br />ok I apologise for the long windedness i sort of let it all come out in one post.
<br />In summery i was just wondering what your take on having all the weapons beefed up. i think it would be easier to keep all the base weapons the same and just add new stuff to them, and perhaps tailor hull and shields up of down to get the effect desired. 
<br />
<br />this is with about 3 hours of exploring your mod in SP 
<br />oh and one last thing the ships look kinda wierd with all the guns everywhere just my opinion, i think it would look cool to have stuff internal like the guns in airplanes and stuff. as i said just an idea. 
<br />
<br />Keep up the good work will be looking forward to playing more, and can't wait to see the CapShips!!!</div>

			<div class="content">Oh one more thing i forgot(is it possible??) is that i have been browsing this forum for the last 2 days at all the mod suggestions and the stuff like SW vs ST vs Bab5 and think that would be cool as hell! and like reynen has several ship mods in one pack and it's cool.
<br />
<br />How ever there seems to be something missing, when i think of massive space battles all the classics movies and tv scifi shows have been said, how ever the coolest of the cool hasn't even been mintioned...
<br />
<br />When i think Epic Space battles i think BATTLEFLEET GOTHIC! Now that would be a cool mod if anyone knows what the ships look like you would agree too!

<br />just throwing out an idea for all you master mod makers out there....</div>

			<h3><a href="#p123848" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">First let me just say that in no way was my post meant to trash your hard work.  I do realize how much you have put into .. not only this MOD, but the enormouse contribution you have added to FLSDK.  
<br />
<br />Please Please Please do not stop contributing to this effort or this forum.  I must have downloaded or looked at about 20 plus tutorials you have posted .  So yes I do have a bit of an idea .. at lease a clue of how hard your MOD was to make.  If I weren't truely impressed I wouldn't have bothered with the first post much less this one.  I have better things to do.
<br />
<br />YES...... jaggoff I did read the readme files....    Have you ever read an article about something or looked at a hyped up add only to have a few minor details ruine the whole experience for you?
<br />
<br />I started M1 as my bro hopped in the shower to get ready for work.  15min later I'm still trying to zero my first bogy.  When I did get one in my sights for longer than 1 tenth of a second..(and thats a long time) my 1500 damage weapon did virtually NIL damage.  I literally had to pause the game to run my bro to work and continue when I got back.  30 min later I had downed 2 ships and the other 3 were gone.. I couldn't even finish the mission.. started over.  
<br />
<br />M1b seemed to go a bit better.. but only because I just throtled down to zero and just sat there and let them come at me.. what the heck I'm invinsible anyways.   that only took about 10 min.  
<br />
<br />Get to Pittsburg.. woohoo.. new weapons and ships...400,000.. no biggie..  I'm happy to try out the new weapons... but at sluggish 2.00 refire for even less damage.. as powerfull  a guns I have now and as fast as those ships are flying I couldn't imagine trying to hit one with that slow a fire rate.
<br />
<br />M2 Prison ship I gave up.think I had to go do something..... don't remember.  Oh.. I took off towards Buffalow to see if I could blow it up and got spanked for leaving the mission.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /> want a screenshot of you going 300 IMPULSE! I want one by tommorow. The ships don't even go that high!
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Your right.... its 199 at full impulse and over 400 at full thrusters..(that last a whole 4 seconds)  I do have the screen if you really want it.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />- All ships both player and NPC have roughly the same shields, armor, and power 
<br />
<br />Where do you get that also! Did you read the readme!!! Not even in the NORMAL game they don't! In the NORMAL game they don't even regen!
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Where did I get that.. hmm.. lets see.. should I post the whole f'n  readme file?
<br />
<br />1.4 	- Some NPC ships have had their layout modified to include the new weapons
<br />	- All ships both player and NPC have roughly the same shields, armor, and power
<br />	- Starflier now starts with 3 guns (click on third gun to activate it)
<br />	- Fixed the bug with the dagger ship
<br />	- New players now start with 20,000.  USe it wisely and buy a starter ship.
<br />
<br />
<br />1.5 	- All sectors now have their full map
<br />	- Modified TIE fighter pack mod has been incorperated, see below for more info
<br />	- Weapon damage has been increased slightly, see below
<br />	- Due to complaints I've reduced the power of the humpback	
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />No regen huh.. must have been someone else that  wrote that big article about battleship regains 100k after 10 seconds 90 seconds to destroy the battleship...  but I was a bit suprised to see ships with half sheilds half hull damage.. 
<br />suppose you want a screen of that too.
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />I can't believe you think the game is uber. LOL.
<br />
<br />I didn't say that.  I said I thought the point of it was not to be.  So it didn't make sense to me why you jacked the numbers up on everthing so high for.. 
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Lowering the bribes...TO ***** LAZY to actually EARN a good reputation! You talk about earning stuff yet you want to easily change your faction.
<br />
<br />I only mentioned it because I never understood why they were always so high.. rarely ever proportionate to your level yet .. according to the dev team.. supposed to be an intragal part of the game.. indeed if I had not bribed someone down in Rheinland or somewhere, I would have never made it to Cadiz or the Corsair homeland.  But in the end is absolutely un-needed.  Just puts more depth in the game.. not laziness.  Not saying make it a dimebag bribe.. but I have 5k and I need 190k to bribe someone.. by tht time I have that kind of cash I don't need to bribe anyone.
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Why dress a freighter like a battleship when I am adding battleships to the game! I AM actually in the process of making a deathstar TYVM!
<br />
<br />You say I jack this mod and it doesn't have content!
<br />
<br />1: What about the new weapons effects! 
<br />2: What about destructible stations! 
<br />3: What about ACTUALLY earning a high level ship!
<br />4: What about ACTUALLY building a good rep with factions instead of buying!
<br />5: What about improved AI that is smarter, deadlier, and better.
<br />6: What about flight and physics dynamics!
<br />7: What about the adding of battlehsips and NEW ships!
<br />8: What about changing the entire universe dynamics!
<br />
<br />All the very  things I was impressed with about the MOD.. but ultimately, and I do see I am not alone on this, the game gets too Monotonous to even get past the first  couple of missions to where I can explore on my own.
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />So make one by Monday that everyone likes.. well.. in case you haven't been  paying attention.. and it looks like you havn't because your so high up on your golden pillar that your head has actually gone round and up your A$$
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />now you hate everyone... want to kill somone.. Kick my ...... have to get your head out of yours first......   If you cant take a LITTLE.. and I mean LITTLE.. constructive critisism.... Then keep your MOD, hardworking, nobody appriciates me bs to yourself.  As it stands the MOD is unplayable to me and I WON&quot;T be playing it....  So There.  nnnuah.....  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  
<br />
<br />Chill dude.  step away from the code a bit...  your like the coders in the cave where I work.. drop a pin on the floor and they throw thier mouse down stomp out of the room and get another cup of triple, grande, mocha, non-fat, 3 packs of Equals and come back with tyes more bugged out than before.
<br />
<br />but dude.. the first time I played it I ran in to the friggin planet before I knew what ......</div>

<br />
<br />I have released portions of my mod and will continue to do so people can disect it and make it better and also to help create your own.  Maybe after several people struggle to create their own they might have an appreicate what I do.
<br />

<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Conan007:
<br />
<br />Currently the train mod is not implemented.  I am guessing around 1.7 for that.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />LonelyTower:
<br />
<br />Not sur you understand where the current shield regen is.  Here is what it is for 1.5a
<br />
<br />Player &amp; NPC: 333.333 shield regen = 5 minutes (100K / 333.333)
<br />Frieghters have 666.666 regen and 250K shields = 6.5 minutes (250K  666.666)
<br />
<br />In 1.6 I have just about gotten rid of NPC regen.  at 111.111 it takes about 15 minutes for them to regen.  I've also increased the damage of teh weapons.
<br />
<br />As far as starting at pittsberg, after the mission you get 50,000 credits so all you have to do is fly to manhattan.  I will change this though.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Digital:
<br />
<br />Thank you, I REALLY appreciate that.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Michael Dan:
<br />
<br />Please see the readme for 1.6
<br />
<br />As far as the mission were you have to destroy a station, yes by then you should have enough to buy a saber or a good freighter.  Try using the drone freighter they have ALOT of firepower.
<br />
<br />I am revamping the base and BS hit points.  Stations will always be a heck of alot harder to blow up.  I believe the shield gens have 15 mill HP each, I'm not sure atm.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />MadMax:
<br />
<br />Sorry I was not trying to rant against you.  I do not have any prbolem with you.
<br />
<br />I was just trying to get across a job like that is beyong my time constraights right now.
<br />
<br />I can take critism, but not an outright attack.  Big brother was not critism, it WAS an attack.
<br />
<br />As far as your comments about the reading the task manager, I am a hacker and proud to admit it.  There are many tools out there that allow you to do this.  Windows has so many exploits it is not funny.  FL itself gives you the ability to do this.  FL AUTOMATICALLY scans your task manager, I just changed it to suit my needs.
<br />
<br />As fas as working 60+ a week, believe what you want to believe.  I own my own company and it is a hell of alot of work to be self employeed.  If I don't work I don't make money.  Here is my business website.  <a href='http://www.thevirtualworlds.com' Target=_Blank> My business </a>, I am a web designer and maintain all the sites I create.  Not an easy task, plus I constantly have to find new business all the time.  I also have a family to take care of and a house to make payments for etc....
<br />
<br />Also think I am a kid if you want.  I have a temper and I see no reason to change it.  I was in the military as a green beret and an quiet proficient at dealing with someone.  I've was also in several of the past conflcits we had.  I've already been thrown in jail once because I got in a fight and my hands are weapons and will do it again if need be.
<br />
<br />So yes I am high strung and under a constant amount of large stress.  I can take critism, but not direct attacks.
<br />
<br />If you think I was talking to you as one of the complainers you are mistaken.  I ahve seen your support posts in the past and appreciate them.  There is a definate change between people who make suggestions, people who complain, and people who flame.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Andairus:
<br />
<br />I appreciate your suggestions but trying to explain why I did all this would take to much time.  I did it to help people and to create something different.  There are 4 BILLION people ou there and each with their own opinion.  I can only do so much.  Shield with BS are not really possible there is a huge bug with that.  People ahve done it, but they also suffer massive crashes.
<br />
<br />1.6 will be revamping alot of stuff.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Big Brother:
<br />
<br />I'm not going to get into a screaming match with you again.
<br />
<br />Concering 1.4 vs 1.5a, in 1.5a shield regen WAS changed, I forogt to put that in the readme, please notice this line in the 1.5a readme.
<br />
<br />Equipment Modifications
<br />
<br />Lv 1 Fighter Shield - 100K - <b>333.333 regen      </b>
<br />Lv 1 Freighter Shield - 250K - <b>666.666 regen      </b>
<br />Lv 1 Battleship Shield - 500K - <b>999.999 regen      </b>
<br />
<br />Also you complain about 4 second trusters?  You are still using the lv 1 thuster.  Try getting an order thruster or did you miss that part too in the readme...
<br />
<br />Lv 1 Thrusters - 10K HP - 500 Energy Usage - $1000
<br />Lv 2 Thrusters - 20K HP - 400 Energy Usage - $5000
<br />Lv 3 Thrusters - 30K HP - 300 Energy Usage - $10000
<br />Lv 4 Thrusters - 40K HP - 200 Energy Usage - $15000
<br />Order Thruster - 50K HP - 100 Energy Usage - $20000
<br />
<br />The HP and energy usage will also be reduced in 1.6
<br />
<br />You are right about the code part.  All I do is code most of the day in a basement, rarely see sunlight, and get close to the drink you described.  I don't have a choice. I do this or I don't make money.  
<br />
<br />Right now I am tempeted to take 9-5 job even ith the economy the way it they are SO MUCH easier!  Don't have to worry about getting work, don't have to worry about gettin paid, only about getting fired and you can always get another job.
<br />
<br />I just not going to care anymore and do my own thing.  I'm tired of trying to please everyone, thats impossible.   
<br />
<br />I am really tired of arguring with alot of you people.  FIRST you download the CORRPUPT version from the lancer site when I say download the RIGHT version from my server.  Then you exepct it to work perfect and to YOUR satisfaction, screw everyone else, it HAS to be right for YOU, and if one thing is wrong you come on here and flame the hell out of me for giving a crappy product.
<br />
<br />From now on I'm not going to deal with people who JUST whine and complain.  Don't like it, don't play it.  I value suggestions and CONSTRUCTIVE critism.  If you have a problem I will try and fix it, but don't come on here and say &quot;this mod sucks&quot; or &quot;it isn't working right!&quot;  Whos &quot;right&quot; should it work to, yours or mine?
