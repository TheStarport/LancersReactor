			<div class="content">I have got Freelancer working although some sound issues still bug me. However I have played a little bit now, just done the first mission. I have some suggestions:
<br />- easy to fix I imagine, but it appears that when you load a game you had saved in a bar, there are different people when you load the game from when you saved. The bar people are randomly generated I think, but it would add to immersion if the game could remember who was in the bar from your save.
<br />- Apparantly there are only 13 storyline missions??? This seems very, very short to me, considering the first two of them (at least) are offered to you immediately at the game start.
<br />- The above point would be less of an issue if there were other missions to do. I mean, like side quests, not just random missions. So maybe a series of 5 or so missions that have you working in a mini story. 
<br /> - Faction missions (again maybe these are in the game but I haven't read so). So you can join a specific faction and get their tech or ships.
<br /> - Galaxy is affected by your actions. So if you choose one way of doing things, you end up blowing up a planet or something, or wiping out a colony, or taking over a colony so it is under different rule.
<br />
<br />My favrouite game of this genre was Escape Velocity on the mac, that game was fantastic, it offered all that freelancer does but had loads of mini plots like I mentioned above, as well as main storyline missions (the main story you could side with one of two sides, as well). In EV, if you got powerful enough you could threaten a space station and they'd send out fighters, if you killed them all you would take over the space station and get tribute from them, as well as in effect starting your own faction... you could get bounty hunters chase after you... also in some story missions, planets'# colonies changed so a planet that once sold cerain goods with certain places to go, was overthrown and a new colony was put there. It was good to read about these events in the 'news' section and see your name as part of it.
<br />
<br />I don't know if these features can be added, I hope at least some of them can, hopefully not in an expansion pack (mainly because an expansion pack will take a long time to be released), I know MS has a lot of money so maybe they can fund it.....
<br />
<br />comments welcom.,

			<div class="content">In answer to the 13 missions, its true there are only 13 missions but the game continues after and you don't have to do all of the missions straight away. The point of having the factions and the trading is that you don't have to do the missions and you can just play the game.
<br />
<br />However I think you have a point that it would be nice to be able to do a mini story for a faction. Maybe to join them, maybe to increase your rating with them faster than doing single missions or just random pirating.
<br />
