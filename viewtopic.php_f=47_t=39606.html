<br /><b>Prologue               </b> - The light grew more intense. Something was wrong. &#8220;Bravo, it&#8217;s coming from the node, get out of there!&#8221; Viper called loudly, his voice on an edge now. The light now grew at a rapid pace. In a matter of seconds, it enveloped Bravo and his ship. Viper attempted to fire up his engines, but to no avail. The light moved faster than Viper realized. He and his craft were swallowed up in the intensity of it. It grew brighter and larger in area, until it was as large as a jump gate. It then began to cool, solidifying as it did; until it was the form of a triangular jump gate; an alien jump gate. Lights began to pulse at the corners, blue and deep. But then, no one remained to see it. The only thing that had escaped it, was a quick signal and picture Viper sent before he disappeared.
<br />
<br />Razor-1 was in the bar on the Cadiz base. He wanted something to wet his whistle. His edge was getting soft these days. He relished the honing of the edge he developed fighting the Nomads. It helped him to have a focus, and it helped him to survive. Now though, he needed to sharpen it again. After downing the drink, he headed over to the part&#8217;s dealer. He purchased ten EMP mines and had the dealer set them to his ship harmonics. The dealer was horrified, &#8220;They will hone in on you the moment they activate, your ship will be destroyed!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know what I&#8217;m doing, just set them up and store them on my ship&#8221; Razor said as he turned and walked away. After the loading and a final warning, he contacted launch control for departure clearance. Even as his ship slipped from the bay, the dealer was frantically contacting Tobias. 
<br />
<br />From the bar, all could see Razor as he moved in a tight circle just far enough away from the station that the mines could not home in on it. The EMP&#8217;s he carried, only had a blast radius of twenty meters. Anything outside that range would not be effected. On the third circle, Razor hit the release switch, until all ten were floating in space. The last one, still near enough to his ship, activated its homing beacon and began the move toward the ship. Razor hit the afterburner and sped away. Once out of the mines range, he turned the stick to put his ship in a one eighty and headed directly back at the mine.
<br />
<br />The base had cameras on the whole scene though some preferred to watch from view ports. As soon as he came in range of the first mine, it picked up speed, locking in on his ship and cycled in the detonation sequence. He locked his cannons and lasers on the mine and let loose a volley of fire that destroyed the mine less than a second before it would have detonated the EMP pulse and disabled his ship. A flash at the base, and many presumed he was now disabled and the remaining mines would destroy the ship. But a pulse of thrusters and another firing sequence and another exploding and they knew he was still there, and his skills were exceptional.  Hovis even had a wager going on as to wether Razor would get them all or not, too bad he would lose this bet.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>And Now, the Conclusion to our story . . .                </b>
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 1               </b>
<br />
<br />On Manhattan a high level meeting continued in the presidential palace. Many there were on alert. It had been many years since there were this many different capital ships in orbit of the planet. All the new governors of the different houses were there. This was a meeting for the survival of the Sirius sector and all those here. They first had to deal with thier differences and set them aside. If not, this new threat was the least of thier worries. 
<br />
<br />Video was being shown of the gate and its appearance to function. Unlike the one that the fleet had used to reach the nomad home area, this one was completely active and had a defense shield up. King had several ships fire low powered shots at it to test it. He didn&#8217;t want to risk damaging it nor reprisals on those firing at it. The shots reflected off it with ease and no damage was done. Beacons were set at five hundred meter ranges to warn all away from the area. The majority complied with the orders, except for one or two rebel pirates that thought credits could be made there. They ventured too close to it and its defensive program must have activated and the ships simply disappeared from sight. No explosions, no jump gate functions that they knew of, they simply vanished.
<br />
<br />This prompted even a faster response from King and Orillion for a build up of the fleet. Now though, they had help. The Kusari navy had offered half its fleet to the order and sent them to a location that Orillion signaled as a staging area. It was his judgement that until more was known, they did not want to provoke a military response from whoever set up the jump gate. 
<br />
<br />Juni was a little under the weather the past five days and was late arriving at the meeting. Trent noticed it and led her aside to find out if all was ok. &#8220;Juni, you look terrible, what&#8217;s wrong&#8221; he asked concerned. 
<br />
<br />She gave him a smirk back and said &#8220;Thanks a lot, Trent, you would look wonderful to, if you were in my situation.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t know what to make of her response, but the president was motioning for them to move back to the meeting and he had to put off any more questions till later. Orillion had a display of all available ships and thier staging areas. They were all within one day&#8217;s jump of the target, but would not provoke a response, he hoped. Two new people to the meeting, who were also nonmilitary were Mr. Blix and Mr. Jonner. They had come at Trent&#8217;s bidding and to offer any outside feedback that could be had. It proved to be worthwhile. Between the two of them, they had, premonitions if you will, that the Dom Kavash were back and would soon arrive in this area, but for peaceful purposes. 
<br />
<br />Sinclair chose this moment to voice her concern as well. She had been doing deep research on the artifacts that led her to believe that the Dom Kavash were a race that lived for one thousand years, then hibernated for another thousand and began the cycle again. They, by the artifacts were powerful due to the technology, but may not have been a race of warriors. It was her opinion that they were awakening, and that humanity&#8217;s posture should be one of friendship, not fear.
<br />
<br />On Leeds, Tobias and Quintain were discussing the matter of getting Bretonia to commit more than a token fleet to the matter. But they had little success convincing the Prime Minister of the reality of the threat. They just shook thier heads and headed to the docking area to Quintain&#8217;s ship. They still had a couple of leads to follow up to gather pilots for the cause.
<br />
<br />A month has passed with many things worked out and a growing fleet. The Osiris and two escorts headed for the jump gate. There had been an increase in the energy output from the gate. Casper was taking a relaxed posture at the moment and kept the ships in casual formation. They did not want to look like an attack formation to whoever would appear from the gate. 
<br />
<br />Light began to form, the swirl of energy like a vortex within the center of the triangle. And slowly a massive ship appeared. It was alone and no fighter craft appeared from it. King was on it the moment it appeared and began to transmit friendship messages in all know languages and in various codes that were known. This had to work, or they would be at war and in the midst of the fire.
<br />
<br />The form of the ship was so alien. Nothing like they could have ever imagined or even like the Nomads. It was long was the only common feature. It had no view ports or apparent bridge section, but it did have hundreds of flashing nodes all up and down the hull. There was also no engine output either, yet it traveled on. Its drive had to be something so different that they did not need traditional designs. It was a thing of beauty to Trent. 
<br />
<br />The ship continued on a course that brought it parallel to the Osiris and it decelerated. A hatch began to slide open, giving view to a small craft bay. What looked like a five or a six-man shuttle lifted off the ship&#8217;s deck and moved out into the cold, airless confines of space. It too moved with the grace and beauty of the larger ship. Casper gave orders for the hanger bay to be opened for the incoming ship.
<br />
<br />The Aliens seemed to know what was expected of them and they moved into position to dock with the smaller Osiris. The colors of the smaller craft, now seen in the landing lights, seemed to shimmer, first green, then blue then black. Never the same on the whole area. As if it were alive almost. As it passed through the force fields, the color solidified to a deep rich blue. As the bay doors closed under the craft, it extended landing pads to settle down on the deck. 
<br />
<br />In an adjoining area, Casper, Lord Hakkera, Juni, Trent and former president Jacobi as representatives to meet the new arrivals, waited nervously. This was a delicate situation, that if handled wrong, would bring about disaster. Seconds ticked by as they waited, then movement was seen on the view screen. A hatch opened, slowly at first. The beings, since they were not to be thought of as aliens any more, exited the craft. They were bi-pedal and almost humanoid in form.
<br />
<br />They appeared to be dressed in shimmering robes and thier heights were about seven feet tall. There was an air of regalness about them. The grace in there walk toward the members there to greet them was profound. King touched the button that opened the door to the beings and gestured for them to enter. Thier steps were even light. Lord Hakkera led the way to the large banquet room just down the hall. It was lavishly prepared with many delicacies from many worlds.
<br />
<br />For the moment, introductions began. All the human ones introduced themselves and then waited, in hopes they would be understood. The first one began, in standard language at that. &#8220;You may call me Alpha, as my name is not pronounceable in your language.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;And You may call me, Beta&#8221; spoke the other, in a decidedly feminine voice. This one also extended a hand and opened it to reveal a small gem display that gave the appearance of a solar system engraved in it. &#8220;This is a gift from our people to your people&#8221; Beta spoke. Jacobi accepted the gift and offered her thanks on behalf of the peoples of Sirius sector.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We have taken the liberty of setting a meal for you&#8221; Lord Hakkera spoke, &#8220;I hope there is something in which you can partake in&#8221; he asked questioningly. He indicated the food set on the large table. The two beings, alpha and Beta, served the foods and appeared to scan them. In less than a minuet, the replied, &#8220;Thank you very much, this food is similar to that which we prepare for ourselves.&#8221;

			<div class="content">The meal went quite well, which was a relief to Jacobi. This first contact went well. It was, she hoped to be the beginning of a strong welcoming on both cultures side. After the meal was over, there began some detailed discussion by both sides in regards to peace. It was brought up about the war with the Nomads. The Kavash race, as they chose to be called, apologized for the war, explaining that the Nomads had done what they did to protect them while they were vulnerable. It was unfortunate that they activated on finding the artifacts though. Casper expressed is reservation about the protectors and wether they would be used again. I was then explained that they would not, until the thousand years was up and they hibernated again. But by that time, it would be hopped that the Sirius sector would be counted as friend, and not just as another inhabitant of the area.
<br />
<br />Talks went on for nearly a week with many issues being addressed and then settled. In the end, it was agreed to allow groups of &#8220;listened&#8221; explores free travel through the Kavash stargates. Others could be allowed limited travel to trade, work and enjoy new areas, but that any hostilities could terminate this and any other offers that arise.
<br />
<br />Trent and King proposed a police force of joint complement to patrol the areas and watch for any who may have problems with the new arrangements. It would be over seen by both governments and hand selected to weed out any problems.
<br />
<br />On the battleship Hood, another meeting was taking place. One that was so secretive, few knew of it and those attending it. The leader stood and walked toward the view prot. No racing was held today, but he was still making bets. &#8220;Can you gather up support for us, but using discretion so that no one knows what we are doing?&#8221; He asked a seated patron the man with a scare across his face and skills to fly like a predator looked back at the walking man, &#8220;I know of a few willing to follow us and &#8216;think&#8217; as we do.&#8221; The voice replied. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, contact them then and have them report here for a &#8216;race&#8217; if you know what I mean&#8221; the man spoke softly and walked back to the view port. His thoughts were troubled. The turn of events had left him with a bitter taste in his mouth. He had been asked to prepare for war and was then put on the shelf like an unused plan. He did not take kindly to that. He would make sure this &#8216;Peace&#8217; did not last very long, then they would welcome his help again. 
<br />
<br />The man with the scar went to his quarters on the Hood and began to open communications with some associates he knew. Razor one would have his fight as well, and soon. He too like the other man, did not like being used only for an emergency and then cast away when it wasn&#8217;t suitable anymore.
<br />
<br />The man stood so long at the window, that the bartender had to alert him when he was closing down. &#8220;Go ahead, I think I&#8217;ll stay here awhile longer, Mike.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;In that case, see you in the morning, Hovis.&#8221; Mike replied and left. He turned down the lighting a little and locked up. He needed to get to his runabout and head home, but first, he needed to make a call.
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 2          </b>
<br />
<br />Nearly a month after the meeting with th Kavash, Trent was back at the blood dragons base to pick up Juni. She had been away for most of the time, looking for those that would make goo officers of the new police force. She still had not told Trent the &#8216;Good&#8217; news, but he would find out sooner or later. But she decided now was the time, while thing were quiet. 
<br />
<br />After setting down and securing things Trent climbed out of his craft. He had just come back from looking into a new ship design. It was one that would be used exclusively for the new force. He wanted to rest up and spend some long over due time with Juni. He never did get to find out what was wrong with her at the meeting and they were split up shortly afterwards. 
<br />
<br />His boot had hardly touched the deck plate when Juni leapt into his arms. It seemed she had missed him just as much as he did her. After a long welcoming kiss, they headed for thier quarters with Juni having one of those sly grins on her face. This got Trent&#8217;s attention, though he decided to wait till they had privacy to ask what was up.
<br />
<br />After the usual meal and a nap, Trent found his wife in the kitchen washing dishes. He came up behind her and held her in his arms. &#8220;Ok, now tell me what&#8217;s up&#8221; he asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you mean, what&#8217;s up, what would give you that idea?&#8221; She asked, a grin again on her face.
<br />
<br />He told her he always knew when something was up by the grin she would have on. She led him by the hand to the sofa and they sat. &#8220;Well, remember when I wasn&#8217;t feeling good at the meeting and said you would feel the same if you were in my situation?&#8221; Trent nodded, he knew she was ok or she would have said so.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, it seems that things have multiplied for us a bit&#8221; she spoke softly, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a baby.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent was ecstatic. He had hopped to be a father one day, though now was as good a time as any. He held her in his arms as the precious gift she was. Juni knew thier love for each other had grown in leaps and bounds, but now it had another to share it with.
<br />
<br />An hour latter, Trent went out for a walk without telling Juni. She saw him head out the door without saying anything and knew something was up. She followed a few minutes latter and found him sitting on the edge of the landing platform. He looked upset. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Remember, we promised to share everything, good or bad&#8221; she spoke carefully. She wanted to know what was wrong. He looked up at her with a sad look, like he had just lost a friend.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I have to leave in an hour&#8221; he said. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s happened that you have to leave now, we have a week off together to relax, Orillion gave us the time off himself&#8221; she whispered.
<br />
<br />He held her and looked into her eyes, &#8220;Seems one of our former colleagues has decided to become a stumbling block&#8221; Trent replied. &#8220;And now, we have to act on it to preserve the new alliance. It seems Hovis has changed his mind on supporting us, he would rather go to war to try and defeat the Kavash rather than have peace with them. He&#8217;s got company as well, Razor-one is his main support too.

			<div class="content">Hovis and Razor-one headed back to the Hood. They had the promise of three cruisers form Rhineland and the possibility of a battleship. Now they needed fighter support to protect the new fleet in order to get it in position to take on the aliens and thier fleet. They refused to believer the lies these creatures have been feeding everyone. &#8216;Everybody knows the nomads about did us in, now the makers of the nomads are back. What&#8217;s to stop them from finishing us off.&#8217; This misinformation was about to cause serious repercussions for everyone. 
<br />
<br />As Hovis climbed out of his ship, a cloaked figure move closer to him. Hovis reacted by signaling for them to move into the shadows to talk. This was the information he hoped for. The cloaked person was a member of Liberty Security Force and could not risk being identified. This insider provided data of fleet movements and manpower layout of key bases. It was al important to put this peace alliance out of commission. 
<br />
<br />Alpha and Beta both returned to their ship. They had much to discuss among themselves and more to inform thier leaders of. Peace could truly be had, if discretion were used. They took thier observations back to those above them. They too saw war as pointless destruction of lives, on both sides. These humans had after all, defeated thier protection and could be a threat if not handled properly. Peace truly did seem to be the best alterative, but it would also require the humans to keep thier people in line, or all would be jeopardized and war would begin. It was a fine line to walk indeed.
<br />
<br />The ship moved away from the new outpost. It had been built near the new jump gate to the Kavash territory. This, it seemed, was the edge of thier worlds. They took this position as emissary because they thought that peace was a better alternative to destruction. They might could win the war, but at what cost to thier civilization. How much would be lost and the cost of the vast libraries they had. The knowledge they had obtained was irreplaceable.
<br />
<br />Juni was doing better these days. She had adapted to a less vigorous routine. She had another life to consider now. Trent though, was still being tapped to carry on as usual. He was still trying to find more of what Hovis and his people were up to. They had just discovered that the LSF had a mole and King wanted him badly. Casper put some of the Order on it and sent them under cover to sniff out this rat before too much damage could be done. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Juni, I have to head to Kusari space to meet with Lord Hakkera and see if we can move that part of the fleet at random to keep the rebellion from finding more information out.&#8221; Strange to consider part of your own people as a rebellion. Juni could only nod. She didn&#8217;t like it, but knew Trent was right. Sinclar would be stopping by later to check on her any way. Maybe the two of them could get something started as well.
<br />
<br />She missed flying about on missions, but knew she had to be more careful. The doctor just yesterday told her to slow down, that she was putting the baby at risk. For now, she agreed with him, but she promised jokingly, that Trent would be doing some baby sitting while she ran some missions. The Doctor just shook his head as he packed his bag up and left. He never understood these military types. 
<br />
<br />Trent just reached the landing platform when a man stepped from hiding. He was an informant that Trent had hired. Seemed like there were too many these days on both sides. This one though was paid to follow razor and report on his whereabouts. Trent wanted badly to talk to him away from Hovis. He thought he might be able to convince him to come back on this side of the fence and still use his skills.

			<h3><a href="#p373166" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Not all that original. The subject of every other bloody fanfic is the return of the Nomads, Coalition, or Dom Kavash. Another bloody variation on the theme.
<br />
<br />Fanfic writers should try to get outside the box of &quot;Alien Invaders&quot;. Regardless of whether the invaders are the evil communist Russians, Dom Kavash/nomads, a combination, or such aliens unrelated to freelancer as those in Halo, the stories end up all the same: dry, glib, dreary. 
<br />
<br />Plus: the Trent/Juni relationship. Once again, unoriginal. And unrealistic. Juni is not portrayed as the wife and mother type in the game. Nor does Trent seem the kind who would want to have a child. Maybe they are. Who knows? But then its your job as author to show the audience that. Which you haven't.
<br />
<br />And its also dull. Really, really dull. Very little dialogue or character development. What dialogue there is is cliched and unrealistic:
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>She gave him a smirk back and said &#8220;Thanks a lot, Trent, you would look wonderful to, if you were in my situation.&#8221; <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Ignoring the grammatical and spelling errors (sue me, I'm a stickler), this piece of dialogue makes no sense. In essence, its a ploy to suggest that there is a deeper situation that is affecting Juni, right? So put yourself in her situation. Would <i>you </i> say something like that? Or instead, look away and mutter &quot;It's nothing&quot;? The dialogue in and of itself just seems completely out of place. One can't believe that Juni would say those words in that situation. And you, as author, without further dialogue have given the readers no reason to believe she would say that. 
<br />
<br />As for suggestions...
<br />
<br />You're listing actions that have happened. Instead of that, try going into detail about what's going on. Give Trent and Juni a couple of &quot;soliloquy&quot; scenes, portray their thoughts and conflicts to the audience. Make them more than two-dimensional  words. Do the same for Hovis.
<br />
<br />Make it interesting. Give the narrative some depth, some interesting qualities... 
<br />
<br />If nothing else, make it realistic.</div>

			<div class="content">Sorry you didn't like the story, Wilde. It the second half of one I wrote over a year ago. As to a relationshiop with Juni and Trent, it was my choice and I stand by it. Also, I do not like a lot of dialoge in my stories, it takes away from what is going one around people. This is after all, a possible future story of the freelancer universe. This is meant as a drama story, not a battle  one. It was meant to take a turn from what the first half did. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Not at all. 
<br />
<br />But if its a drama fanfic, make it dramatic. Make it invoke feeling and emotion!
<br />
<br />You, as author, have to make the relationship believable. Otherwise its flimsy, unrealistic, uncaptivating. It has to be complex to be believable, furthermore. No relationship is based on just love and involves just love--and if it does, then the relationship will probably be such a major part of one's life, diminshing in one's perspective the relevance and importance of everything else, that it will engulf one's life. More often than not, with disastrous consequences.
<br />
<br />You don't like a lot of dialogue in your stories...well, fine, but it's still dull as hell. Your characters have therefore no way to expand and become more than one dimensional; the narrative lists a series of actions only, and there is no dialogue. If you also don't like three-dimensional characters in your stories, fine by me. Continue listing on events in a tone that would dwarf the Enuma Elish in tedium.
<br />
<br />Frankly, also, the first part is much better. The first-person narrative from Trent especially at the beginning allows one as reader to get inside his psyche, understand truly his need for Juni. <i>That </i> is interesting and realistic.

			<div class="content">Hi Wilde,
<br />It's hard being completely original. Most themes are widely used.
<br />
<br />Is there a theme that hasn't been covered extensively here on these boards? I agree dialogue makes a story better from so many angles..
<br />
<br />Final, I thought the SW stories you wrote were great. They had plenty of dialogue, action and a rich background. Couldn't you transfer some of that to this story?

			<div class="content">Hey athena, I could to a degree. I hope this one is more drama, though there are some action/fighting parts coming up including interaction between Juni and some antaganistic types. It will pick up a little, but I also hoped to bring the aliens to a human relating aspect. The end will prove differnt than most expect to happen. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Athena--true, so then could we agree that true brillinace comes from those who play on the themes well? Your fanfic did.
<br />
<br />This failed with flying colours.
<br />
<br />Whatever you may say about originality, this story is still <i>dull </i>. Dull, and one dimensional.
<br />
<br />It wouldn't lose the spirit of the game at all! This is the plague of Fan Fiction on this site, thinking that the only possible sequel to Freelancer has to revolve around another alien invasion as opposed to exploring new possibilities, revitalizing the story, and not producing story after story of endless drivel on the same subject.
<br />
<br />Once again, Finalday, if it's drama why is there no dialogue? Just narrative recounting action after action, not delving into the characters at all! For <i>character </i> and archetype are the root of drama, and <i>situation </i> is the root of all action.</div>
