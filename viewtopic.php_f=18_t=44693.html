			<div class="content">Just an idea I have right now, but I was thinking about creating a mod that would basically strip out a lot of the content that rarely gets used ...
<br />
<br />This could be as simple as removing systems that rarely get used/avoided, removing weapons and equipment that hardly get used, and maybe adding some features that weren't in the original Freelancer, like the ability to buy battleships and gunboats, ability to buy armour and shield enhancers etc.
<br />
<br />Also cutting down on the AI encounters, limiting to encounters nearby tradelane junctions and house planets or select bases would be good, in diminished numbers.
<br />
<br />Consolidating some of the key elements nearer together, for example strategic positions, having jumpgates to the major systems, completing a few of the omicron systems that weren't there, putting Freeport 7 back in there.
<br />
<br />A whole bunch of ideas really.
<br />
<br />The aim would be to cut down on some travel time, provide some more strategic positions for clans and such to hold, take over etc, removing NPC encounters in un-needed places to allow for lightened server load and PVP'ing without lag or screen stutter from NPCs or being killed by them.
<br />
<br />Has anyone worked on something like this at all?
<br />
<br />I mean 48 systems, that can take hours to even scratch the surface of, and not a lot of Freelancer players even have that time to sit down and play.
<br />
<br />For those who want to be able to come and play, roleplay, fight with other players and have access to more of freelancers non-player equipment or ships, and not take half an hour to get to a place to fight some people who just logged on, would maybe attract some players.
<br />
<br />Whaddya think?
<br />
<br />Kinda like vanilla, but with a couple of interesting twists and attractions.
<br />
<br />I aim to revamp some of the major systems, like new york, new berlin etc to maybe consolidate and change a few things.
<br />
<br />Revamping of some textures too maybe ...
<br />
<br />The whole point of this would be to provide a new experience but still remain quite faithful to the original experience.
<br />
<br />Obviously the first step is to plan and remove items that are rarely used or visited and so some of you veterans would be able to tell me here what aspects and systems you find boring/dont hang around in or just use to get to somewhere else and maybe we can find a good way to cut these things out.
<br />
<br />I already have a story in mind that would allow a move to a different galaxy following the nomad war, with the colonies being so spread out and divided the nomads nearly succeeded in destroying all they had built, and so they move to a different galaxy, with a governing covenant Europa to unite the houses and keep them within reach at all times.
<br />
<br />The edges of the new galaxy would contain the criminals, pirates, rogues etc, away from civilised space, although thats where the better trade routes would be and the more dangerous.  There may even be a sol system in there, who knows...
<br />
<br />Point is I might need help ... but primarily this thread is to gauge the communities reactions and thoughts.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p412828" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Actually i was going to do a project under the same name, but a slightly different purpose. My idea was to take freelancer and rip out everything that you could, taking out the storyline, taking out all references to all systems except Li01, destroying all the bases and every object in li01 except manhatten,ripping out almost all weapons, almost all ships, almost all voices, almost all rooms, practically destroying everything that isn't required by freelancer to run without crashing. In theory, if you used the openSP v1.1 hacked DLL by Xerx, you could rip out a _LOT_ of stuff. Ideally the only thing that would exist would be placeholder resource files, a single ship, a single weapon, a single engine, a single system, a single base, a single room, a single starsphere, and thats it.
<br />
<br />I tried to do it, and got pretty far but gave up because of lack of time. What i did was actually disable the loading of the single player DLL file altogether. While this would normally just spawn you in the FP7 system, i managed to substitute that system for the Li01 system. I can't quite remember how, either i switched a reference, or i substituted Li01's system data in for FP7's. I also ripped out  a lot of other stuff. Its definatly possible, it just needs to be done by someone with enough time.</div>

			<div class="content">Caught your answer in the other thread ...
<br />
<br />One of my original plans was to create a mini-sdk with exactly that, 1 of everything, with everything else in the game, weapons etc as scripts, so people would simply be able to pick and choose items by dropping the individual scripts in there.
<br />
<br />But I lack that understanding unfortunately :/
<br />
<br />What I could really do with at the moment is some sort of graph or heirarchy display detailing how each file relates to eachother recursively and what they refer to
<br />
<br />for example listing how shiparch (what it is and contains) related to loadouts.ini and so on and so forth.
<br />
<br />What I am trying to do now is gather an effective means for the links between SP and MP to be severed so that MP would still work, but SP doesn't so that if I was to remove a system like NY, it wouldn't cause crashes say for example in flserver.exe when you start it up.
<br />
<br />If we can get all our heads together and bash this thing in the head it would be great!
<br />
<br />Firstly though, a few years back now there was an idea for a Hyperspace system, I'm going to try my hand at that for the moment <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />But I would love to create some subspace like effects, as seen on stargate sg-1/atlantis when the hyperdrive vessels are travelling through subspace, the blue sort of tunnel effect would be great.
<br />
<br />Anyone good at starspheres?  Cos that one I believe is one of the Uknowns has a tunnel like effect in its starsphere if I remember correctly...</div>

			<div class="content">Very Wrong. While every tunnel *looks* the same, the creators of the game originally had planned seperate colors for each house. You can experiment for yourself by putting in &quot;wormhole_liberty&quot; as a value instead of &quot;wormhole_bretonia&quot; (or whatever the actual values are, i don't know off the top of my head).
<br />
<br />In addition, if you'll look at the Free Worlds mod, they went as far as to edit the .txm file to the warp tunnel. So you can change its appearence to whatever you like, in the ranges of sanity, at least. No planets or anything, of course, you can only change the texture of the tunnel itself, along with several other properties. I myself have managed to get some rather interesting warp effects.
<br />
<br />As for the technical know-how, i can show you how to rip out the storyline and the systems, but thats rudimentary compared to the knowledge needed to rip out the other things.
<br />
<br />Storyline: Go into Freelancer.ini, and find the reference to the DLL that is described as the storyline DLL, and comment it out. Voila, SP is utterly and completely broken. If you want it to work properly, there are several options but i won't detail them here. EDIT: scratch this, see my Rip SP v0.5 thread.
<br />
<br />StarSpheres: These are just model files, you can view them in HardCMP.
