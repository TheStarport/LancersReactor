<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter Thirteen- Revolutions </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />Over the next week, Black took a leading role in the Rheinland revolution.  
<br />
<br />Through Heinz&#8217;s skilled leadership and Black&#8217;s shrewd tactics, the revolutionaries managed to secretly take control of Stuttgart, Frankfurt, and Hamburg.  After only a week, they had amassed a fleet of over two hundred fighters of varying type, and a few capital ships that had survived the initial takeover.  They had nearly the whole of free Rheinland supporting them, and they had a name: The Rheinland Liberation Army, or the RLA.  
<br />
<br />They had engaged in many hit and run attacks on Bretonian forces, and their network of spies knew the location of every Bretonian capital ship that was in Rheinland space at any given time. The RLA had successfully taken back the three systems and all bases and planets within them by simply using coordinated surprise attacks to destroy all the Bretonian ships in the system and then let the Rheinland people depose the Bretonian governors.
<br />
<br />Now, it was time to attack New Berlin.  As of yet, the RLA forces had managed to keep the Bretonian fleet bottled up in the system, because their spies had managed to plant rumors that there were giant fleets guarding the jumpgates, rather than a few squadrons of fighters.  The Bretonians were suspicious, but not suspicious enough to do anything yet.  
<br />
<br />Black had told Heinz that he thought it was time to make the final attack, and Heinz concurred.  They set it up that the attack group would be divided into three groups, one attacking from each RLA system.  They would push through, destroying Bretonian ships at all the bases they passed, and then they would meet at Planet New Berlin, and make their final assault on the planet and the Ring installation.  The planet was expected to fall fairly easily, as the Bretonians had never taken control of the surface, because roaming mobs had already crushed the government in their desperate attempts to survive after the stock market crashed.  The entire Rheinland economy had died when the Bretonians took over the outlying Rheinland systems, since they were the source of most of Rheinland&#8217;s income.  The house had collapsed onto itself and the Chancellor and his associates were slaughtered when the mobs stormed the capitol building.  
<br />
<br />That was why the Ring installation, including the Oder Shipyards, were the RLA&#8217;s primary objectives in this attack.  The Bretonian occupation force had made the Ring their headquarters, and most of the Bretonian leadership was stationed there.  Heinz had managed to organize the remains of the Rheinland soldiers and was planning to use them as a landing force to quickly seize the installation and kill the Bretonian leadership.  
<br />
<br />So, the RLA leaders held a meeting and assigned ships and attack teams.  Shockingly, Black was the highest-ranking fleet officer in the RLA, and he was given command of the only battleship that the RLA possessed: the Westfalen.
<br />He was given control of Attack Group 2, the support group.  He was to enter from Hamburg with 75 fighters and three gunboats, and go straight to the Ring.  Heinz would then arrive with the attack craft, which were modified transports, and land on the Ring.  They would attack, and Black was simply supposed to hold off, and destroy if possible, the Bretonian defenders.  
<br />Black knew, based on previous experience, that the Bretonians would keep him very busy.  
<br />
<br />*******************************************
<br />
<br />Torpedoes hit the hull of the Westfalen.  Black requested a damage report. 
<br />&#8220;Three torpedoes hit the main fuel line.  Minor hull damage.  We&#8217;ve switched to the auxiliary line,&#8221; his aide stated, so nonchalantly that Black wouldn&#8217;t have been able to guess that they were in the middle of a huge battle just by listening to his voice.  
<br />
<br />Saying that they were in the middle of a huge battle didn&#8217;t even describe it.  The future of a nation depended on their victory, and the odds were firmly against them.  The Westfalen alone was dealing with three Bretonian battleships and dozens of fighters.  However, Black had been pleasantly surprised at the ship&#8217;s durability, for it had held up against punishment that would have left a Liberty Dreadnought in pieces.  
<br />
<br />Black activated the comm channel that would enable him to talk to his two surviving gunboat escorts.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Boys, we&#8217;re running the gauntlet,&#8221; he told them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Running the gauntlet&#8221; was a tactic that had been created years ago by a well-known Liberty admiral named Michael Cloudwalker.  It was a tactic created for capital ship combat while outnumbered at least two-to-one.  
<br />
<br />The two gunboats formed up on the Westfalen&#8217;s left and right, and the three ships accelerated towards a gap between two of the three Bretonian battleships attacking them.  
<br />
<br />The idea behind the tactic was to slip right between two enemy capital ships.  Usually, the enemy would stop firing or fire less because of the high risk of missing and hitting the ship on the other side.  It was a risk that few captains would take, so for a few seconds, usually the ship in between would have free reign to fire at close range without being fired on.
<br />
<br />The three ships passed through the gauntlet and sure enough, the Bretonians didn&#8217;t fire.  All three of them opened up with everything they had on the Bretonians, and after they passed through, the Bretonian ships were being torn apart by internal explosions.  Only one was left.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Admiral, this is Heinz.  A Bretonian battleship has approached the station and is firing on my attack ships!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Black executed a hundred-eighty degree turn and brought the Westfalen towards the last Bretonian battleship.  It was deep within the swarm of Bretonian and RLA fighters that surrounded the Ring.  Its batteries were firing on the attack ships going in and out of the installation, ferrying the wounded and prisoners out of harm&#8217;s way and bringing in fresh men.  
<br />
<br />Black got within range and fired.  Instantly, a squadron of Bretonian fighters attacked him, launching more torpedoes into the Westfalen.  The ship held together, and Black fired again.  More torpedoes hit, this time near the engines.  
<br />&#8220;Sir!  We&#8217;ve lost life support and power to the stern compartments!&#8221; the aide exclaimed, this time showing emotion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Try to patch some power into there,&#8221; Black replied.  
<br />The Westfalen fired again.  The Bretonian battleship burst into flame and was torn into three pieces.  
<br />
<br />Then, a huge thump.  Alarms went on everywhere.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Status report!&#8221; Black screamed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;They fired an EMP torpedo up our engine shaft!&#8221; the aide was distressed now.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost the engine!  We&#8217;re drifting.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Remain clam.  Fire the emergency thrusters and get us stopped.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Another thump, this time softer.  The emergency thrusters had activated.  The 
<br />ship stopped, barely in time to not collide with the station.  
<br />Black sighed.  Another close shave.</div>

<br />
<br /><b>Chapter Fourteen- The Odds Against Us  </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />When they returned home to New York, accompanied by a squadron of the RLA&#8217;s finest, they were received as heroes by the Navy.  But even with the acts of Black, Fox, and Reeves, the situation still looked bleak.  Liberty had managed to recapture Texas, but there was a Bretonian fleet in California and a Kusari one in Colorado.  What was left of the Liberty military had gathered in New York, to prepare to defend their home.  The loss of Rheinland would only delay the enemy a few weeks at best.
<br />
<br />Black and Serena were now in conference with the leaders of Liberty.  President Wells was there, along with High Admiral Stephens, the collective head of Liberty&#8217;s military, in addition to Fleet Admirals Johnson and Lewis, plus several other Vice Admirals, Rear Admirals, and Commodores, including Commodore James Fox.  The topic was a grim one: the planning for the defense of New York.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is what I propose,&#8221; High Admiral Stephens said, &#8220;we divide the fleet into two parts.  One will be under Admiral Johnson, stationed at West Point to ward off attacks from California, and one will be under Admiral Lewis, stationed at For Bush to ward off attacks from Colorado.  Admiral Johnson will have his own Third Fleet, in addition to Battlegroups Four and Seven.  Lewis will have Fourth Fleet, along with Battlegroup Two.  The other active battlegroup: Battlegroup Five, will remain at Manhattan as a reserve force.  Does everyone agree?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Heads nodded around the room.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good.  Admiral Lewis and Admiral Johnson, you may brief your subordinates when you wish.  Thank you, everyone.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Black turned to leave, as he no longer commanded anything but the Jefferson.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Rear Admiral Black!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Black turned, to find Admiral Johnson coming after him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, sir?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I forgot to tell you.  The admiral in command of Battlegroup Seven has been promoted to fill a spot on my personal staff.  So I need a Vice Admiral who I can trust to lead the unit in the coming battle.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But why&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;And I&#8217;m choosing you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But I&#8217;m not a Vice&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You are now.  Congrats, son.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Johnson handed him the rank badge.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;All the frills will come after the battle.  For now, you need to report to West Point to get organized.  The Jefferson will be your flagship.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />When Black arrived at West Point with the Jefferson, (which had indeed safely escaped Dresden in time) he found a large force waiting for him there.  Three battleships, the Hawkeye, the Ranger, and the Maine, along with Black&#8217;s own Jefferson made up the core of the unit.  Then there were a pair of destroyers, ten cruisers, and ten full squadrons of fighters.  Their unit was meshed together with many other capital ships, which Black considered a testament to Liberty&#8217;s determination to survive.  With only Texas and New York to draw on for resources, Liberty&#8217;s shipbuilders at Norfolk, Juneau, and Baltimore had managed to build a record number of capital ships, with crews working around the clock to complete them.  Perhaps they might win after all.
<br />
<br />It was at this moment that the first Bretonian ships showed up on the Jefferson&#8217;s scanner.  
<br />
<br />The screen before him popped to life with an image of Admiral Johnson, then broke into smaller pieces as all the other commanders appeared as well.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;All units, prepare for immediate action,&#8221; Johnson said, only a hint of fear reaching his voice.
<br />
<br />On one of the screens on his chair, Black got a feed from the captains of his battlegroup.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;To battle stations.  Launch all fighters.  Raise shields.  Prepare to fire.&#8221;  Each order came out with a snap.  &#8220;I want fighters screening in the front, with cruisers behind them, and battleships in the rear.  Cruisers use your main guns to concentrate fire on their capital ships, but use your secondaries and flaks to fight off their fighters.  Battleships, concentrate only on capital ships.  Let&#8217;s go, people!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Black knew he sounded far more confident than he felt.  The enemy fleet was enormous: easily three times larger than the Liberty one.  
<br />
<br />A swarm of fighters swooped in on his battlegroup.  His cruisers fired, but there were just too many.  His fighters entered the fray, but they were picked apart as well.  Then, the enemy capital ships got into range.  His capital ships fired, and managed to pick two off, but then the Bretonians fired, and a wave of fire washed over his fleet.  The Ranger lost shields, then took serious damage.  It spun out of formation, awash with fire because of the oxygen it was venting.  Escape pods shot away, but not many.  A few Bretonian fighters closed to torpedo range and pumped Starkiller torpedoes into her.  The ship&#8217;s reactor finally gave in, and the ship vanished in a flash of blinding light.  
<br />
<br />The enemy capital ships fired again, and two cruisers vanished behind the wall of energy.  A destroyer was taken down by more fighters, and the Jefferson&#8217;s shields went down to 25%.  The Liberty answer was getting smaller each time, but a pair of Bretonian battleships dropped out of formation.  
<br />
<br />Black had had enough.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Battlegroup, move to this location at best speed.&#8221;  He tapped a location on his map screen, and a purple waypoint appeared on the map.  It would run them on a perpendicular course to the enemy, towards Manhattan.  Black hoped to be able to flank the enemy.  
<br />
<br />The Jefferson slowly turned, and the other survivors turned as well.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Keep up full broadside firepower on the enemy,&#8221; Black told his captains.  As he spoke, another cruiser winked off his display.  
<br />
<br />The Jefferson completed its turn, and the engines slowly started.  A ship pulled in close, and he recognized it as the Maine, the new command of Captain Serena Fox.  The ship was constantly firing at the enemy, regardless of what it was doing to its reactor.  Black sighed.  Serena enjoyed taking risks as a commander.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Commodore Fox, increase our speed to 150%.  Increase our firing rate as well.  Lower shield regen rate to 50%.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Fox raised an eyebrow at the order, but didn&#8217;t delay in obeying in the slightest.  
<br />
<br />The Jefferson resumed fire with renewed vigor, and between her and the Maine, another Bretonian capital ship was destroyed.  But there were just too many.  The Hawkeye&#8217;s captain reported damage, and then the ship began to slow.  The weakened ship quickly became the target of the Bretonians, who finished her off with ease.  
<br />
<br />Admiral Johnson came on the comm again.  &#8220;Call for reinforcement!  Damnit, get these fighters off..&#8221;  He was silenced abruptly, and Black saw through the view port the Freedom, Johnson&#8217;s flagship, vanish in a fiery hell.  Black hung his head at the loss of the man he so deeply respected.  
<br />
<br />With Johnson&#8217;s death, the Liberty fleet&#8217;s back was broken.  Units began to retreat, falling back towards the station.  The Bretonians took the initiative, swarming forward to smash the reeling Liberty force.  Black&#8217;s force was overrun by the enemy.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Battlegroup Seven, go to full emergency power!  Engines to 200%!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Jefferson and Maine lept forward, while the other ships struggled to keep up.  The few surviving fighters weaved around the ships, dancing the dance of death with the superior Bretonians.  
<br />
<br />At that point, one of Black&#8217;s aides announced, &#8220;Sir, we&#8217;re receiving a general transmission from Manhattan!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Put it on my screen.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The image of High Admiral Stephens appeared.  &#8220;All units, this is Manhattan.  The Bretonians are in orbit, launching landing ships to the surface.  The president is dead, and they&#8217;re inside Naval HQ.  They came from Colorado, too many of them.  All units, disperse.  Repeat, all units, DISPERSE.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Then, Black watched with utter shock as the Admiral drew his sidearm and jogged off-screen. 
<br />
<br />So that was it, then.  Liberty, his home.. GONE.  They were finished.  
<br />
<br />No, they weren&#8217;t finished quite yet, he told himself.  As long as he was alive, he swore he would seek to avenge the loss of his house.  
<br />
<br />Only the Jefferson and the Maine were left, and they were almost away from the Bretonian fleet, but then.. Three enemy battleships came up from the side, and opened up before Black could issue an order.  All their fire converged on the Maine, which was closer to them, and Black watched as they tore the ship to pieces.  On his screen, he saw a shot hit the bridge behind Serena, and then saw her and all of her staff pulled out of the ship with the escaping air, along with any other loose objects.  
<br />
<br />The Jefferson returned fire, but to no avail.  The Maine went up in a tremendous explosion, with all hands lost.  
<br />
<br />Then they concentrated on the Jefferson.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Shields are gone!  We lost guns 3 and 4!  Compartments C15-35 are open to space!..&#8221;
<br />
<br />The damage report continued, but Black couldn&#8217;t listen any more.  They were finished.  There was nothing more they could do to save the ship, or to take out any of the enemy.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fox, abandon ship.&#8221;
