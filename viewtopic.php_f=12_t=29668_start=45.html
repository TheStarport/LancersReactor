			<div class="content">this is what i do: (i started over)

<br />1. buy the temple as soon as u can afford it
<br />2. keep getting more people until u buy the archery (when u have enough money)
<br />3. when u buy the archery, train every single person
<br />4. in every stage get as many people as u can (DONT TRAIN THEM YET)
<br />5. in the next round, train all of the people that u got from the last stage
<br />6. at level 12 or so, buy the workshop
<br />7.  train 2 peple for that every stage (3 when neccessary)
<br />
<br />...thats good enough right?</div>

			<div class="content">Ok, Defend the Castle - The DEFINITIVE Guide - I'm on level 34 and its still self-sufficient! <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />FLINGING 
<br />first of all sort out your flinging technique!  The first 9-12 levels are easy if you can sort out your fling!  The best method I've found so far is to hover on the left side of the screen where the stickmen cometh and fling them straight up or straight up and to the left.  The reason for this is because your mouse always ends up back in the same position, saving any unnecessary mouse movement that could cost you time when things speed up.
<br />
<br />QUALITY
<br />play the first 10 levels on &quot;low quality&quot; (hit the big &quot;Q&quot; in the bottom right).  It will play faster, which in the early levels is a god-send because it can get quite tedious....then at level 10 switch to high quality and you'll notice that its slowed down a bit, so your toned reflexes can cope a bit better.  Trust me on that it works!
<br />
<br />KEEPING YOUR MEN ALIVE
<br />This is easy when you know how, it just takes a little bit of maths.  Its all to do with &quot;Unit Upkeep&quot;.  When men have been converted (see &quot;converting the enemy&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and appear in the top right of your screen as glowing stickmen, the cost nothing to keep there.  If you train them as wizards they cost 200 spendable points each...Archers are about 50sp as are Repairmen.  Account for every man that you are using as 200sp to be safe.  So if you have 30 Wizards, 10 Archers and 5 Repairmen, your unit upkeep is going to cost 45men x 200sp = 9000 spendable points.  NOW HERE'S THE TRICK - BEFORE you start a level you have to make sure that you have enough spendable points in your kitty to pay for your men.  I know you're going to earn a load during the level, but they DON'T count...its all to do with preparing for the cost.  So the trick is NEVER spend all of your points, make sure you always have enough left before starting the level to pay for your convertees.  Got it?!
<br />
<br />CONVERTING THE ENEMY
<br />The key to beating this game is converting the enemy.  There are two ways to do this.  Firstly, if you own a temple, you can pick up any of the SMALL stickmen (giants just stop and bend over if you click them) and drop them gently into your castle.  A yellow beam will show that someone is being converted and when complete he will appear as a glowing stickman under your score.  REMEMBER you can only convert one man at a time with the temple, you have to wait for the yellow light to dissappear or else you are effectively giving the enemy the opportunity to get closer to your castle for free.  The second way is to buy lots of wizards - multiples of 17 to be precise! (yes I know I'm sad working that out! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) Buy 17 wizards and you will notice that there is a third spell that you can use - a blue circle with a stickman in it - this is the conversion spell.  Click on the circle, your cursor changes to a cross, then click on an enemy and voila he will be instantly converted to your cause.  This is the quickest method, and to beat the game you need to get to this point AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Converting giants will be your saviour.
<br />
<br />THE ENEMY
<br />Stickman - easy to dispatch, slow moving, if you have lots of enemy at you kill these ones last
<br />Running Stickman - Moves a little faster, but still easy to dispatch
<br />Logman - Extremely slow moving, does more damage if he reaches your castle
<br />Giant - The bane of all stickmen, appears at about level 14, does lots of damage when he reaches your castle, cannot be picked up, easily dispatched with wizards
<br />Running Giant - same as above but faster, appears around about level 16
<br />Suicide Bombers - These little gits do a lot of damage to your castle but are superb for getting rid of the enemy.  For some reason, the coders allow you to click on the bomber and he will blow up all of his mates.  They appear at about level 19/20 and the game becomes a whole lot easier because of them.
<br />
<br />THE METHOD!! - I promise you that this works, this is my third attempt at the method and it hasn't failed me yet.
<br />
<br />1. Buy a temple as soon as humanly possible - probably at about level 4 or 5 I would have thought.
<br />2. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ELSE until about level 11. As soon as you have the temple start converting.  You should be able to convert 3-6 men per level, I average about 5.  You will notice after a while that the glowing men have reached the edge of the screen and it looks like you are not converting any more.  Don't worry, the game is still tallying them up for you, its just not showing you the number - useful because by about level 20 with this method you should have converted close to 500.
<br />3. At about level 11, buy a Mana Pool. DO NOT buy an archery yet, its useless right now and will cost you, DO NOT buy a Demolition Lab EVER, they are a waste of convertees.  Make sure when you buy your mana pool that you have about 10,000 points left to play with....this is going to be your money pot...never spend less than this and for the next 5 or 6 levels you won't lose any men (see &quot;Keeping your men Alive&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />4. Here comes the bit that you need to start practicing.  The first stickman on screen, pick him up and drop him in the temple.  Next, buy 17-20 Wizards (click on the flag).  Keep an eye on the &quot;mana bar&quot;, there are three spells - &quot;instant kill&quot;, &quot;bomb&quot; and &quot;convert&quot;.  You need next to no mana to do an instant kill - but don't use this spell unless you are faced with a giant bashing at your door.  The bomb is useful if you are over-run by the enemy, but again, try not to use it unless you are over-run by giants.  The convert spell uses a lot of mana but is the most important spell - for the next couple of levels try not to use anything apart from this spell...if faced with a giant, convert him.
<br />5. Each level things get faster and you are faced with more and more giants.  Don't buy any buildings, use all of your spendable points for Unit Upkeep.  Plough all of your convertees into wizards - the mana refresh will speed up and you'll find that you can convert 3 or 4 enemy at a time without the mana running out.  When you can no longer convert, switch to bomb and take out the excess stickmen, your mana will continue to refresh as you do so.  When you have enough to convert again, switch back to that.   Using this method by level 16 I have usually converted well over a hundred men....at least 60 of which I use as wizards (the rest come in handy later)
<br />6.  When you get to level 17, buy a workshop and account for 10 men being put into it.  Buy as many &quot;fortify x 10&quot; as you can afford without affecting your unit upkeep.  Start the level and plough 10 men into the workshop to strengthen your defenses as things get faster.  Carry on with converting as many men as possible.  If in doubt CONVERT! By level 19 you should have at least 150 wizards, your mana will be flowing sweetly and I doubt you will be flinging very much.
<br />7. When you hit level 20 the suicide bombers cometh.  These are little stickmen carrying explosives.  When the appear, let them walk about half way to the castle and then click on them to detonate them. They are quite slow moving, so by letting them get this far you are likely to be taking out 10-20 enemy with a single click.  Useful little buggers.  Carry on converting - convert the giants if they are giving you grief!
<br />8. Level 21 - now buy an archery (account for 100 more men in your unit upkeep) - start the level and turn 50-100 of your convertees into archers and about 20-30 convertees into repair men.  Play as normal.
<br />9. Level 22 - fortify you walls (x10) as much as you can afford and change convertees into archers and repairmen.
<br />
<br />Now here's the key....if you have 150-200 wizards that you have been using for constant conversion, 150+ archers, 50+ repair men and your walls are fortified to a minimum of 100,000 then your castle will be self-sufficient.  Sit back, let it run, men will reach your castle but the repairmen will counter everything they do and the archers will kill them quickly.  You will finish each level with no effort and no damage!
<br />
<br />I'm now on level 34 with 300 Wizards, 200 archers, 100 reparmen and my walls are fortified to 200000.  My points are in excess of 5 million and I haven't touched it for 12 levels.

			<div class="content">true, but I'm up to level 71 and still going....I was interested to see what happens when you get 1000 archers (it displays it as 100 - someone didn't think ahead <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), so now I want to know what happens when you get to level 100...!
<br />
<br />I know I'm sad, but its becoming a hobby for me, it sits at the bottom of the screen and I just open it up every half hour and set it off onto the next level <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
