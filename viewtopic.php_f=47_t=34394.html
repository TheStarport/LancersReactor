<br />Coalition vs. Alliance Pt. 1: The Coalition's True Colors
<br />
<br />    It was the 23rd century, and mankind had flourished. Two factions made up almost 90% of the human race, the Coalition and the Alliance. There had been numerous outbreaks of small toggles, but nothing serous. This trouble had been going on for almost two years, and only three people had died. But little did any one know, that was all about to change.........
<br />
<br />
<br />Alliance Navy Ship Yamato. June 16th 2160
<br />
<br />
<br />      &quot;As I'm sure you all know, the Balma Treaty is about to be signed on Europa. Although this officially marks the end of our trouble with the Coalition, we still have to deal with the pirate problem in this sector. This is our last day in Neptune space before we return to Earth, so let's make this a good and clean patrol. Dismissed.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Aticias, you commin' to the party tonight?&quot; A man said over his shoulder.
<br />&quot;Sorry, don't think I will be able to make it. I got stuck with Ronian wing doing a patrol around Triton.&quot; Aticias said as the two headed for the landing bay.
<br />&quot;Too bad, but I know what you mean. Being in the Alliance navy kind of sucks sometimes.&quot;
<br />&quot;Ain't that the truth. Well, see ya later.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The door slid into it's pocket and Aticias walked into the loading dock and climbed aboard his ship. He liked his Predator very much. Not only was it very fast, but it also had blind fire, making it a lot easier to dogfight with. 
<br />
<br />After going through his pre- flight check sequence, the green light on his console came on, indicating that everything was ready for flight. The engines came on line and his ship rose above the floor. He went to the airlock chamber and prepared for launch.
<br />
<br />When he was in space, he could see Neptune off in the distance, and the rest of his wing waiting a short distance off. The colonel came over the radio.
<br />
<br />&quot;Some people get to witness the signing of the Balma Treaty, us, we get stuck flying around in the vain hope some pirate will be stupid enough to attack us.&quot;
<br />&quot;Complaining again Colonel? Thats a surprise.&quot;
<br />&quot;Hey Aticias, why don't you just concentrate on being a good co- pilot!&quot;
<br />&quot;Perhaps both of you would prefer a cargo run next time, it can be arranged. Lets move out.&quot;
<br />
<br />All of the ships engaged their Jump engines and sped away from the Yamato.
<br />
<br />As the Ronian wing neared the rendezvous point, a large piece of debris came into view. It was then that Aticias noticed it was the remains of the convoy they were supposed to encounter.
<br />
<br />&quot;Heads up, pirates have tagged the convoy. Picking up multiple hostile contacts on scanners.&quot; Pirates surrounded the Ronian wing and opened fire.
<br />
<br />Aticias, being an expert pilot, dodged and weaved his way through the fire and easily took out two pirate ships. &quot;C'mon, we have to finish these pirates!&quot; Shouted the wing commander over the radio. 
<br />
<br />After a short fight only two pirates remained, and after Yotso Shikigami(The wing commander) launched one of his jackhammers up the pirates exhaust pipe, only one was left. He engaged his Jump engines and sped off.
<br />
<br />&quot;One of the pirates has managed to Jump out.&quot; Aticias said.
<br />&quot;Ronian wing, did you manage to get a lock on him?&quot; Yotso asked.
<br />&quot;Yeh, he'se heading for the Callean Asteroid Belt.&quot;
<br />&quot;Good, let's go.&quot; Ordered Yotso.
<br />
<br />Jump engines roared to life and they all Jumped off to the Asteroid belt.
<br />
<br />As they neared the asteroid field, they could see the pirate that had managed to escape. But all of the sudden, Aticias's scanners began to act weird.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm picking up three large energy signatures hiding in the asteroid belt. Woh! Wait a minute, those arn't pirate ships, those are Coalition Cruisers. What the Hell are they doing here?&quot; Just as they were looking at the cruisers, two wings of fighters jumped in. &quot;I've got multiple Coalition boogies inbound.&quot; Aticias said. The newly- arrived ships opened fire on the Ronain wing, killing the Colonel almost instantly.
<br />
<br />&quot;We have to jump out, we will get slaughtered if we stay here!&quot; Aticias warned.
<br />&quot;There's an early warning station on the edge of the Asteroid belt, we can warn the Yamato from there.&quot;
<br />
<br />All but one of the remaining ships managed to jump out, and the one left- behind went up in a fiery explosion. 
<br />
<br />As the Ronain wing neared the EWS(Early Warning Station) 88179, a voice came over the comms channel. &quot;Thank God your here Ronain wing, these pirates just came out of nowhere and attacked us.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;EWS 88179, those arn't pirates, it's a Coalition hunting pack in disguise. Patch to a comms link to the ANS Yamato. We'll take of these morons.&quot;
<br />
<br />The Ronain wing engaged the fighters and took out three of them very easily. As Aticias brought down another fighter, his scanners beeped.
<br />
<br />&quot;I've got two Coalition Torp bombers, backed up by two wings of laggs, jumping in.&quot; Aticias said, preparing to fire his Jackhammers at the bombers. 
<br />
<br />Before he could do anything, they fired torpedoes and jumped out. &quot;They've launched torpedoes.&quot; Came a frantic call over the comms channel. &quot;Ronian wing, we have to take out those torps, they're our number one priority.&quot; Everyone did as they were told, but only one of the torpedoes were destroyed. &quot;Were hit! Where's that fighter cover?&quot; Several more torpedoes made contact with the base, and it went up in a fiery explosion. &quot;No! We've lost the Early Warning Station. Ronian wing, finish these fighters and let's get back to base.&quot; 
<br />
<br />After a fight that lasted almost half- an- hour, all of the Coalition fighters were destroyed. But the price was heavy, they had also lost three of their own men and women. Of the original eight, only four were left. The last fighter had managed to eject before his ship exploded, but Aticias shot and destroyed it before he had a chance to call a &quot;Mayday&quot;. The remaining ships charged their jump engines and plotted a course for the Yamato. After the engines were fully charged, they jumped out.
<br />
<br />When they arrived at the Yamato and one other large ship, a frantic call came over the radio. &quot;Where the Hell have you been Ronian wing? The Yamato's taking damage and the Kessler's hull integrity is down to 30%.&quot; Aticias engaged the nearest fighter and, being the expert pilot he was, killed him in under ten seconds. He looked out his left cockpit window just in time to see three Coalition cruisers jumping in. &quot;Launching first salvo.&quot; The commander of the middle cruiser said over his radio. Four torpedoes came out of the tunnel- like docking bay of the cruiser, and headed for the Yamato at breakneck speed. 
<br />
<br />After firing their lasers, only one torpedo remained. It was now 4/5 of the way to the Yamato, and closing fast. The only fighter not being chased by a Coalition ship was Yotso's, and both of his wings had been blown off, leaving him defenseless. It was then that he made the most difficult decision of his life. He punched the after- burner and accelerated after the torpedo. He was only about 100 feet away from it when he got very close, and flying only a few inches above it, began to outrun it. He dipped the nose of his ship right in front of it. His ship exploded and the last torpedo was taken care of, while Aticias's scanners beeped wildly again. &quot;I'm picking up another vessel jumping in, I can't tell what it is yet.-&quot; There was a short pause. &quot;Yes! It's the Victorias, is she a sight for sore eyes.&quot; The carrier came to a stop, and fired it's own torpedoes at the Cruisers. There was an explosion off in the distance, and as everyone turned to look, they could see the Kessler had been destroyed. &quot;No! They've taken out the Kessler. Those scum are going to pay for this.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Sense these chapters are going to be sort of long, I might only be able to get them up every two or three days.

<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;No! They've taken out the Kessler. Those scum are going to pay for this.&quot; said the bridge officer from the Yamato. Aticias turned to the Coalition Cruisers and fired all of Screamers (pod of 20 dumb fire rockets. Most effective when used in salvos.) at the first one. It took minor damage, but nothing serous. Just as Aticais was ready to fire his Jackhammers, which could take out the Cruiser if everyone fired at once, the Victorias launched it's torpedos. The middle cruiser exploded, damaging the one on it's left. Aticias fired one of his Jackhammers at the cruiser on the right, damaging it slightly. Before he had a chance to arm the next one, a fighter opened fire. Aticias dipped and weaved out of the fire, using his Bandit ( a missile designed to destroy a ships hull.) killed the pilot.
<br />
<br />The Yamato got involved at this point, firing it's own torpedos at the remaining Coalition Cruiser. Just when the torpedos were almost to the third cruiser, it jumped out. It was then Aticias realized why the Cruiser hadn't fired on him for almost a minute, it was charging it's Jump Drive engines. Aticias used his scanners to track the Ion trail left when a ship jumps out, regardless of size. He shook the fighter off of him and charged up his own engines. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Aticias, what the hell are you doing?&quot; said one of his wingmen.
<br />&quot;We can't let that Cruiser get word to the main Coalition base, maybe the Coalition doesn't know that were on to them yet. If we stop it, they won't be able to tell Jose' Rodriguez that we know.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is suicide and you know it!&quot;
<br />&quot;Then come with me if you want, but I'm going to stop that cruiser.&quot;
<br />&quot;Negative Rockford, you are to return to the Yamato immediately. That is a direct order from commander Enriguez.&quot; Came the voice of a bridge officer on the Yamato.
<br />&quot;Yamato control, I refuse to follow that order. I'm taking down that cruiser, now ether your with me, or against me.&quot; Aticias replied with confidence. 
<br />
<br />He jumped out in pursuit of the Cruiser, followed by two men from his own wing. When he reached the point where the Cruiser's Ion trail had disappeared, he used the full sector scan, and picking up the cruiser, used afterburners to follow. His wingmen did the same. When he could see the cruiser with his eyes, he fired all of his Jackhammers at the ship, and the others did the same. This destroyed the cruiser, leaving only five fighters remaining. After a quick dogfight, all of the fighters were taken care of, but off in the distance, a large ship loomed. It looked very small from where they were, having part of the sun blocked by Mars, but it was moving very slowly, giving the impression that it was very massive. All of the sudden it jumped out, leaving a huge, visible, red Ion trail behind. 
<br />
<br />&quot;C'mon, we had better get back to the Yamato.&quot; Said his wingmen, who's nickname was Sadono (a terroist from the 21st century.)
<br />
<br />Both ships jumped out, and when they reached the Yamato, were stunned to see that there were no ships in space expert the Yamato and the Victorias. Just as Aticias and Sadono prepared to dock, a large ship jumped in. &quot;WOH! Holy crap! I've got a visual on a Class 1 Carrier,. Oh man, we are in real trouble.&quot; Said Aticias over the radio. The Carrier launched torpedos at the Yamato, and fired at the fighters that had just launched. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ronian wing, this is Yamato control. You have to tag the torps, if we lose the Yamato, then the Alliance is finished.&quot;
<br />
<br />Everyone concentrated their fire on the torpedos, but several fighters blocked them. Before Aticias had a chance to react, an Alliance patrol wing jumped in. &quot;Heard you guys could use some help.&quot; The wing commander said over the radio. The Gamma wing engaged the Coalition fighters and the Victorias prepared to launch torpedos. The torpedos that were heading to the Yamato were destroyed, and the remaining Coalition fighters tried to neutralize the Victorias's missiles. But before any of the Coalition fighters had a chance to destroy one of them, all of the torpedos made contact with the Carrier. They all found their mark, and the Coalition Carrier named the Pukov, was destroyed. 
<br />
<br />Aticias and the rest of the Ronian and Gamma wings killed the remaining Coalition fighters before any of them had a chance to jump out. When the last one was destroyed, Commander Enriguez came over the radio. &quot;Rockford, dock with the Yamato immediately, you disobeyed a direct order! You will be punished for it.&quot; she said sternly. Aticias, now with butterflies in his stomach, landed on the Yamato....
<br />

<br />Coalition vs. Alliance Pt. 3: Caught in the Crossfire
<br />
<br />  &quot;You disobeyed a direct order! I should demote you to the rank of a recruit, I don't know how you even became a general in the first place. You are just irresponsible Rockford. I ought' have you kicked off the Alliance Navy for that stunt you pulled back there. But because we are at an all-out war with the Coalition is the only thing that saved your sorry hide!&quot; Commander Enriguez yelled into Aticias's face. Although she was right about him disobeying a direct order, he still felt like he saved thousands of lives.
<br />
<br />When it appeared Commander Enriguez was done yelling at him, he got up to leave. But before he had a chance, one of his wingmen walked into the room and faced her.
<br />
<br />&quot;Commander Enriguez, Raoul Jakarta, I am also known as 'Sadono' on the Ronian Wing. I have come here because I really don't think you should blame Mr. Rockford for what he did. I agree with you that it was wrong for him to disobey a direct order like he did, but he saved almost one million lives.&quot; Sadono said sternly.
<br />&quot;Well then, what would you suggest I do with him, hum? Make him Commander Rockford? Or better yet, how about president of the Alliance. How does that sound to you Jakarta?&quot; She said in a hissing voice. When he did not respond she continued, &quot;Maybe I should turn him over to the Coalition, let them deal with him. Or, you could put on a space suit and be attached to the Yamato with a cable, and we jump out and fling you toard the sun! How does that sound?&quot; She said, almost smiling.
<br />
<br />Just before she was about to go off again, a man came running into the room. &quot;Commander Enriguez, we have detected five Coalition Cruisers heading for the Yamato. They will be here in less than a minute, where do you want us to jump to.?&quot; She thought hard for a moment, then looked up at the man. &quot;Take us to Pluto.&quot; Aticias stood up to leave, but Commander Enriguez stopped him. &quot;I'm not done with you yet Rockford. You just stay right where you are!&quot; She hissed. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Commander, the Coalition Cruisers are jumping in right now!&quot; The man said, looking out the window. Aticias stood up again and headed for the door, when Commander Enriguez held up her hand again, he ignored it and kept on walking. &quot;Aticias Rockford!&quot; She yelled behind him, but did not follow. &quot;I'm going out there and risking my life to save your sorry hide! If those cruisers launch torpedos and we don't have time to jump out, were all dead! The least you could say is good luck. Now, I'm going weather you like it or not! Unless you can stop me yourself, I'm going.&quot; He said calmly and ran to the docking bay.
<br />
<br />When he reached the docking bay, he climbed into his Predator and fired up the engines. After he was in space, he engaged the nearest fighter, killing him in under a minute. Right before he took out another fighter, an extremely large ship jumped in. It was clear that it was Coalition, but he had never seen a ship so big in all of his life. The words on the side read<b> Coalition Juggernutt Shinron </b>, with the &quot;Sword and Snake&quot; logo on the side.
<br />
<br />The Yamato's Jump Drive engines were now 85% charged, and was almost ready to jump out. Before they had a chance to jump out, the Coalition Juggernutt's massive front cannon began to spin, and after spinning for a few seconds, a blue glow began to surround it. It fired the front cannon, and destroyed the Yamato with one shot, leaving the Alliance solders just confounded. Before anyone had a chance to react, it fired again on the Victorias. One shot destroyed it's left docking bay, and damaged it badly.
<br />
<br />But it was far from over, for the Juggernutt prepared to fire again. When it did, the Victorias went up in an amazing explosion. Both the Yamato and the Victorias were now gone, the two capital ships for the Alliance Navy. And now, their chances of becoming victorious over the Coalition were now slim to none. Aticias, with vengeance in his heart, began to fire at the bridge of the Shinron with all that his ship could offer. He fired all of his Jackhammers and began to fire his front cannons, but all of his effort was in vain.
<br />
<br />When the wing of Alliance cruisers jumped in that the Yamato was expecting, the Juggernutt fired on them. Three of the five Cruisers went down instantly, another was severely damaged. The order came over the radio for all remaining Alliance personnel to jump out to Pluto while they still could, but Aticias refused. After a moment, he was all that remained, and he was not going down without a fight. He launched his Afterburner Fuel Pod at the bridge, destroying it almost instantly. But the bridge was not the only command deck on the Shinron, and the large ship remained under control.  
<br />
<br />It fired it's front cannons again at the Cruisers, and Aticias was right in the crossfire. The large blue beam struck his ship, and the heat became unbearable. He was surrounded by blue light, and his life had been relatively short, only 34 years. His cockpit window cracked, and shattered. The pressure and heat was immense, and all went dark, then light, blessed light.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />And so on this day, almost two thousand Alliance solders were killed. Among them were Commander Jessica Enriguez, Raoul Jakarta, and Aticias Rockford. But their legend does not end here, for Aticias had a son, his name was Aticias Rockford II. Although he was not yet born, and his mother only three months pregnant, the legend of the Rockfords will live on..........
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />caught by the surprise at the end? Thought so.... anyway, this is by no means the end of my story. I am planing for it to span over three generations and 98 years. I will continue when I get the chance, but it might be a few days. Although this marks the end of Coalition vs. Alliance, I am planning two more parts for it. And I promise you, the next parts will be longer...much longer <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> . As to when I will have the next saga ready, I still have no idea, but it should be within a week or so.....
<br />
<br />
<br />and sorry for the long wait. But I am hoping my scheduel will stay seady from now on.</div>
