<br />
<br />Thats right, this is no dream. I'm back guys and seeing as i do feel bad for keeping you all waiting i allowed myself at work today to think about chapter 8. Which of course is why i'm posting now. Thats right, you heard, its Chapter 8 and its coming at you. Word of warning on this one, not very eventful, this chapter is purely to eanble the &quot;plot to thicken&quot; as it where. I hope you enjoy, more will come soon!<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 8 - New Intelligence  </b>
<br />
<br />Back on Sprague, Orillion was with Quintaine and Sinclair as they studied the Alien spacecraft.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The engineering is very crude, wouldn&#8217;t you say doctor?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, it is most definitely of a strange design. Unlike anything I have ever seen before&#8221; he replied.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Do you think it could be some kind of House prototype that we don&#8217;t know about?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so&#8221; answered Sinclair. &#8220;Not unless the houses are going backwards these days. Initial scans show that it can just about out gun the Liberty Defender. Not very impressive by any means.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Orillion nodded. &#8220;Report to me as soon as you get something, no matter how small&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We will&#8221; replied Quintaine.
<br />
<br />Orillion left their side and made his back across the landing pad. He stood for a moment in the centre and marvelled at what was all around him. He took pride knowing that without his and everyone else&#8217;s help, the Dom Kavash probably wouldn&#8217;t even exist anymore.
<br />
<br />He continued his walk over to the medical facility were the human pilot was being held. The walked through the door into the corridor that lead to the medical bay. Two Dom Kavash doctors came out of the room silently as Orillion entered. There was one doctor still remaining in the room.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Any news?&#8221; asked Orillion as he walked to the end of the patients bed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Nothing yet Mr Orillion.&#8221; Replied the doctor.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Can we not just wake him?&#8221; he asked. The man was lying on the bed unconscious.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No. That would be to dangerous. If we forcefully wake him, we could cause severe neural damage. He won&#8217;t be of use to anyone.&#8221; Replied the doctor.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very well&#8221;
<br />
<br />The doctor got up to leave the room.
<br />
<br />Orillion took a seat opposite the mans bed with a concerned look on his face. Who was this man? Why was he here? But more importantly, where did he come from? These were the questions Orillion wanted answers to. He was hoping that the strange man would be ok. 
<br />
<br />As he started to settle further back into his chair, Quintaine came over on communications.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Orillion, you better get over here, we&#8217;ve found something&#8221; he said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is it professor?&#8221; replied Orillion, clearly curious as to what Quintaine may have uncovered.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think you better see with your own eyes&#8221;
<br />
<br />Orillion got up out of the chair and gave a glance over to the man.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You better pull through&#8221; he said as he walked out to make his way back to Quintaine.
<br />
<br />Orillion arrived to find Dr Sinclair getting out of the ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Where is Quintaine?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;He&#8217;s in there. You better take a look at what he has found&#8221;
<br />
<br />Orillion stepped in to the craft. Quintaine was sitting at a console.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Orillion peering over Quintaine&#8217;s shoulder.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Here&#8221; Quintaine pressed a few of the buttons on the ships console and the cockpit lit up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So, we have power. Is this what you wanted me to see?&#8221; said Orillion somewhat annoyed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No&#8221; replied Quintaine. &#8220;This is what I wanted to show you&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quintaine pressed a few more of the switches and a display popped down from the roof of the cockpit. Alien words began to scroll rapidly down the screen as if the ship was running some form of internal diagnostic.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s all very pretty doctor, but unfortunately, my alien is not quite fluent. What does this all this mean?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; he replied. &#8220;When Trent gets back with computer, maybe this will be of some help&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quintaine pressed another button on the console. The screen went static for a few moments and a video feed came onto the screen. It was the man in the medical bay.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think this is kind of a &#8220;Ship&#8217;s log&#8221;, similar to our neural net logs&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fascinating!&#8221; said Orillion happy with what the doctor discovered. &#8220;He looks very nervous doesn&#8217;t he? Who the hell is he?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes. We still can&#8217;t understand what he is saying. This we won&#8217;t know unless the Hispanic computer can bring up some answers. Hopefully then, we to can solve the puzzle of his identity.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Have you heard anything from Trent yet?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No. I have sent word to him that the Hispanic Prime Minister will allow them to recover the computer. Hopefully he should receive it soon and we should start getting some answers to this mystery&#8221;

<br /><b>Chapter 9 - &quot;Mark My Words&quot;  </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />The 5 allied ships proceeded from the ruins of Freeport 10 to continue the final part of their journey, the jump hole to Omicron Alpha.
<br />
<br />As they approached the jump hole, Trent&#8217;s cockpit console warned him of an incoming message. It had been from Quintaine. The Prime minister of Hispania had granted them access to the Hispania&#8217;s on board computer. Excellent news he thought to himself. The last thing they all needed was a fight with the Hispanic navy.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok everyone, we have been granted salvage access to the Hispanic computer. When we clear the jump hole, stand down your weapons.&#8221; Said Trent to everyone. Sergio and his brothers were playing on his mind.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be a good idea for you to enter Hispanic space in those ships&#8221; said Trent to Sergio. &#8220;Our safety is guaranteed, but I can&#8217;t promise you yours is&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You are right Mr Trent. My brothers and I shall leave you to continue your mission. But please consider my words, nothing, I repeat nothing is what it seems.&#8221;
<br />
<br />With that the two remaining Titan&#8217;s turned around and headed back. Sergio&#8217;s words had sent a chill down Trent&#8217;s spine. He cleared his thoughts and tried to concentrate on the goal at hand.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Juni, King, are you ready?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />The both replied positively.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, follow me&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent slipped through the jump hole. Juni and King followed right behind him. 
<br />
<br />As the exited the jump hole, a wing of Hispanic naval ships were waiting for them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mr Trent, please will you and your friends follow us, we will take you to the wreckage&#8221; said the commanding officer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent and the others followed the escort wing through to the wreckage of the Hispanic Sleeper ship. Trent looked on in awe of the once mighty vessel. None of them had ever been so close to the ship before.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I wonder what really happened to her&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Beats me&#8221; said King. &#8220; We wouldn&#8217;t have had problems with the Outcasts or Corsairs if their sleeper ship had remained in one piece&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Here we are. Please be careful. She has been here for a long time and it reminds us of where we come from&#8221; said the officer with a strong sense of pride. The escort wing proceeded to fly away. There were not going to stay to watch.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Lets get this over and done with&#8221; said Trent as he carefully manoeuvred his DK Anubis through the ships debris. &#8220;Sensors indicate that the computer is still in tact&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Excellent&#8221; replied Juni. &#8220;Lets just hope that that it provides us with the answers we need&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;After what we&#8217;ve just been through, we better&#8221; said King.
<br />
<br />The three of them moved deeper into the wreckage when Trent&#8217;s sensor went off alerting them of the computers close proximity. He started to look around for it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There it is&#8221; he said. The computer was floating freely inside the debris. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tractor it in so we can get out of here&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />Trent activated his tractor beam and slowly brought it into his cargo hold.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, job done. Lets go.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;About time&#8221; said King.
<br />
<br />Trent, Juni and King proceeded t o steer themselves out of the wreckage.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Escort leader, we have the computer. Thank you for you co-operation&#8221; said Trent sending a long range communication to the Escort commander.
<br />
<br />They activated their cruise engines and proceeded to head towards the jump hole.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok Trent, take point&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;With&#8230;what the!?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Trent stopped mid sentence. What appeared before the three friends caught them off guard. Three Rheinland Valkyries had decloaked right in front of the jump hole.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Do not open fire!&#8221; came the first communication from the lead ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Great, more surprise guests&#8221; sighed King.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Identify yourselves&#8221; requested Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We have been sent to give you a message&#8221; came the reply.
<br />
<br />&#8220;From whom?&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I cannot give too many details. This communication channel has been breached. We are downloading the message in to your neural nets, goodbye&#8221;
<br />
<br />With that, the Valkyries cloaked and disappeared off of everyone&#8217;s scanners.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell was that all about?&#8221; said King.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Check your neural net King&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />Trent had activated his and was reading the message they had just been sent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The war is not over. What you all participated in 6 months ago was just the beginning. They are preparing their assault and nothing will survive. They know we know. Please help us. Meet what is left of us at the co-ordinates at the end of this message. There is little time. Z.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Trent looked directly in front of him where the 3 Valkyries were just a few moments ago.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m going&#8221; he said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait Trent, what about the computer, the mission?&#8221; replied Juni.
<br />
<br />Trent jettisoned the computer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There, take it. Make sure you get it safely to Quintaine and Sinclair. I&#8217;m going to check this out&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you&#8221; said King.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No King, stay with Juni. That computer needs to get to Quintaine in one piece&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok buddy. But be careful. We want you back in one piece to&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Be careful Trent&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me. Worry about getting back to Quintaine safely. See you soon&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent came about and hit his cruise engine&#8217;s and made his way to the co-ordinates left by the Valkyries. He had no idea where it would take him.

When those Rheinland ships uncloaked, I was thinking it was the start of another problem with Rheinland. I really expected them to have to fight. This is good Bret, keep it up. Remember our little deal. It might still be a couple of days before I can get my next part up though, but you have no excuse for making us wait, so don't even try it. *Shakes fist*

<br />
<br />Thanks for your comments again guys. I really appreciate it.
<br />
<br />Everyone ready for another exciting installment of Bret Fic? I thought so. Wilde i hope your still going to hang around the fanfic forum in light of what you said in OT. Anyway here is Chapter 10, bit of a favourite this. Ah who am i kidding, this is clearly  my most favourite chapter i have *ever* written out of all the stories i have ever written. Hope you all enjoy reading it as much as i have enjoyed writing this one. Chapter 11 will come later in the week<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 10 - Impossible  </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />As Juni and King watched and waited for Trent to leave scanner range, they continued their journey back to Sprague.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I hope he gets to where ever it is he is going ok &#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry Juni&#8221; replied King. &#8220;Trent&#8217;s tough remember. He faced up to many Nomads in his time and there are few more dangerous than them&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thanks King&#8221; said Juni with a slight smile. 
<br />
<br />The flight back to Sprague was much less eventful than it was on the way to the computer. 
<br />
<br />Juni and King cut their cruise engine&#8217;s to await clearance at Aldershot Station. A familiar voice was there to great them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ms Zane, Commander King, good to see you have returned safely&#8221; said Parkin. &#8220;Follow me, I&#8217;ll escort you to the planet.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Juni and King followed Parkin through the jump gate and entered formation with him on the other side.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Quintaine will be happy to see you&#8221; said Parkin.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This thing better give the answers we are looking for. With what we have just been through I&#8217;ll be making that computer as derelict as the Hispanic ship using my bare hands&#8221; said King angrily.
<br />
<br />As Sprague came into view, Juni felt a sigh of relief wash over her. Although Trent was still out there, Kings earlier words made her feel a lot more comfortable about the situation even though she would have preferred it if she could be with him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Juni, King, you are cleared to dock, Professor Quintaine is waiting for you on the landing pad, good to see you again&#8221; came the voice from the DK docking ring.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s good to be back&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />Parkin proceeded to land with Juni and King on Sprague. The three of themslowly set the ships down on the pad. Orillion was with Quintaine.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ah, Juni, good to see you again. Have you brought the computer?&#8221; asked Quintaine.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, its in my cargo hold&#8221; she replied. 
<br />
<br />Two Dom Kavash guards came over and removed the computer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Take it to alien ship&#8221; said Quintaine. &#8220;Dr Sinclair is waiting for it&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes professor&#8221; replied the guards.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait a second, where&#8217;s Trent?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about it later Orillion&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />Orillion looked at her inquisitively. Why could she just not tell him there? He knew there must have been a good reason for it so he let it lie.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Did you want to come with me now while we activate the Hispanic computer. It shouldn&#8217;t take too long?&#8221; asked Quintaine.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ll catch up with you professor. I need to debrief Juni and King first&#8221; came Orillion&#8217;s reply.
<br />
<br />Quintaine nodded with approval and followed the guards back to the ship. With that, Parkin&#8217;s neural net alert went off in his pocket.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn, I gotta go, Bretonian business. Problem with being at the queens beckoning&#8221;
<br />
<br />Parkin went to his ship and left the surface for space.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, did the two of you want to tell me what happened out there and why Trent is not with you?&#8221;  
<br />
<br />&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s safe now&#8221; said Juni. &#8220;It started when we stopped off at Freeport 10. Unknown ships using jamming equipment attacked the station. We barely managed to get out in time. We recovered the computer fine but as we were about to leave Hispanic space, three Rheinland Valkyries decloaked in front of us. They wouldn&#8217;t tell us who they were as they believed the communication channel had been compromised. They left us this message though&#8221;
<br />
<br />Juni handed Orillion a copy of the message and a concerned look came over his face.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So I&#8217;m assuming Trent went, by himself, to check these co-ordinates?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes&#8221; said King.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Nobody else knows about this message yet do they?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No&#8221; replied Juni and King.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good. We will keep it that way until we find out who &#8220;Z&#8221; is and what the hell is going on around here&#8221;
<br />
<br />As they finished talking, a Dom Kavash guard walked over.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mr Orillion, professor Quintaine has activated the computer. He has requested your presence&#8221; said the guard.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you&#8221; replied Orillion. &#8220;Are you two coming?&#8221; he said to King and Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Of course&#8221; they replied as they began to follow Orillion to the ship.
<br />
<br />When they arrived, Quintaine had a joyful look on his face.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well professor?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It works. Kendra is just going through the data files now&#8221;
<br />
<br />The computer had been hooked up to a monitor so they could see the Hispanic logs. Everyone walked over and stood behind Sinclair.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is fascinating!&#8221; said Sinclair. She as clearly unable to hide her excitement. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well and good Doctor, but have you found anything yet?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;This looks promising&#8221; she replied. The monitor she was using was touch screen.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Got it!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Its translators for all of the earth nations had added over the years. There is more here than we could have ever dreamed of!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ll start with the writing on the side of the ship&#8221; said Quintaine. &#8220;Kendra, can you put that in there please? It&#8217;s going to take a little longer to translate the audio file on the ships log&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dr Sinclair typed in the writing on the side of the ship and everyone waited for hoping that the computer could translate it for her. 
<br />
<br />The screen flashed complete and a new window opened.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Excellent, we ha&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Orillion stopped mid sentence by what was before his eyes on the monitor. No one could believe what they were reading. It just wasn&#8217;t possible&#8230;
