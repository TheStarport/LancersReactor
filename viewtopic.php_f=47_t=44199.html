			<div class="content">hiya gents! Zeta1 here with an RPG i'll actually decide to do,lol. anyway, heres the deal. you dont control factions in this, only play with them. the thing that makes this rpg unique, is that you dont play as any of the houses, police, or militaries, or companies. Only criminals. The Outcasts, Lane Hackers, and Liberty Rouges have started a new group. The Tri Alliance. The Outcasts also have relations with anyone who wants Cardamine. Anyone who is a member of, The Maltarian Syndicate. Anyone who has alot of credits to join that is. 
<br />      The Red Hessians have formed an uneasy alliance with the Corsairs, founding the Othatie Coalition, in response to the Tri Alliance. The Hogosha, who work artifacts directly with the corsairs, are mindful of the Hessians, wondering if it is wise to allign themselves with such uneasy friends.
<br />   The Molly's are still at odds with the Corsairs, and now the Hessians for the Dublin gold fields, but will they be able to stand the Othatie Coalition onslaught?
<br />         The Junkers really don't know where to stand in this, so they have assumed a stance somewhat similar to that of the zoners, trying to keep it neutral, but this is a very dangerous game, how long can they stay that way?
<br />      The Xenos, as usual are hostile with pretty much everyone. [What else is new?
<br />       The Hogosha are fully allied with the Farmer's alliance, forming Greater Kusari, seeing that it is for the greater good of Kusari.
<br />     The Gainains have formed an Alliance with the Molly's, under the condition they help with freeing Edinburg, and They will protect and try to free Dublin.
<br />       The Blood Dragons and Golden C are fully allied, forming the Free Kusari Union, but the Blood Dragons are mindful of the GC's addiction to Cardamine, if they go to war with the Outcasts, will the Alliance hold? if so, will the GC survive without the cardamine in their systems? The Free Kusari Union also is at War with the Hogosha, but secretly attempting to sway the Farmer's Alliance to join the Free Kusari Union, promsising bountiful Farm subsidies if needed, and kicking out Synth Foods once they retake Kusari from the courrupt Kieretsu controlled goverment. [Kieretsu are Kirshio and Samura, huge goverment like companies wielding massive political and economical power.
<br />    The LWB, Unioners, and Bunshuch have formed an uneasy alliance, the New Rheinland Republic. however, it's uneasy do to the LWB and Unioners after different Companies, and the Bunshuch's distast for common piracy and killing, perfering a more peaceful action of demonstration for reforms. 
<br />     The LWB, Unioners, and Bunshuch would like to have better relations with the Hessians, but the relationship with them is only degrading since the New Rheinland Republic wants a better Rheinland, and Corsairs are enemies of Rheinland.
<br />
<br />That covers all the Criminal factions, play as a member of any one of them you want, but you must work with your allied players. But how long before the entire Sirius underworld errupts in Pandemonium and Bloodshed? Can it be stopped? You will decide! have fun, and repect other players.  Please also begin each post with the following.
<br />
<br />John doe/Liberty Rouge/Tri Alliance/Buffalo Base/Bloodhound/500credits.
<br />
<br />THERE YOU HAVE IT! ENJOY!</div>

<br />
<br />Jack Sedgwick sighed and buried his head deep into his hands, hoping they would help calm him and figure this out. Unfortunatly, they did little to console him.
<br />
<br /> In the last 3 days, just about every criminal faction in the entire Sirius sector alligned themselves with someone else or took some sort of stance. The Tri Alliance, rumors of the Oathtie Alliance in the far of Omega's, heard only by vetran Outcasts on buisness in Liberty and the surrounding Border Worlds.
<br />
<br />He knew one thing tho, with all these Alliances, a war had to break out soon, there were to many conflicting intrests.
<br />
<br />What about the Junkers? They couldn't stay neutral for long, they might become the Tri Alliance's enemies in a matter of hours, seeing how quick things took place in the last couple of days.
<br />
<br />The worst part was, there were rumors that the Tri Alliance would be moving into Bretonia, hopefully Via Trafaglar. But that would put them at odds with the corsairs. That would put the Junkers at odds with the Corsairs, and the Red Hessians, not that alot of them ever appeared in Bretonia, but now that they had acess to the Omega 5-Cambridge Jump Hole, Bretonia would see alot more Rheinlanders. 
<br />
<br />Moving into Bretonia also put them at odds with the Molly's and Gainas if an Alliance wouldn't be worked out. If not, they would be fighting a war on two fronts, turning the New London system into a warzone that made the past Omega 5 look like a little tikes playground.
<br />
<br />Poltics! Poltics! Politics! 
<br />
<br />Jack hated it, he wished for simpler times, oddly enough only 3 days ago, even tho it seemed like an eternity, it all starting with the Corsair alliance with the Hessians, starting a chain reaction throughout Sirius.
<br />
<br />Of course, since The Tri Alliance was part of The Maltarian Synticate, the Tri Alliance might not need to move into Bretonia to be put at odds with Corsairs, it seemed only a matter of time before The Otatie Alliance and the Maltarian Syndicate went into full blown war. But were the Red Hessians willing to stay the course thru that war? after all, The Othateie Alliance was formed to put a stop to the Bloodshed with the Corsairs and Red Hessians.
<br />
<br />The only thing Jack was sure about, was that the colonies would erupt into choas within the next few days....</div>

<br />
<br />Jack considered ordering another Magellan Martini Freeze, a popular Lane Hacker concotion, but thought better of it. He knew of Hackers who sold it.
<br />Jack needed some cash, so a simple trade run would get him some nice money. Perhaps he would take some Lane Hacker drinks odd commodities, and gold to Montezuma. Probably return with some H-fuel, Mactan was one of the highest paying places to take H-fuel in all of the colonies, but he heard it sold a little higher in places like hundreds of light-years away places like Cadiz, Crete, and Ruiz. He payed his bar tab and went on his way to the Commodity dealer. 
<br />         He walked into the large storage area in the Commodity room, his footsteps echoing throughout the large room. The Commodity dealer was engrossed looking over an info pad from his neural net that he didn't notice Jack coming. Jack cleared his throat. The medium built man imeditatly perked up, and walked over to him. &quot;Hello my good friend! What can I get for you?&quot; he asked in a delightful voice. Jack told the man what he wanted and he told him it would be loaded into his ship within the hour. Sure enough, an hour later his cargo was onboard and Jack took off. He laid in a course for the Curaco jump hole. He sat back in his chair and put his feet up and started to doze. Beep! Beep! &quot;Unidetified ships aproaching.&quot; the computor calmly awoke him.
<br />      He imeditatly scanne them and looked over his readouts. He nearly jump thru the cockpit window when he saw what type the ships were, and who they were. Two Corsair Centurion fighters.
<br />       &quot;Incoming hail.&quot; the computer announced. &quot;This is Corsairs, Green 15, drop your cargo or die.&quot; Jack cursed. This wasn't good.</div>

<br />Micheal Durham ducked back behind the corner. Zoom! Zoom! Zoom! laser shots whent bye where his head was. His cover must have been blown somehow. He unholstered his &quot;El Diablo&quot; Corsair Decimator launcher off of the strap strung to his back. He changed it to his desired setting and aimed around the corner for the ceiling above the ALG security guards. He pulled the trigger. The kick felt like being hit by a Clydesale. BOOM! the ceiling collapsed onto the men and Micheal strung the launcher across his back, switching to his &quot;Chupacobra&quot; Laser Pistol. That was always one of the conditions he liked to add in his contract. A very nicley sized free shopping spree in the faction he was working for's equipment, and sometimes ship dealer rooms. The Chupacobra was just one of the goodies he'd found. He cautionsly inspected the rubble. He had to get to the Commodity dealer and get as much scrap metal as possible. The Corsairs needed it for some new class of ship they were building, that was all. Getting to the room in the station seemed unlikely, the main corridor blocked. They had probably already posted guards on all decks. He'd have to do this the hard way. He turned around and enterened his ship thru the airlock. He powered up the Legionarre's systems. The docking doors wouldnt open, they thought he was trying to escape. He locked on one of his Angelitos and pulled the trigger. The bay totally decompressed and he flew out. &quot;Computer bring up the Hegoland Station Floorplans in three-dimensional view from external viewing.&quot; He ordered. &quot;Working.&quot; The computer calmly responded. A three-D holo-image appeared on in front of him. &quot;Computer highlight Commodity Dealer Storage area.&quot; A section of the station turned red on its outlined floorplan. He set in a mini Waypoint for that spot. He brought his CannonBall Missles online. The station powered up. He'd have 5 seconds before they fired and he died. He locked on the waypoint. 4 He checked his loaded the launcher. 3 He fired. 2 BOOM! 1 he tractored in the Commodities availible. 0. He hit cruise for the trade lane. ZOOM! ZOOM! ZOOM!The stations defenses went online. He dropped a mine and entered the tradelane. The Lane blew up behind him, but he was long gone. Half way thru he exited the lane and set course back for Corsair Space. He had done it, and he was 500k richer for it.</div>

<br />
<br />     Talon walked out of the bar grining, he had just been paid in something better then 100k. A full hold of Cardamine was in his hold. And he was leaveing for manhatten to sell it. He knew it was a deadly route but it paided off big time, and he would have 2 dagger esxorts till he left the badlands.
<br />
<br />      One hour later Talon was leaving the badlands for west point and then on to manhatten via the Trade lanes. He quickly hecked the lane he was in and over rided the safty systems witch allowed people to shut them down. He couldint be stoped now.
<br />
<br />      Yet another hour later he was landing on manhatten and selling his cargo. He was geting rich now, but he had a few runs to make before he could openly join the heckers.

<br />&quot;This is Corsairs, Green 15, Drop your cargo or die&quot;
<br />
<br />Tyler leaned back as he finished sending the message. in a few seconds the Dagger would drop it's cargo. If it didn't him and his wingmate would open fire and take what they needed by force. Then again, if the dagger did do what they wanted, they would open fire anyways.
<br />
<br />Tylers computer beeped. it had finished the scan. The Dagger was full of drinks and some odds and ends. Tylers face twisted into a wicked smile. Those drinks would sell well at Leon and Crete. The pilot would be sleeping on an asteroid tonight.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;This is not good.&quot; Jack said to himself. His mind raced, he needed time to think something up. What was going on here though? Othatie Coalition ships attacking a vessel under lane hacker call signs? No way. But way, there were two greedy Centurions in front of him. And they werent here for a tea party. Inspiration stuck. Jack opened the comm, a soft beep sounded, signalling he was transmitting. &quot;This is Lane Hacker, Jack Sedlejeck, of the Tri Allliance. I will turn over my cargo immediatly. I dont fancy going before my time. Prepare to tractor the cargo.&quot; Jack closed the comm quickly, and set to work, stepping into the back of his ship. He grabbed a wrench from a nearby work stand, and tore off a panel in the back of his ship. He ejected part of the durasteel plating, exposing a light blue, glowing auxillary power unit. He rolled up his sleeve, exposing his Synthetic arm, made of Isotonium. A non conductant material. He picked up the wrench with the man-made arm, grafted for him off the black market after he had a disagrement with a protective land mine on a raid on A houston LPI weapons depot. He slammed the wrench into the Aides of the Power cell, ripping it out. Huge volts were trying to shoot thru that arm, but he felt nothing. Nothing at all. He stuck the power cell with a piece of gold. And put it in the jettison airlock. He attached a energy jolter feedback device to it, and ran to the front of his ship. He sealed the Airlock, jettisoning the peice of gold. He was gambling. If that Corsair noticed that wasnt all he had in his hold..... . He got lucky. The corsairs wingman activated it. Jack slammed down on the emergency Distress responder and the feedback energy release. A blinding white shimmer shot back on the Corsair's wingman's tractor beam. The lightning engulfed his ship, destroying it. Jack engine kill turned his ship around, hitting Cruise as fast as possible, and letting loose his counter measures, and succesfully esacaping back to Mactan. But if what had just happened wasnt a dream, The Tri Alliance just went to war with the Othattie Coalition.

<br />&quot;I'll be sleeping on an asteroid tonight&quot;. Tyler allowed himself a rueful grin as he realized that his wish had come true. Not only had he been demoted, but his idiot of a wingman had cost him his ship and a promotion. Lastly, he was under investigation for starting a war between the Tri Alliance and the Ohalite Alliance. Now he was in a cell, awaiting a hearing for his &quot;crimes&quot;. &quot;If I can pin this on that idiot wingman, i'll be back in my Centurion before I know it&quot;, muttered Tyler. The pig of a guard in front of his cell turned and shouted at him to be quiet. Then, hearing a transmission from his collar transmitter, the guard turned and shot Tyler with a dart. Before Tyler sccumbed to unconciousness, he heard the guard say, &quot;Nighty night, you filthy criminal&quot;.

			<div class="content">Jack Sedgwick/Lane Hackers/Tri Alliance/Mactan Base/Dagger/600credits
<br />
<br />Jack  sipped the coffee that sat in front oh him, and quickly regretted it.  The Tri-Alliance's Mactan Base Command might have be good men, but they sure as heck needed better coffee. Jack looked around the somewhat spartan Conference room. Around him sat some of the most prominent figures in this part of Tri-Alliance space. Marco Chavez sat at the head of the table, breathing lightly through the dark cardamine mask covering his face. The buff, dark skinned Latino set his hands on the table and began to speak. &quot;Alright, let's get down to buisness. The man sitting in front of you all, is Jack Sedgwick. He's the one who encountered the Othatie Alliance ship in Maggellan. It seems that theve been extending there reach farther out of Bretonia. Including into Cortez, and the Tau's.&quot; his Spanish accented voice boomed throughout the room, making him seem larger than life, God like even. Not a wonder, Jack thought. This man is the King of Cardamine in Liberty and the surrounding border worlds. &quot;Yea, yea yea.&quot; Nick Browlsky, a thin man in charge of the Liberty Rouge contingents in The Liberty/Bretonia Border Worlds spoke up, his thick New Brooklynder accent cut into the room like a chainsaw on a stick of butter. &quot;You people can babble poltics and foreign policy all yall wish.&quot; he spat on the floor. &quot;But if you want my opinion, we soak em'. Push them out of our space right now.&quot;  &quot;Doing that without any preemptive knowledge would be foolish Senior Browlsky. If we do that, we would face a war with them on 3 fronts. Bretonia, The Liberty Rheinland/Border worlds, where their Red Hessian allies could move upward, sweeping towards Liberty. They could pour into our space here from Bretonia, not to mention attack Malta and Ruiz directly with devsating results for us, considering their superiour firepower and new Red Hessian Allies. They could blockade us up in Omicron Alpha, cutting off the Maltarian Syndicate.&quot;  Bwrowlsky slammed his fist down on the table. &quot;Your point? So what if they blockade you, youve held your own up there for centuries, but maybe thats not the case now. You seem aphrehensive at fighting. Your a coward arent you! Its that cardamine mask! Its chocking off your noggin'!&quot; &quot;You naive el la Stupido!&quot; Chavez raised his voice. Jack uncounsiously scooted his chair back, sensing something really bad was about to happen. He knew this was an uneasy alliance with the Outcasts and Liberty Rouges, but he had a bad feeling this was about to get ugly. &quot;You know nothing Stupido! We are outnumbered by the Hessian's by the Corsairs and their Hessian allies two to one! If Malta falls, you fall! Where do you think your funding comes from? Your ship's engineers? Your precious cardamine! Without us you are nothing!&quot; He screamed. Davey Cohen, leader of Mactan base, shifted visibly in his chair, but remained silent, his eyes darting back and forth like a dog watching a tennis game between the two arguing criminals. &quot;Ive had enough of this!&quot; Browlsky shot out of his chair, and overturned the table. Yup, Jack thought, its gunna get ugly. Chavez cursed whole-heartedly in Spanish, and sucker punched Browlsky. Browlsky didnt take this lightly, and decked Chavez, pummeling him into a wall. Cohen was dumbfounded, his lips moved, but no words came out. Jack sighed, and picked up his coffee cup, which had luckily not been on the table at the its time of demise. He sipped it, and swalllowed hard. Im going to need a lot more than coffee to get through tonite, he thought, watching the proceedings with much intrest. Chaves headbutted Browlsky in the face, stunning the New Brookylnder. Chavez  let out a cry of rage, and went on the offensive, pinning the Rouge to the ground, his superiour weight kept him down. Cohen decided if he couldnt speak well, he would let his actions work. He stood up, and walked over to the equally unsure what to do guards. He nodded to one of them. He handed him his Needler Rifle. Cohen walked over to the two struggling men. He cocked the needler rifle, the sound echoing throughout the room. &quot;Sit down!&quot; he managed to say. &quot;And stop acting like children! We are allies, not enemies you fools!&quot; Both fighting men looked up.  Chavez didnt like being ordered around by a thin-faced Libertarian. He punched Browlsky in the nose, buying himself time, and then charged like an angry  bull at Cohen. Cohen panicked, screaming for his life like a little girl, and fired the weapon wildly. Tat! tat! tat! tat! The weapon spurted. Cohen seemed to hit everything in the room but Chavez. Chavez ripped the weapon from his hands. This was ridiculous. Jack thought, unholstering his Lane Hacker LimeLight Magum, setting it for wide-spread stun. He pulled the trigger. The fighting men fell. Well, nice job Jack, he thought to himself. Youve just put yourself on trial for treason, mutiny, assault. But a thought came to him. The men who were lying uncounsious in front him, were the only ones who could trial him... Jack got an idea....
