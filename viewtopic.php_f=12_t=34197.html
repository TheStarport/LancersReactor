			<div class="content">So I get married in 9 days.  Groovy.
<br />
<br />But before I do, I believe its my duty to inform you of the scam that has now become the UK's Wedding Industry.  Its something I've been annoyed at for almost a year now, and now seems like the correct time to rant (I can get away with it because everyone can put it down to &quot;last minute nerves&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).
<br />
<br />Its not weddings that gives couples the nerves - its the thousands and thousands of pounds that is forked out for 1 day and the sheer weight of organisation that goes into the whole thing.  And the funny thing is - people just don't notice.  I don't understand why we are bothering - I simply don't get it.  When I've been to weddings in the past, I've come away thinking &quot;oh such and such was nice&quot; or &quot;that thingy was a nice touch&quot;....but if I'd known the pain the couple must have gone through and the sheer extent of the debt they will have put themselves in, just so I could say &quot;oh that was nice&quot; I really would have told them not to bother.
<br />
<br />But thats not the way it works unfortunately.  No no no.  This day and age, a wedding isn't a celebration of the unity of two people who love each other.  Its one enormous commercial money making scheme.  You don't realise until you go through it, just how many people out there have made themselves stinking rich from selling &quot;wedding balloons&quot;, &quot;wedding cake&quot;, &quot;wedding shoes&quot; or something equally menial and pathetic.
<br />
<br />But the way it works is simple, its like one large money grabbing chain....follow me...You decide you're going to have a meal for 60 after your wedding, so you visit a couple of venues who tell you that its going to cost &#163;x,000 to hire the venue and the somewhere between &#163;40 and &#163;90 per person per meal....you instantly think, hang on, how much??!!  So you shop around for a caterer who will charge somewhere between &#163;20 and &#163;60 per person per meal, which although only marginally different, over 60 people could save you a fortune.
<br />
<br />So you approach your favourite venue about using the caterer and they say &quot;not unless you are going to use a marquee, no external caterers INSIDE the building&quot;.  So you enquire about a marquee, and the venue says it can be arranged for &#163;xx,000.  Wow! you think.  Thats a lot of dosh, let me see if I can get a cheaper marquee.  So you shop around and find a cheaper marquee and reapproach the venue.  The venue then tells you &quot;thats fine by us, however we will be charging you for use of the land - which is &#163;x,000&quot;.  By now, you've spent well into 5 figures.
<br />
<br />Then the caterer recommends a wedding cake maker.  Who in turn recommends a cutlery provider, who recommends a tableware (glasses, plates etc) provider, who recommends a table provider, who recommends a printer that can do your table plan and table numbers, who recommend the people who can lay a floor in your marquee, who recommend a stage builder, who recommend a band, who recommend a lighting specialist to illuminate your currently pitch black marquee.
<br />
<br />Ouch.
<br />
<br />So you've got your venue, your caterer, your tables, your plates, glasses and cutlery, a dancefloor, a mini stage, some lighting and a band.  You have a table plan, table numbers, table cloths and a wedding cake.  But it all looks a bit drab, so you consider table decor....a florist.  You find a florist who gleefully rubs her hands together and begins to inform you that its the &quot;done thing&quot; to put flowers on the tables and around the marquee, inside and outside of your church (in fact, the vicar expects it!)....not to mention the bride's bouquet, the groom's button hole, the father's button holes, the best man's button hole, the usher's button hole, the elder bridesmaid's corsage, the bouqet's for the younger bridesmaids and of course a Prayer Book for the page boy.  ****!!!!
<br />
<br />Then we move onto clothes.  The wedding dress of course, well, they're mostly tailor made nowadays...luckily men aren't so fussy so we just hire the wedding suits.  The bridesmaids get tailor made dresses and of course (these are women after all) they all get matching shoes.
<br />
<br />I'm not even half done here...!!...but I really am not going to bore you any more with the finer elements of details (invites, order of services, rsvps, outdoor seating and heating, toilets etc etc etc *yawn*)....but there's one last thing I want to rant about....CORKAGE.
<br />
<br />Corkage, the bane of every married couple, the joy of every venue owner.  In a dictionary, Corkage should read &quot;when a venue screws you for ridiculous amounts of cash because he can&quot;.
<br />
<br />For those of you not familiar with term &quot;corkage&quot;....this is when you get charged because you decided to provide your own alcohol for your party.  Hire a marquee, put it in the grounds of a nice stately home (which doesn't have a bar), insert a small bar in the corner of the marquee to provide your guests with drinks.  The venue will then charge you upwards of &#163;10 per bottle for every bottle of wine OPENED.  &#163;2+ for every pint poured and anywhere upwards of &#163;20 per bottle of spirits that are OPENED.  At a wedding of say 100 guests, your Corkage bill alone (not including the price of the alcohol in the first place - and the guy you are getting to serve it)will be upwards of &#163;4000.  Thats &#163;4K+ for the PRIVILEGE of drinking in the grounds of your stately home.  What a ****ing rip off.  How do they get away with it?  Simple really - THEY ALL DO IT! In fact, there's even a price war going on with corkage....often the choice of venue is the one with lowest corkage rate because the one thing that your guests are guaranteed to do, is drink.
<br />
<br />So there ya go.  Welcome to wedding hell.  Yes I know it will be fine on the day.  Yes I know its all about &quot;the two of us&quot;.  YES YES I KNOW!! Its scary how many people have said that to me.  Yes yes yes yes yes, stop with the bull**** buzz phrases!! The fact of the matter is, this whole thing is ****ing ridiculous.  Put yourself in debt for 10 years for one day - a day that no one will care if the tables hold 8 or 10 people, or if the lighting is dead centre, or if the stage is exactly 14&quot; high - no-one cares!!!  Its ridiculous.  I want to marry the girl I love, not line scam-artist's pockets with gold.
<br />
<br />So next time you get invited to a wedding, bare in mind what I've just told you.  Consider what the bride and groom are REALLY going through.  They're not nervous about marrying each other....they're nervous that everything they've organised and paid for could go wrong in a split second.  And if you're thinking of getting married?  Do it small, do it quick and do it romantically.  There's nothing romantic about the industry known as &quot;weddings&quot; believe me.
<br />
<br />Anyone share my rant or are my words falling on deaf ears?</div>

			<div class="content">I can completly understand where you are coming from on this Grom. My cousin got married 2 weeks ago and the entire day cost just under &#163;10000. And that was supposed to be cheap<img src=smilies/icon_smile_shock.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. You are right though, it is an absoulote scam to get married and have a big wedding day.
<br />
<br />And congratulations btw<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />EDIT: Over 22 grand!!!<img src=smilies/icon_smile_shock.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />Are you getting married in a hotel or something or are you doing a church wedding? 
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: Why did you not put a certain amount behind the bar and make guests pay for it? It may sound cheap but thats what my cousin did. The had 1 bottle of wine per table, if you wanted more, you had to pay for it.

<br />
<br />Yep its costing UPWARDS of &#163;22K, I don't want to disclose the actual amount.  Its a church wedding with a bog-standard marquee reception. We've managed to cut out a lot of the more expensive &quot;so called traditional&quot; bits, but we have 150 people coming so the bar bill alone will be well over &#163;10,000 (WELL over).</div>

			<div class="content">Well, first off...
<br />
<br />Congrats Grom! Glad you are joining the club, I got married 3 weeks ago.
<br />
<br />  I think that we were lucky in that we didn't spend much but LDS weddings are hardly ever expensive.  I think her mother said it all cost about $5,200 with travel, lodging, catering, and photographers at 2 locations.  Thankfully the wife and I didn't have to shell out but about $1,500 of it.  I have pictures if anyone wants to see.  I'll post it in a new thread.
<br />
<br />&quot;On this ship you are to refer to me as Idiot, not you Captain.  I mean... you know what I mean.&quot;

			<div class="content">@bret - lol <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> don't forget to spring for a coffee for the bum too - its only fair - proper italian though, none of this starbucksy stuff <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  To be fair, it was actually my future father-in-law who wanted to pay for everyone's drinks - so he is.  I disagreed, but we agreed that we would offer free drink all around as long as HE foots the bill.
<br />
<br />@FD - depends on what the 2 of us want?! lol. yeah right <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  We wanted a small religious ceremony and then to jump straight on a plane and leave.  The unfortunate truth of the matter is that its not what WE want, its what our FAMILYs want.  Hence the 150 people - 3/4 of which I've never met in my life.  Thats the disadvantage of wanting to please your family.  The other thing thats driven the price up is the fact we wanted a church ceremony.  Over here the cost of a church ceremony is almost 10 times that of a registry office.
<br />
<br />@topher - CONGRATS!!! <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I'm so impressed with how cheaply you did the whole thing, how many people came to see you?

We did the finger food instead of the sit down meal at the reception so that people could come and go as they pleased, and it also saved us some money.  The next morning we had a brunch for all the family that made the trek to Tennessee from Florida and Indiana.  We used the same caterer for the brunch and the reception and got a cheaper deal for the brunch.

			<div class="content">Some words by a man who never has been or will be married (though he has a son); you might not like some of them; excuses in advance, no offense intended.
<br />
<br />Nobody MUST spend 20'000 &#163; for his/her wedding day if he/she does not accept the social rules/pressure/obligations to join &quot;traditions&quot;. Of course if someone want his marriage to be a social event (in the familiy/village/region/enterprise etc.) - and there are many good reasons to do so -, then it will be expensive (Being part of the establishment ... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> . That's why there are traditions in many countries and cultures why the father-in-law, the husbands family or other people pay the bill or part of it. And this social aspect (call it 'IMAGE') allows the wedding industry to suck your bucks off.
<br />
<br />In my country (Switzerland; one of the richest countries) young(er) people have established a new tradition to escape to this financial trap:
<br />They declare their intention to organise a non-traditional wedding day and to break with social rules and traditions. All guests know it and accept less luxury food, drinks and accomodation; nobody MUST come if they don't agree or don't like it. So this way of celebtrating a wedding day is now fairly accepted.
<br />As a compensation the newly wed couple OR THE GUESTS donate for a social institution (Red Cross, Greenpeace etc.) and they say publicly how much.
<br />
<br />But of course a lot of the people here do not resist to the social pressure and spend crazy lots of money for &quot;the most WONDERFUL day&quot; of their life that means in our materialistic world: the most EXPENSIVE day of your lifetime.
<br />
<br />Anyway: congratulations, grom, and all the best for your future.
<br />
<br />PS: It was not for financial reasons why I do not want to get married ...

			<div class="content">Yes kimk.  To have a church wedding you do have to be a christian.  Hehe, why the confusion?  Can I not be a christian if I'm a beer swilling, swearing, loud mouthed, over-opinionated stoner? <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Hehehe, I can't comment further or else I'd be breaking the TLR religion rules....so lets just say that my gf is Polish Catholic and the Vicar was happy with my answers.  Thanks for the congrats <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />@zazie - You're absolutely right, you shouldn't have to spend that much cash on a wedding.  But the day will be a more of a &quot;family reunion&quot; than a day for us, hence why I resent it a little.  However, I love my family and therefore am committed to the day.  Hope that makes sense.  Thanks for the congrats <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I don't think the whole grand scale of a wedding is that important to the groom, usually.  After all, he's what, the third or fourth most important person there (After the bride, parents, and others).  It's the brides day to shine, and many young girls grow up fantacising about their weddings (not all, I'm making several generalizations).  Is is a lot of money, yes, but for most its well worth it.  These women get to live out their dreams, the families become re-united and introduced to each other, and the groom gets to be with the woman he loves for the rest of his life.  A real bargain at 20,000 if you think about it. --- VH16
