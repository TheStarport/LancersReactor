			<div class="content">Six different life forms populate the game world of Darkstar One. 
<br />The calamitously unstable peace between the races is frequently disrupted by quarrels and conflicts. The different ideologies of the races constantly cause skirmishes at the borders, espionage and disruptions. While traveling through space the player will always find ample opportunities to take advantage of these conflicts. His increasing demand for better weapons and equipment must be funded somehow after all. Not only the design of the spaceships and the space stations varies greatly; the fighting strategies and the individually developed weaponry of the races are completely different. 
<br />
<br />
<br />TERRANS
<br /><img src='http://darkstarone.ascaron.com/gb/gb_darkstarone/gameinfo/pics/symbole_die_rassen_terraner.gif'>
<br />
<br />The Terrans prefer forward facing weapons and missiles and they usually attempt to keep the player within their cone of fire. The Terrans prefer a design with classical shapes and neutral colors. 
<br />
<br />The Terrans
<br />Humankind originated from Earth and throughout history continued to spread out to settle new systems. Initially, they achieved their migration through peaceful means such as inter-racial trading and the colonizing of uninhabited planets. However, as the Terran expansion continued, the peaceful negotiations were gradually replaced by war and subterfuge. During their years on Earth, Humans had always regarded themselves as being the crown of creation and they carried forth this attitude into deep space. 
<br />
<br />Different mentalities established separate groups within the Terrans. The largest group was founded and led by Dr. Samantha Thul. She advocated uncontrolled genetic manipulation, cloning experiments and the utilization of nano-technology in order to improve the human body and soul. Attempts to prevent those experiments were fruitless. After many disputes and conflicts, millions of Thul followers left the Terran systems before locating and settling a new cluster. 
<br />
<br />As a result, they became involved in many conflicts with the Arrack, Raptor, Oc'to and the Mortok races. Eventually, these conflicts culminated in a terrible galactic war. Up until the present day, historians are discordant as to who won the war - the only fact they agree upon is that the Terrans were not victorious. 
<br />
<br />The vast empire of the Terrans was shattered during the battles which ensued. Humankind withdrew into their core systems and began the arduous task of rebuilding. However, while the other races were still arguing over their new borders, the Humans sent out diplomats in order to promote a galactic union. As the shock of war was still all too apparent within the minds of the other races, the efforts of the Human diplomats were fruitful. The six great nations of the galaxy (Terran, Arrack, Raptor, Thul, Oc'to and Mortok) joined the Galactic Union. They agreed to appoint a democratically elected council in order to represent the Union and handle its affairs. Despite the seemingly amicable atmosphere, the extra-terrestrial races knew that the good intentions of the Terrans were born from selfishness and fear. Terran technologies were far behind those of neighboring races, their economy was virtually destroyed and, had the war continued, the Terran Empire would have struggled to prosper. Yet, these facts did not temper the Terran arrogance, nor prevent their demand to the first presidency of the Council. Furthermore, they threatened all races who did not join the Union with sanctions to be enforced by patrols and military warships - warships which they did not even have at their disposal. 
<br />
<br />&quot;We will bring you peace&quot; said the legendary First President of the Council, Harry R. Coulbert, in his inaugural speech, &quot;even if we must pound it into you.&quot; 
<br />
<br />To date, only the Terrans' closest relatives, the Thul, were expelled from the Union by the council. Due to their unethical and dangerous experiments they were forced to leave the Union. They withdrew and vanished without a trace. Since then, there has been no official contact with this race. Despite these events, historians generally concur that the founding of the Galactic Union prevented further outbreaks of war so far. Agreement is also widespread that prominent internal discrepancies will tear the Council apart. Such an event would have disastrous repercussions for Humankind - possibly even for the entire galaxy.
<br />
<br />
<br />MORTOK
<br /><img src='http://darkstarone.ascaron.com/gb/gb_darkstarone/gameinfo/pics/symbole_die_rassen_mortok.gif'>
<br />
<br />The Mortok do not use bow weapons. Instead, they boast turrets, which are able to fire in any direction. When the Mortok are pursued, they are able to employ a sudden reverse thrust, which will enable them to withdraw from the opponent's cone of fire.
<br />The Mortok like bulky and rounded shapes. Their ships are heavily armored and therefore, they are not very agile. 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />The Mortok 
<br />Mor, home planet of the Mortok, is a world filled with extremes. Large volcanoes, roaring storms and scorching heat dominate the side of the planet that faces the sun; frozen oceans and eternal night rule on the other side. The Mortok's genesis claims that the God Xorom chose this world in order to test the strength of the people whom he had created. Alas, the result was not as he had anticipated: Xorom's people climbed the towering mountain of which he resided and killed him. 
<br />
<br />The history of the Mortok is as martial as its origin that lies in this legend. The inhabitants of the light and the dark sides of the planet were at war with each other for millennia, fighting over a small band of land that was situated between the two zones. This area was fertile and the climate was bearable. The ongoing war influenced the technology and the society of the Mortok who were divided into clans. Gunpowder and fire arms were invented long before any written language was developed. The Mortok also established a complex code of honor that defined the conduct of the Mortok in dealings with both comrades and enemies. 
<br />
<br />When they began to venture into space the conflict on the twilight planet finally subsided as a galaxy full of new worlds opened up before them. Soon they encountered other races during their explorations: first the eloquent Raptor, then the timid Arrack. The warring nature of the Mortok clans resulted in wars against these new races. However, the Mortok soon learned that their uncoordinated groups of warriors, who often harbored hostility towards each other, could not stand their ground against the Raptor. Even though the Raptor forces were disorganized and chaotic, the Mortok were hopelessly outnumbered and doomed to an overwhelming defeat. The lizard people conducted a devastating campaign, culminating in the occupation of Mor. 
<br />
<br />The Raptor began to exploit the planet: resources were depleted, the inhabitants were enslaved. The Mortok realized that their only chance to shake off their oppressors was to stand united. Fifty years passed before the charismatic mine worker Avarro succeeded in uniting the clans. He was the leader of a mine worker rebellion that fueled the fire of a world-wide uprising. Avarro united the clans behind him. They expelled the Raptor from the entire cluster and formed a planet-wide government under Avarro as leader of all clans. Under his leadership peace treaties were signed with the Raptor and the Arrack, and commerce agreements were negotiated and finalized with the Terrans and the Oc't</div>
