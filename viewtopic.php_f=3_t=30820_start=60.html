			<div class="content">Not necessarily. Ships of course would probably be maxable, but if you could build things, hire people, start factions, own multiple ships and so forth... Also, if there were made a little more like an RPG, and had actual pilot skills, there's no reason why you couldn't keep going forever.
<br />And as for experienced players having an advantage over inexperienced players, how is that unlike many other popular games? Freelancer as it is quickly becomes boring once you have the best ships and the best weapons (which isn't hard). There needs to be more to do once you get to that point.</div>

			<div class="content">Microsoft was onto something when they made this game.  But what everyone knows its lacking is some sort of F.P.S. quality!  Imagine landing on a planet and actually having to walk to an equipment dealer!  And since its a F.P.S., weapons dealers sell MANY MANY MANY varieties of weapons.  If someone wants to start something with you on the street, draw those awesome laser pistols Trent has in the SP campaign.  
<br />
<br />Even in space there should be a F.P.S. quality.  Greatly improve the cockpits so that people WANT to use the cockpit viewpoint, and if you want to, enable autopilot then get up from the pilot's chair and walk around inside your spacecraft.  Now there's not many places to goto if you're in a small fighter, but on turreted ships you could have to run to the turrets if you want to use them manually. (Kinda like StarWars Episode IV).  You can have a weapons locker in your spacecraft and other places to keep stuff you've found.  You can enter the cargo hold and see what you're spending all those credits on.  And, when you land planetside, (you have to do the landing yourself finally), open the hatch, walk outside, and get your speeder out of the cargo bay to make the trip into town to buy equipment.
<br />
<br />Sounds somewhat like vice city but look how well that game did.  I've always thought Freelancer looked half finished, like the developers wanted to do so much more with the game.  Well if they use even half of the ideas expressed in this forum, wow...
<br />
<br />Another idea:  Your spacecraft can be captured!  Then you have to fight the pirates off inside your spacecraft!  Any copilots or turret gunners you've hired break out their weapons and help you!  The pirates blast through your hatch, and if you're really good you can walk right through your hatch and start blasting the pirates on their own ships.  (What does the inside of a nomad ship look like I wonder?)  
<br />
<br />If only Microsoft would listen to this stuff...
<br />
<br />Lemme know what you think.
<br />
<br />If only Halo's FPS properties could be combined with an improved Freelancer-type gameplay, all hell would break loose...   But then again instead of playing these games until 1 A.M. I would just never sleep.</div>

			<div class="content">If they never make a sequel to Freelancer, it would be a shame. There is an absolutely massive amount of story content in this game that could be expanded upon. I mean, this game deserves a sequel, despite its shortcomings. There are plenty of games around that were never mainstream, were poorly put together, and overall weren't even 1/2 as good as Freelancer, not even close, yet they have sequels. I tell you, it's unjust.
<br />And I want to know what the hell those guys at Digital Anvil are doing.
<br />
<br />Seeing as this is an ideas thread... 
<br />To create a game that was more organic and lifelike, i.e. one where the planets actually move, and orbit the sun (even if the change is negligible over the course of the game, so as to promote realism), perhaps you could replace the current tradelanes with trade beacons. 
<br />In practice, the trade beacon would function almost exactly like the tradelane, but it would allow for them to move through the system without screwing up travel. The idea for a lane beacon is that it warps the space around it, allowing properly equipped ships to enter the accelerated state that allows faster travel between points. With this method though, the lane could curve around obstacles, instead of having them all go in a straight line. Also, if you only had to be in the vicinity of the beacon instead of going through it, it might make docking a little easier.</div>

			<div class="content">HI
<br />One idea for the story line is that the Alliance-Coalion battle never ended.  Its been 4 months and for all thair talk the pirate factions havent done anything and the order has become rather bored waiting for the Nomads. Trent is aproched by a guy offering a huge pay if he leads a possibly dangeres expadition. He accepts and when he makes it there he finds himself in the middle of a huge fight between 2 battleships that dont look like anything built before yet still human. Suddenly a fighter decloaks behind him but his to quick and he destroys it and the expadition force enters the fray. After the battle he sends some ships back for reinfocements and then he docks with the surviving battleship. The man in control reveals the ships name to be the Yamato and then asks if he can go to seek refuge in the Sirius sector. In the end a huge Alliance convey retreats trough the jump hole. A man called Klaus Stiener tells Trent whats happening but gets interrupted when a message cames though. &quot;Trent this is Juni im leading the reinforcements. We have detectid a number of unidenterfide ships moving in.&quot; And so begins the second Coalition war.

			<div class="content">Having played most games in this genre, im happy to see the freelance community still live and kicking .
<br />Having looked down this extencive list,I would like to add a couple of suggestions to the list of great ideas ,1 it would be nice to own muiltiple ships . 1 for fighting , 1 for genral use , 1 for cargo ect . 
<br />2  also be kewl to see battle damage on the ship, but wont do anything for game play.
<br />3 Be kewl to see systems were out after X amount of use , guns engines , and when they do you can either have the option of getting the repaird or selling them to a 2nd hand dealer , where from the start of the game you can pick up cheap but worn out weps , engs , ect, maybe also sell whole ships.
<br />Well theres my ideas .
<br />Ps can somone please come by Titan and get me off planet 
<br />Well as we say on titan Stay Greedy</div>

<br />if you lose a wing, then your steering should go wonky
<br />and you should be able to lose life support and stuff
<br />and wouldnt actually being able to suffer a coolant leak be funny <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ? well, at least until you suffer one in a critical situation <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />if you lose coolant, perhaps thruster burn times decrease, or cruise engines cut out intermitently, or weapons have a lower refire rate - stuff like that
<br />it would add an interesting touch of realism a balance to the game, and one more thing to be careful of

			<div class="content">These are ideas that i have thought of for a long while:
<br />
<br />Firstly make a new kind of BattleShip that has weak weapons but other people can dock at it (kind of like the stopped battleships) you should pay like 10million for a ship that sells a bloodhound or basic ship and 100-200million for a ship selling maxed out kit and all good ships. also i think there shud be ALOT more ships not just the three good ships (eagle,sabre,titan) they get old after a bit of time make more ships that have key things that make 1 beat the other for example the eagle beats titan and titan beats sabre and sabre beats eagle although skill wud also be a factor.
<br />I think that adding sort of an XP system to the game would be good aswell currently the only good things u get is rank based holely on ship and cash what if you could shoot an NPC that was crap and got low XP and a good NPC and get high XP and the same for players (although people wud start dock rape harsh) i think aswell there shud be an end to dock rape like in old games u cnt kill for 5 seconds but ur shields become invincible until that time is up gives u time to prepare urself.
<br />an increased story line in MP so you can join a specific faction and work your way up there ranks and more ships become available (like slowly getting more outcast weapons and stuff).
<br />putting an end to totally neautral reps would be good aswell, to many people have good reps and just fly around untouched (myself included) and just shoot players and also if some1 is in an enemy faction you shouldnt be allowed to join group with them and they appear red to you, also NO trading unless you are either a Junker or Zoner (unless they put diferent NPC factions in) it would make the game alot better for roleplay.
<br />make the systems alot more advanced like asteroid fields that are almost impossible to pass through unless you kno how to and gas fields that really push your skill to the edge to get through them, and alot more options for bases for example being able to walk around the places to get to them in 3rd person.
<br />one thing i did find stupid in freelancer is how sometimes u sat at an enemy base for god knows how long and then 2 ships appear, they should dispatch a ton of ships to combat you etc.
<br />
<br />also add the barrel role to players it pwns <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Okay I bought Freelancer when it first came out and finished in in the first month...but I've been thinking about it lately...maybe I grow homesick for the Sirius sector again or something.
<br />
<br />Anyway, foresure Freelancer 2 needs to be made...and maybe an expansion or 2 for the original before FL2 comes out.
<br />
<br />Add...
<br />1) 3rd person...walk around planets, espionage missions against government buildings, ambush outside the bar, kidnap missions with hostage begging to be released, hand to hand combat, pick pocketing in the market area, bounty hunt for guy on a pleasure cruiser while he's in the pool, hit the Casino, take a vacation to a resort planet for a week (all work and no play...lol), explore the dark side of a small moon.  I'd also add external space combat in space suits (like in the Intro movie of Freelancer) like a space marine.
<br />
<br />2)True ship damage...guns shot up, out of missiles, engine won't fire...etc.  Add to this the above space combat in 3rd person, you could be dead in the water, so what do you do...you put on your space suit, grab your portable rail gun and head to the airlock and start defending the small piece of scrap metal you are floating on before you go up in a ball of fire!
<br />
<br />3) In atmosphere ship combat...fly across the surface of the planet, attack ground vehicles, buildings, other ships, compete in races (like star wars pod racing)  Land in underwater cities.
<br />
<br />4) More races, more cities on the planets...800 years have passed since your civilization got here so there should be a much larger population...ability to interact with the general populace too...
<br />
<br />5) A universe based on physics...every action has a reaction and an outcome...blow up a star and see what happens (large scale example but you get what I mean...)  Planets should move (tracked by onboard computer), new mining sites pop up, new bases/settlements built, space pollution, contruction projects at the ship yard actually get finished...political system in houses, elections, death of the king/queen, etc.  Keep the game evolving!!!
<br />
<br />6)Create your own customizable character, name, hair colour, cloths, gender, age, maybe species...and starting location.
<br />
<br />Well that's enough for now...fingers are crossed for FL2!!

<br />In Freelancer II there should be sub-quests, small mini-storylines that you can 'branch off at any time' on. There should be one for each faction and make it so that you don't get the full Freelancer story until you do each and every one of them. This would fulfill the promise that Freelancer had that it would be totally open ended which it quite frankly isn't. You need to atleast do the first couple of missions with the Liberty Navy since you HAVE NO SHIP so you have no choice. This is not open ended. The thing Freelancer II needs the most and should have before anything else is thought about is the ability to be totally open ended.

<br />Maybe thats what else they should put in: the chance to actually join factions.

			<div class="content">this is IG-2000
<br />i like the story hero <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> . 
<br />the Hispania is one big mysteri, what if someone build it agine, just this time it will be for warfare to take over Rhienland, Liberty an then the 2 how is left, dos not just giv up. 
<br />It was a surpris for Rhienland when this big ship shows up in the middle of Rhienland and blast The ring to pices and clock just show that the Hispania not as easyli forgotten and now its back, and now its pay back time!
<br />and why a there so angry? 
<br />becores; when it all whent wrong for the crew at the Hispania they send a HELP signal and the Rhienland was support ship (or something) for hispania  but the refust to help they need the restorse in that system so they send fighter and bombers out whit the help from Liberty who need the area so they send out lots af bombers and stuff like that but just as they need one system more they ran in to the old enemies the corlisen (or what ever it&#180;s name is) and the fight.
<br />after 4 years after the nomads story the ring gets blast up just the same way as freeport 7 did and trent hears about it and think NOMADS!!! he want to contakt The Order  but just when he fly out from manhatten the Hispania apers just right out for manhatten, and the rest i don know yet...
<br />just little Qusten why aint there black humans? 
<br />
<br />IG-2000 &quot; now you see my, now you don&#180;t and now your dead too bad&quot;</div>
