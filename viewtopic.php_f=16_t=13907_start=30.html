<br />1. The sleeper ships fired at the coalition forces destroying the ones that where in thier flight path.
<br />2. They were escoted by a number of fighters, but it does not show if they jumped as well. 
<br />3. I highly doubt it took hundreds of years to reach Sirius. The guy that left pluto reached Sirius as well and his is way, way to small to survive something that would take hundreds of years.
<br />4. The nomad ship destroyed everything. No more Alliance no more Coaltion.</div>

<br />my POV.. hey those sleeper ships are firing you know.. i think sleeper ships shold have at least minimal firing arcs on her front coz how the hell are you gonna get through a blockade without a forward firing arc? combined with 4 gigantic sleeper ships those arcs can rip any coalition Carriers into pieces but that doesnt mean they can win and fight pressing on to mars and earth.. no.. no. the fact is that those sleeperships are 2 or 3X larger than standard carriers or battle ships that makes psycological impact on the coalition forces and without sufficent reenforcements coming in time a few Carrier is not a match for sleeper ships... but then again some of the sleeper ships were destroyed right.. if you think about it.. how the hell can a fighter took down coalition carriers? unless she's a bomber sure but i dont see any bombers doing any runs coz the alliance ship defenting the orbit was quickly destroyed in the begining without time to launch bombers.

			<div class="content">Just for the record, NO sleeper was destroyed at all during the jump. Only five sleeper ships were launched; Bretonia, Rhineland, Kasari, Hisponia and the Liberty. All of them jumped, all of them made it to Sirus. It wasn't until after they reached Sirus that Hisponia was lost. I doubt very much the reason it exploded was because of coalision damage, either. In the video the only sleeper that appeared to have taken damage was the Liberty... though you don't see the others as directly, so they could have sustained minor damage as well.
<br />
<br />[Edit Oh, and Heretic. The Coalision may not have followed simply because they didn't care. Once the sleepers leave, the alliance is drasticly weakened, in only a moment of time I'm sure the Coalision successfully ended the war in victory. So now that the Coalision has Sol, why would they care what happened to those huge ships that did nothing but poke a hole in the blockade? Out of sight out of mind.
<br />
<br />And I take the last line &quot;But, we will never forget.&quot; to mean &quot;We will never forget what the war had done to us.&quot; as well ;p

<br />Pertaining to the original storyline what was suppose to happen was that we as the players were suppose to find out why the Nomads destroyed the Solar system &amp; with the help of the warp drive the player was also suppose to go back to the solar system.This was said in one of the early interviews with Chris Roberts himself.
<br />
<br />
<br />Now that the the Nomads haven't destroyed earth.You can be sure that either a sequel or expansion should cover that part of the storyline with either a rumour or something more.This might explain why some of the farther out systems are missing like Omega 13 &amp; some of the Tau systems since there might have been rumours pertaining to what happened to earth or what might be going on.Can't wait to see what happens,the skies the limit on what will happen but you can be sure the Nomads will always be involved.</div>

			<div class="content">Even if earth survived (and for the record, I think it did) I seriously doubt that the Coalition lasted. Don't forget that not only 800 years has passed since Starlancer, but however many years it took for the sleeper ships to arrive at Sirius (which could be anywhere from 1 - 100 years or more since it is never actually stated how long the journey took).
<br />And even if (on the outside chance) that the Coalition lasted as a government for 800 or more years I really doubt that it would be anything like the Coalition of SL. Policies change, people change...revolutions happen. Plus, don't forget that the Sleeper ships escaped the Coalition, with a govenment as nasty as they were they would probably keep that bit of info quiet and just say that they destroyed all of the Alliance...after 800+ years they would have probably forgot all about the Sleeper ships!
<br />
<br />Oh and going back to the original intro, the answer to the question 'why would the Nomads just appear and blow up the sun?' Consider the fact that Humanity had been at war with itself for 100 years. Would you honestly want this warlike race to figure out how to get out of its home system and tear-arse across the galaxy?? Or would you think; 'Ah, stuff it, let's just blow up there sun and have done with them!'

			<div class="content">Did u notice in the &quot;cut&quot; intro u see a ship flying to the planet where the sleeper ship stands? The game designers forgot to edit that part... OOPS! :O And Zero-nt-...There were 8 launched. 3 were destroyed before they jumped and 5 made it to hyper space. The hispania had a colation sabautour on board. U can go see the Hispania in Omicron Alpha in sector 6D by planet malta. And Rheinland Destroyer's Right. If u fly to the unknown jumphole in omicron alpha there is a REALLY weird star. Maybe this is whats supposed to be left of Sol.

			<div class="content">Its almost certain that Sol is still going, in the intro the coalition had won the war more or less anyway, they were just finishing the job by destroying the bases around jupiter. After the sleeper ships left the coalition would have wiped out the remainder of the Alliance. 
<br />
<br />Early on in the game i though that all the exploding ships / stations / people etc were down to the coalition who had finally recoverd after 100 years of war, rebuilt and were strong enough to come after the last remnants of the alliance. After that i realised most the 'badies' had hispanic names (outcasts corsairs) so then thought that maybe on of the other ships had fired on the hispania to give themselves a better chance. Then the nomads revealed themselves and i realised i was wrong.
<br />
<br />When the sequal is released i'm certain that the coalition will feature, it'd be foolish not to use them really. A few little theorys of how the coalition could feature:
<br />
<br />1) The journy to sirius took far longer than anyone realised (clocks, computers etc screwed up and stopped / slowed) and while the ships travaled the vast distance of space the coalition grew strong, build up a vast empire etc. Then they buggered off somewhere and left their guardians to take care of the place (coalition = dom kavosh (or whatever)
<br />
<br />2) The nomads, pissed at loosing in sirius go after Sol (origional intro) but a load of coalition make it out alive and flee to sirius where after a bit of fighting they join forces to defeat the nomads again.
<br />
<br />3) Coalition launches a full scale invasion of sirius (or sirius invades sol)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />As a side note, why didn't the people on the hispania ask for help from the other houses? even if they got there years behind the others i'm sure they would have helped them, instead they suddenly turn into bloodthursty banditos?</div>

<br />Well, the Outcasts (a bunch of drug-addicts who have evolved to a new species of human due to 800 years of Cardamine addiction(for those who weren't paying attention) blame the Alliance Houses for abandoning them (if not being in collusion with the Coalition sabateur). There eventual long-term goal appears to be to get all of Sirius addicted to Cardamine, so they can just take over.
<br />
<br />The Corsairs (if you read the news bulletins) just want to conquer the Border worlds (short-term) and then see what happens.

			<div class="content">My theory on why the Coalition did not pursue the Alliance:
<br />
<br />Obviously, their enemy is running away, and for a very very very very long time. The Coalition, therefore, now has a long period of time during which they can:
<br />
<br />1. Clean up any remaining Alliance forces in-system(such as those who were left behind when the sleepers launched).
<br />
<br />2. Assess their losses, bury their dead.
<br />
<br />3. Salvage the numerous shipwrecks lying all over Sol after 100 years of war.
<br />
<br />4. Repair the ships they had left, along with their bases and any other facilities.
<br />
<br />5. Re-populate any territories vacated by retreating Alliance forces.
<br />
<br />6. Consolidate their power over the Sol system, building new outposts, border stations, establishing a capitol and a system of government for peacetime.
<br />
<br />7. Explore any undiscovered territories.
<br />
<br />The Coalition had much better things to do at the time. They more than likely could not support a huge expeditionary force to go and retrieve the colony ships. And they probably didn't even care by that point; a group of sleeper ships running away at top speed is a sure sign that the enemy was not about to mount any significant offensives against them. Eventually, they may have sent probes to Sirius, and found that all the former Alliance nations were fighting each other. Then they would have had a good chuckle, now being absolutely sure that the &quot;Alliance&quot; wasn't going to come home any time within the next few millenia, and would probably wipe itself out before any Coalition fleet could get there.
<br />
<br />Reaper: $200,000,000. 
<br />Rockets: $100,000
<br />The look on that pilot's face when you launch a full pod of screamers up his tailpipe: priceless</div>

<br />
<br />Well, as the rumour which suggests there are 8 sleeper ships also suggests they left from PLUTO (the intro clearly shows the Coalition forces advancing on the JUPITER SYSTEM (by system I assume it means its moons) after taking Mars), I really don't think anyone should read too much into it. The sleeper ships left from one of the moons of Jupiter; Jupiter was in the background for heaven's sake. There are only two possibilities:
<br />1. The guy who said it (who for me wasn't the bartender) was doped-up on Cardamine, bladdered beyond reason, or simply wrong.
<br />2. The rumour is a remnant from the old storyline which they forgot to change.
<br />
<br />But its not going to be true. A 'rumour' is just that, and as the facts far outweigh the rumour, I don't see why it should suddenly be accepted as pure, hard evidence. 
<br />
<br />Anyway, if the developers chose not to show Sol destroyed, its safest to assume they didn't have it destroyed. As I said before, doing so may limit any plans they may have for an add-on/sequel. Again, if a movie radically alters its script, no-one just sticks with the original because they like it better. They watch and accept the new script. I don't see why it should be any different with a game; just because its all CG and you could 'see' what they planned on doing, rather than just reading it.
<br />And Sol</div>
