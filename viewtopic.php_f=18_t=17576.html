			<div class="content">&lt;&lt;&lt;EDITED FOR IMPROVED SPECIFICATIONS&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br /><b>&lt;&lt;&lt;EDIT #2, more improvements, and clarification of what I mean by borrowing&gt;&gt;&gt; </b>
<br />
<br />I'm by no means an expert on modding, but I'm going to try this idea!!
<br />
<br /><b>EDIT #2:  I am primarily going to focus on ini editing.  Ships and more serious modding I may borrow, with permission, from other people's mods.  But for now, it is mere system building and normal editable modding options. </b>
<br />
<br />1. Disregard Earth being scrapped.  Add in Sol sector as a new system in the game with all 9 planets separated into four system quadrants with the Sun being the only common element in all of them.  Open, Non-disputed, and busy traffic jumpholes will be available to each quadrant for fast travel. 
<br />
<br />2. Have accurate number of moons or at least the primary ones around the planets.
<br />
<br />3. All factions are present in the system (1 in each quadrant, maybe a little overlap) each with a jumpgate or jumphole to the heart of their own system.  Maybe each controlling a planet of their own.  Around Earth itself would be disputed space.
<br />
<br />4. The factions of course need to protect those jumpholes and have 1 or 2 space stations guarding the jumps.  Also have extremely high encounter rates with that faction's army in that area. Especially Cruisers. <b>This is where I may borrow from other modders for captial ships to encounter and such. </b>
<br />
<br />5. Within these guarded areas other factions will have Encounter_Area_Assaults (all out war over the control of Earth).  Groups of 4 to a # as high as possible, swarming in to attack the enemy station and fleet.
<br />
<br />6. Pirate activity would be low, except maybe around space lanes.  As for the space lanes, a lot of them.  Scatter them so the player can use them strategicly to sneak through the lines of warring factions.  <b>I will be relying heavily on 3 dimensional space for this. </b>  And LOTS of traffic.
<br />
<br />7. Trading, some goods will have EXTREMELY high profits between different faction bases, but not between bases of their own faction.  The point is, for big profits you've got to run the Gauntlet from one faction across the system to the other faction.  <b>I may look into adding in at least a dozen more commodities into the game, perhaps Earth specific for export to the other worlds. </b>
<br />
<br />8. Each faction sells its own, what I call, &quot;Skirmisher&quot; and &quot;Speed Demon&quot;.  Types of ships in any particular form that either take a beating or outfly most of the faction ships in the area.  They would each have a fair amount of cargo room, not huge, but fair.  Obviously the prices for these ships should be very high and maybe require a friendly rating with the faction.  <b>I may also borrow here for more balanced ships between factions, as Liberty is quite weak in comparison. </b>
<br />
<br />9. Off the beaten path mine, <b>debris and asteroid fields </b> with very low faction encounter rates.  Maybe a bit higher pirate encounters.  <b>These will be strategically spaced to cover non-patrol routes and non-encounter areas for the Freelancer who finds the Gauntlet too tough.  Come in through the backdoor. </b>
<br />
<br /><b>10. New rumours for hidden secrets or possibly the best path through the gauntlet.  Even rumours for the best Earth goods to be traded out-system and where. </b>
<br />
<br />Addendum: (hard changes that may not be possible)
<br />A. <b>(EDIT #2 A was debris field and added in #9) </b>
<br />
<br />B. Factions have super destroyers/battleships cruising around.  Low encounter rate, but tougher than hell.  (With a powerful front shot weapon.)  Call them Decimators.
<br />
<br />ChrisV created a great version of this type of vessel and I will see if I can get them to do patrol routes and area assaults against stations.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />I have been looking at the tutorials and know this is no small undertaking, but I think it would bring about a new level of intensity to the game.  As well as bringing the action back to Earth.

			<div class="content">Good thinking man, I was thinking about getting a tutorial or some s**t like that and trying to make my own Sol System, I think Freelancer is seriously lacking in background stuff, like info and gameplay, I was thinking it would have been cool to have been a pilot in the Sol Sector during the battle of the Alliance and the Coalition. If anyone out here in Modville can send me some files for making a system and maybe a tutorial on how to use it, it would be much appreciated. I was also thinking when I got the game, even though I knew it was a flight sim, I thought you'd have some more interacting abilities while on the planets, or anywhere on ground. A good follow up to Freelancer would be a flight sim/maybe FPS in the Sol Sector during the C vs A (Coalition vs Alliance) war. W/E, Im just drifting off now so im gonna stop typing now.......

			<h3><a href="#p148634" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I realize it would be huge, that is what attracts me to the idea.  I don't think the human populous would ever leave Earth behind completely and what if one faction kept a foothold, then they would all want to keep one.  It's more realistic.
<br />
<br />A thought occurred to me.  Perhaps you could separate the Sol system into 2-4 smaller systems.  Put the planets in different quadrants around the sun.  The planets could even be spaced out non-linearly.  For instance; Mercury and Earth could be in one quad (system), while Venus and Mars could be in another system beause of their current orbits around the sun.  Earth and Mercury being on one side of the sun, while Mars and Venus would be on the other.
<br />
<br />Just add in a few more of the planets according to their orbit and distance from the sun, then you could have the same sun appear in all systems at different positions on each system map according to where the planets would appear in relationship to the sun.
<br />
<br />
<br />/ 1 / 2 /
<br />/+Sun+/
<br />/ 3 / 4 /
<br />
<br />This is a poor quadrant map, but you can see the four quads or however many in relationship to the sun which is the common element that appears in all of them.
<br />
<br />It's a little like the quadrant map in Privateer 1.
<br />
<br />Hope that was clear.

			<div class="content">I'm not very good at modding yet.  I haven't delved into it.  I have been changing ini files for years for other programs, so I have no difficulty reading them whatsoever.  I'm a natural born tweaker of most things.  I don't particularly care about adding new ships.  I can be satisfied with just doing the system and the complexity of game play using all the current Freelancer capabilities.  All the above thoughts for a mod are based off my initial understanding of what I can accomplish using the helpful tutorials on this forum.
<br />
<br />Perhaps when I reach the point where the Universe is the way I listed in my first post I will open it up for other users to post new ships into it and other things to expand on the game play.
<br />
<br />Q1  As a question to all expert modders.  Would doing the whole system be easer as 1 giant system, or multiple smaller systems?  If I recall currectly there might be a limit to the size of each system in Freelancer or maybe it was the Freelancer Universe as a whole.  I need clarification.  Last thing I want to do is waste my time on something that won't work to begin with.
<br />
<br />Q2  Has any one installed Freelancer twice?  I have two hard drives and think it might be helpful to have one be my modding game and the other be the one I play during that time.  Is it possible to load two games on one system?  Microsoft products are sometimes touchy about that.

			<div class="content">I have Starlancer, but I never beat it because I could never destroy all the damn torps coming to kill the cruiser fast enough.  I just lost interest.  WC3 and Priv 1 &amp; 2 kept me satisfied until Freelancer.
<br />
<br />As for XWA I still have it sitting on my shelf unopened.  I just never got around to playing, mainly due to the preference for the WC franchise over the SW space sims.
<br />
<br />Now that I know they have space suit troopers I will actually give it a try,
<br />
<br />Q1  I'm an certainly not going to do this, but is anybody making a mod to Freelancer to change all the planets and ships and etc to be a complete and immersible Star Wars Universe?  I would enjoy that immensely, since I have never really enjoyed a Star Wars game before (Except Galactic Battlegrounds).
