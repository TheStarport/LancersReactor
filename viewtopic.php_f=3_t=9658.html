			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p3648" class="post-subject">6 things that I feel would be easily added by a patch/expans</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">These are in no particular order.
<br />
<br />#1 - More ships/More sectors: This would obviously be more of an expansion pack item, but adding ships would be reletively easy. It'd just be a matter of somehow implementing this ship into the current world - maybe create 3-4 small bases (like the small outposts near certian jumpgates) that offer these new ships? Adding sectors could be explained through the construction of new jumpgates, or just by simply adding them and not explaining it - who cares? Although 48 sectors is a lot of space - maybe just add to the more sparce sectors instead of adding new ones....
<br />
<br />#2 - A dynamic economy: Another expansion pack item, but one that I believe could be done with great effect on the longenvity of Freelancer. Imagine having the economy shift upon your actions - you bring &quot;X&quot; peices of water to Pittsburg, and the demand for water on Pittsburg drops for a &quot;Y&quot; amount of time. And then just make it fluctuate randomly to some extent as well to keep you from earning a million credits on one cargo path. I'm not sure how easy this would be to program.. but dang, what an addition that would be!
<br />
<br />#3 - More Random Missions: This has been discussed to hell and back, but it's a must. Something that I believe could (and should) be added via a free patch. The 4 or so random mission types are, in reality, really just 1 type - &quot;go here, kill everything.&quot; We need &quot;escort this from point X to point Y (THROUGH MULTIPLE SECTORS!)&quot;, &quot;go to this sector with this item (cargo run missions where you are rewarded not for the profits of the item, but via reputation and for your ability to deliver to the right base. It's not currently possible to gain rep without fighting.... Imagine having a mission where you had to travel from one side of the universe to another in a set amount of time - how much FUN would that be?!)&quot;, &quot;Defend this base from a massive attack from this faction,&quot; &quot;Transport this person to this planet in this amount of time,&quot; etc. There are SO MANY types that really wouldn't be that hard to implement. They've got all the coding there, it's just a matter of making it generate randomly with different conditions. 
<br />
<br />#4 - Better &quot;minor NCP&quot; conversations - These are maddening. I'm sorry, but they are terrible. This would probably again be an expansion pack item (as sound files are large and the hiring of people to record them is expensive) Either remove them and create a &quot;rumor board&quot; instead, of record a LOT more conversation types. Examples - &quot;Hey Trent, haven't seen you for awhile - I just heard this rumor...&quot; &quot;Trent, good to see you. I have some information I thought you might be interested in.&quot; etc. etc. etc. etc. Nothing revolutionary, but just something to keep it from being SO *BORING*.
<br />
<br />$5 - Ability to demand that transports drop their cargo: This could probably be added via a free patch, but I wouldn't start crying if it was an expansion pack feature. I never did see why you have to destroy a transport to pirate them. Pirates don't always destroy - they demand you drop your cargo THEN kill you. If we had this option, being a pirate would seem much &quot;sleazier.&quot; The NCP's would then respond according to your level and your armement (like when they say over the comm &quot;I'm not engaging, he's too tough&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif  border=0 align=middle>. If you're armed to the teeth and they're in a level 1 Rhino, they drop their cargo or try to run away (Cruise disruptor!!). If you're just in a lightly armed frieghter or something, they say no and run away or attack you. Being a pirate would be infintely more enjoyable with this feature (in my opinion, of course).
<br />
<br />#6 - Joystick support: Obviously a PATCH feature (although, if they bundled it with an expansion pack that had other good features, I wouldn't be that upset). I won't go into this, as everybody has heard the arguments 20 times. I and many others long to grab their joystick and fight - I do it instinctively sometimes, just because it feels so RIGHT with this game. I know that we aren't supposed to discuss this, but damnit! Microsoft's Allegiance has 20x the items on screen and is 20x as complicated to play (no joking) as Freelancer does/is, and it uses a combo of mouse AND joystick. It works flawlessly.

			<div class="content">Great post Bacon,
<br />But do you really think it would be so easily implemented?? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Especially fluid or dynamic economy would be supleme but shear amount of systems and stations will make this a heavy programming task. In Privateer II a &quot;dynamic&quot; economy featured, but there was only about 20-30 planets an stations. In P II they also added random events like political catastrofies, famine, rebelwars and so on, which made the economi seem even more interactive.
<br />
<br />All your other suggestions are probably realativly easy to implement.

			<div class="content">Well DUH!  If it's as much as 250MB, it would be split into multiple download items...or even publish it as an expansion pack.  Definately NOT a single patch.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  BTW, about that &quot;only way to pirate is to destroy them&quot; thing you mentioned...I just remembered that GTA3 has the same problem.  You can't just mug them (or whatever) you have to kill them to get anything from them.  So yeah, I would like it if they did something about it.

<br />
<br />Bacon's ideas seem reasonable to me, but the trade routes database had to show the actual prices because I don't like wasting hours to find out where I can sell an item with most profit, for more than once... Also I don't really need joystick support, but I'd appreciate more control abilities like rolling or vertical strafing (don't know how easy THAT would be). And, of couse, ships that slow down constantly, not slowing from 300 or 200 to 80 immediately after leaving cruise mode or releasing the thruster...</div>

			<div class="content">I'd be pleased as punch to see just two of those in a free patch along with any bug fixes - more types of random missions and the ability to order someone to drop cargo.  The dynamic economy would be cool too, but probably would require a LOT of reworking for the game.  
<br />
<br />I think the universe is big enough as is and a patch shouldn't have to address this, but more places and ships would definitely be nice in an expansion.  And the NPC conversations aren't quite as bad as I was expecting from the demo - the full version seems to have fleshed them out at least a BIT more, though they are repetitive.  I would have simply made them all text boxes except for really important conversations or certain types of communication, but this'd be nice to see in an expansion as well.
<br />
<br />The joystick support is a non-issue for me - like the mouse control better at this point anyway.  Though I certainly wouldn't be opposed to its addition for those who want it (I just can't fathom it working well however).</div>

			<div class="content">Great Suggestions
<br />
<br />I have one of my own that i feel would go along good with the dynamic economy. Make the factions randomly go to war with eachother. You could let people know about it in news briefs such as war brewing, war declared, peace declared. Then you could have the prices for certain items depend on the current state of the war. I don't think this would be too hard to implement, and I would pay extra for it in a expansion pack.
<br />
<br />What would be really cool is if you could join a faction and participate in the wars. Factions would take enemy stations and bases, etc. I doubt that'll happen tho.

			<div class="content">I would gladdly pay 20 bucks for the expansion pack if they even just included NPC conversation/comms in-flight... i.e.
<br />
<br />1. taunt: suck on this, die!, you're going down buddy
<br />2. orders: order your wingmen about, tell a cargo ship to drop and leave etc...
<br />3. distress call: send out an emergency distress call, or respond to one
<br />4. base: request landing, request mooring, request status
<br />
<br />ARE YOU READING THIS DA?!??? YOU CAN MAKE SOME MONEY!!! (err... but if im the only one willing to pay then err... forget I even said anything <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />Other than that, those are some very good ideas, most of those things you have suggested have been posted in other threads many times... though it just goes to show wot a _^$&#163;$&amp;( up DA have made... I mean, they had 6 years to make it... you would think it would be bristling with features. Never mind.

			<div class="content">Cool ideas for a patch (although increasing the number of ships would probably have to be in an expansion pack).  How about this idea for a patch: Joining factions?  It's been discussed in other posts, but dangit!  Why do I have to be aligned with the Navy if I play a character on the legal side of the law?  I would like to see an icon pop-up that enables me to join a faction and have their ID tag floating over my ship.  Oh yeah, that and change the various top speeds of the fighters/freighters.

			<div class="content">I don't know if they'd actually be able to implement a truly &quot;dynamic&quot; economy.  As others have noted, it's hard to believe that a single pilot/freighter would be able to supply the demands of an entire planet.  Bringing 250 luxury items to a planet with 250,000,000 will barely effect the demand/price -- even if you made several dozen runs.  Not only that, but I don't think the engine tracks which ships are hauling which cargo where -- as far as I can tell, they seem to be randomly generated, and the computer only &quot;tracks&quot; them within a certain range of the player(s) ship(s).
<br />
<br />It would be much easier to implement a &quot;random&quot; economy.  Prices and availability are randomly generated at start-up.  During the game, the prices wil raise/fall based upon a randomly generated &quot;trend&quot;.  This would, effectively, give the players what they want w/o trying to simulate a quasi-realistic galaxy wide economy.  Granted, there could be some extremely lucrative runs out there, but the player would have to go find them... also, since the prices do fluctuate, there's no guarantee that the prices would remain good for too long (though, OTOH, the price difference could become better).
<br />
<br />Obviously if they could implement a dynamic, somewhat realistic, economy, that would be ideal, but personally I think it would be more work than it's worth.
