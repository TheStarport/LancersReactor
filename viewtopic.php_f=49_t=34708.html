<br />
<br />By  Jay Jay 
<br />
<br />Chapter 1
<br />
<br />One day Jack was on his way home from school. All of a sudden he heard a noise; it was getting closer and closer.
<br />
<br />At first he thought it was an aeroplane, because he lived so close to an airport, but as it got closer he could see that it wasn&#8217;t an aeroplane but an alien space ship (not the usual U.F.O, but a ship you would see in an navy).
<br />
<br />Once he knew what it was, he tried to run but his legs felt like jelly. As it got closer he saw a be a beam of light come down from it and tow people (that&#8217;s what they looked like at first) came down and, as they started to come towards him, he all of a sudden started to run. As he ran, he saw the people speed up. Soon he could hear their feet just behind him. The weird thing was that, even though he was running at full pelt, it sounded like they were just walking very quickly.
<br />
<br />He decided to go the long way round. He went down a back ally around the Main Street and down Red Drive, which is where his house is. He was now getting very tired, but he knew that he had to keep going. He just had to, but as he got closer to his house, he felt a hand on his shoulder and he froze. It was like nothing he had ever felt before. It was as cold as ice, maybe even colder than ice. Just then he heard a truck coming, and, at first, thought: thank god, but as the truck got closer the things (he knew now that they weren&#8217;t human) didn&#8217;t move, and when the truck got to them, it stoped, the back opened and he was put in. One of the aliens got in and put his, could grey, hand on his head. All of a sudden he felt very, very sleepy and, as the door closed and they started to move, he fell into a deep, deep sleep.
<br />
<br />Chapter 2
<br />                                                                                    
<br />When he woke he was in a room that, at first, looked like it had posters of stars, but when he look hard into, it, in fact, was a window looking out into space, and when he had a look around the room he saw two more of these windows. He was still looking at them, when two things came in. They looked like monks at first, because they wore rich red cloaks that had hoods, but when they took off the hoods, he could see that thay were not monks. For one, thay had two eyelids instead of one and, as he looked them over, he saw that that didn&#8217;t wear shoes; he could see they had webbed feet.
<br />
<br />Once he took it in, he started to speak.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; He said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We want your planet,&#8221; said one.
<br />&#8220;Take us to your leader&#8221; said the other.
<br />&#8220;Why do you want my planet?&#8221; said Jack.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We will ask the questions here,&#8221; said the first.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, ok.&#8221; said Jack &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to one of the leaders but it won&#8217;t be easy.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why is their more than one leader?&#8221; said the first.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Because of wars&#8221; said Jack. &#8221;They sometimes have wars&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So they are competitions,&#8221; said the second.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No.&#8221; said Jack &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to explain, and Im only a kid.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;A child yes but you have more knowledge of this planet than even our Emperor and he is the wisest of all of us.&#8221; said the first. He was about to go on, when he froze, in fact they both froze and stayed in that position for two minuets straight, and then relaxed &#8220; We are being called for, we must go&#8221; they said in unison and left.
<br />
<br />A couple of hours later the same two came back and they brought another kid with them. He looked to be about the same age as Jack but a bit taller than he was. The kid was asleep or unconscious, Jack couldn&#8217;t tell when he woke up, he looked dazed. After a bit he looked better.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hi&#8221; he said, &#8220;Where are we?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re on an alien space ship&#8221; Jack said &#8220;Are you ok?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think I am,&#8221; said the kid &#8220;What, did you say? Are we on a space ship? An alien space ship.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yea, why.&#8221; Jack said, &#8220;Are you an alien watcher?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, but my dad&#8217;s an astrologer, the names Jone by the why&#8221; said Jone &#8220;what&#8217;s yours&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Jack&#8221; said Jack.
<br />This is a story I have been working on for about a year now. I would like some feedback on what u think.  I hope u like it!!
