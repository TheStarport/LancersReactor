			<div class="content">When I was 11, I loved making models of WW2 war planes and tanks (1/24th scale).  I especially loved making the German tanks.  My room was very much &quot;festooned&quot; with tanks and planes.  I had dog fights suspened from my ceiling.  And my bookcase didn't have any books in them because I used the shelves for tanks and model cars.   I'd scrimp and save to buy them.
<br />
<br />I just loved making models..... although now I am wondering if the glue had anything to do with it...<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />While I was away at school one day, my mother had some friends over including a younger mother who had an extremely spoiled little brat of a boy.  I think he was 4.
<br />
<br />Mom had made the mistake of leaving my room door open and this little f@rt wandered into it and.... well.....let's just say that all of my cars and tanks were demolished.  To top it all off, he apparently started to cry like a banshee when he couldn't get at my planes so, to appease the little sh!t, they were taken down for him to play with as well.
<br />
<br />In one day, all of my models were destroyed by the time I'd gotten home.  My Mom, bless her, had no idea what those models meant to me ... she'd always scolded me for spending too much time on them anyway.  I was so angry with her I refused to speak to her.  It wasn't until after my Dad got home and he was able to comprehen what happened that it sank in to her.... mainly because he bawled her out like I had never heard him do before or after.  Made me feel a little better.
<br />
<br />Next day, Dad took me shopping for more models but I somehow lost interest in making any more and I opted for an HO scale slot car racing set with additional accessories.</div>

			<div class="content">Alright Taw and any interested parties, here it be...
<br />
<br />Well, my tale begins innocuously enough, my father went into hospital to have some kidney stones removed and, unbeknownst to me he had a heart condtion which had nearly killed him about eight years before. I knew that he suffered from angina, but that's about it. In any case, he had the stones removed, and the family went in to the hosital to see him. This was on a Tuesday, and my 14th birthday was three days later on the Friday.
<br />
<br />We came into his room and saw that he was ok, and gave him all of the appropriate platitudes (<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>). Before we left to go home, I told him that I hoped that he would be out of hospital in time for my birthday. He promised that he wouldn't miss it, and we left the hospital. Later that evening, we received *the call*, and we went down to the hospital to find out that he had died of a heart attack. 
<br />
<br />The next day (Wednesday), I threw myself into my work (I was assisting with a school Drama production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (long story)). That afternoon we went to the local church and attempted to make the funeral arrangements. The priest refused to have the funeral the next day as it was &quot;Holy Thursday&quot;, and we had to argue with him. Eventually, we convinced him and the funeral was held the next day. 
<br />
<br />The funeral was on Thursday morning and was fine as funerals go, but when we came home, we discovered that there were some unusual circumstances surrounding my father's death, as there was a ten minute delay (I think) before he was attended to after he suffered his heart attack, and he was not closely monitored despite his condition and the risks inherent in the procedure. Well, to cut a long story short there was dodgy stuff going on at that hospital, but nothing ever came out despite our investigations. 
<br />
<br />Now as you may recall, Friday was my birthday, and the funeral was held the day before. Needless to say, it was quite memorable <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. As you can see, it is all so laughably hackneyed that I still can't quite believe that it all happended that way it did; my father promising to come to my birthday, his death, the strange circumstances surrounding it, having to argue with the priest in order oo have the funeral, and my birthday being the day after my father was buried.
<br />
<br />Well that's it. Remember, you asked <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />Now tell me, isn't that the sort of thing that you would see if some dodgy soap opera?</div>

			<div class="content">@Esq, I understand perfectly; my grandad died in &quot;mysterious&quot; circumstances (ie not enough attention and care) just before Christmas 1974, and the local priest similarly refused to have the funeral on Christmas Eve, because they'd be getting ready for Midnight Mass. Of course, my dear old gran who wouldn't say boo to a goose esp if it was &quot;The Priest&quot; wouldn'tt stand up for herself and would have left the old boy's cadaver in its coffin in the front room over Christmas, unless my mum hadn't insisted that he have the funeral asap ie Christmas Eve. 
<br />
<br />local hospitals and Catholic priests - you'd think they were in it together, wouldn't you?

			<div class="content">I have told this story already and some of you might remember, but I'll tell it again for the ones who haven't heard it yet....
<br />
<br />It has to do with the birth of my daughter Lotte (Charlotte Emma). My wife unfortunately had a miscarriage the first time she was pregnant (she was like 10 weeks pregnant or so). Then when she got pregnant again, it was really stressful during the following 9 months as you can imagine. But, right from the start she got bleedings. It turned out to be her placenta which was laying very low in her uterus and that caused the bleedings. But every single time the bleedings occurred, we obviously got scarred as hell there might be something wrong again. I've been in the hospital for about 40 times during that 9 months for check ups and at one point they even made a mistake by telling us our baby had died (at 6 months pregnancy), we were absolutely devastated. It happened like this: My wife got bleedings again, so AGAIN we went to the hospital as quickly as we could for an ultrasound to see what was going on. We got there and they performed the ultrasound and I saw nothing move.....no heartbeat, no moving arms or legs, nothing....
<br />The woman who performed the ultrasound told us the bad news, your child has deceased... I remember my life flashing before my eyes, my tears burning, the breaking of my heart and the feeling I got hit on the head by a sledgehammer....
<br />
<br />After a while in a reflex, the woman hit a button and our child moved and I saw a heartbeat !!! What the...!?!! What happened!? the woman forgot to switch on the machine and told us our child was deceased, while nothing was wrong and she was alive and kicking ! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_shock.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> All she could say was &quot; Ooops, I'm really sorry about that &quot; I should probably have sued her ass for that huge medical error or Force Choke her to death or something, but at the time I was too blissfully happy to see my child alive and well, that I wasn't capable of anything except reassuring my wife our child was truly alright.
<br />
<br />Luckely it has a happy ending. My daughter is a lovely little girl, healthy and all and she will turn 1 next week, September 14 <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

Except for maybe that one time I jumped off my roof about 10 feet high. and slammed though my deck on my back and my dad came running up to see what slammed through and looks down the hole and sees me half covered in ivy with my arm broken and of course I only have one thing to say.
<br />
<br />Whoa....

<br />Course I had to fix the damn thing after I got back from getting a cast. but I remember all the signatures I got on it.

			<div class="content">Huh... there is some sad stuff here. I'm not sure if my clumsy antics will compare. Well anyway I've always been afraid of heights but when I read a book that had a guy who who climbed a mountain with two artificial legs. He mentioned one sentence and that was &quot;...yeah, I'm stoked and I just want everyone to know that even though it's rather clich&#233;, you should only fear fear itself.&quot; This guy kinda stuck with me and so I was determined to break my fear. I went tandem skydiving and when I got to the door I just froze as I expected and I had originally told one of the instructors about this. He booted me and the other guy out of the plane and for awhile it scared the f****in crap out of me. Then, when the parachute eventually  opened it was f****in amazing. So I kinda lost my fear after that and got (sigh) a bit cocky. 
<br />
<br />My native New Zealand has a great many of mountains to climb as you could probably see in Lord Of the Rings (no, there is no real Mount Doom in NZ). So after climbing a couple, me and my mates from university decided to take it up a level and climb a hard peak somewhere in Arthur's Pass. While resting on the edge of a ridge and enjoying the panarama spread across in front of us I got up to check the gas burner. Ice sure is slippery. I went to get up and my boot slipped on the ice. We had been doing it all day as it was rather icy above the treeline but I fell back to far and started skidding down a steep ridge. Normally in movies this is where the dude would pull out a small ice pick or piton and suddenly stop. But this was real life and I rolled and skidded down the small slope. I luckily managed to roll and come to a stop on a large outcrop of rock but broke three fingers, my right leg and ankle and also several ribs in the process.B-) Thankfully after we didn't return on the date we specified, some DOC (Department of Conservation) guys tramped up to where we were and I was eventually helped down out of the area.
<br />
<br />I still get freaked out driving around steep cliffs and peninsulas but am going to try Caving in New Zealand's limestone caves that honeycomb certain areas to cure my claustrophobia. Finally all I can say is that listen to that dude. If your scared of something just try something related and maybe you'll enjoy it. Oh and if you want a good place to do some adventure tourism come to New Zealand!! We have almost everything you could ever need in adventure tourism apart from space travel. Oh and a lot of NZ'ders love alpine areas because there are scree slides!!!! (Natural gravel slide) It's a custom to run down as fast as you possibly can and totally waste yourself. If you ever do anything useless in your life do that. Biggest Adrenaline Rush...EVER!!! Just watch out for the treeline because remeber, you're running down gravel on a side of a mountain
<br />
<br />Does that count as advertising? Please let me know if it does...
