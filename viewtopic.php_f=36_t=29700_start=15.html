			<div class="content">Ohh the Horror! ORN! I feel my fluid draining away...*cough cough. The Hutt was quite brutally challenged by Kaos-ORN, wew what a fight. After sending my underling who died like flies against him, the Slug master must personally take care of matter. Sooooo....ORN uses cybernetic implants to pilot their ships eh? Well the Hutt purchased a Shadow ship and firmly implanted himself into it. The duel was a blast...best rush i've had for a while. In the end we came to a draw but i must say Kaos is very good. Flying a ship with weaker powerplant and lower hull, he stood up to my attacks. I applaud you Mr. Kaos. 
<br />
<br />In other matters, it would seem that the final moments of the general election in Liberty threw the nation into chaos. Madame Jacobi suffered an apparent attack while parading through the central square of Manhatten greeting her supporters in the last minutes before election. &quot;At first I heard weird noises...sounds of groaning&quot; said Jacobi's driver. &quot;One moment she was waving to the voters, the next she was on the floor of the car and moaning...'it hurts! it hurts!' &quot; reported a bodyguard. &quot;We thought that a sniper with an ultra silent buffer was on the roof top and shot her in the stomach, so we flung ourselves...unlike those cowardly taiwanese bodyguards...on to her and covered her from anymore possible attacks. The president's car sped away by the prompts of the body guards. The spectators was shocked at the incident...&quot;Oh my god! they shot that poor women! If she survives, im soooo gonna vote for her&quot; commented one spectator. Arriving at the hospital, doctors and nurses scramble to save her life using the latest ultra-high tech medical technology. To their dismay they couldn't find the bullet hole...&quot; Oh my god! Its an ice projectile spiked by poison! She's a gonner&quot; screamed a bodyguard crying with grief. After further examination, it was found that the president only suffered a violent episode of diarrhea. But election results swayed to her favor due to sympathy of the voters. Accusations arose that she pulled off a political stunt in order to maintain her office. Opposition leaders demanded invalidation of the election due to unfair influence.  The likelyhood of orchastrating this stunt is currently been investigated. &quot;We think her actions was highly irresponsible...who eats rotten apples before a parade???&quot; said lead federal investigation. Jacobi is hiding in her residence declining any interview, she only responded that what she did wasnt intentional and that a full investigation will be carried out. Opposition leader scoffed at her comments. &quot;What are the police gonna do? Interrogate the rotten apples as to why they were in her stomach making trouble?&quot;
<br />
<br />Go figure...Jabba likes the president, she's pretty hot.

			<div class="content">The Hutt is in the process of moving. Im relocating to a more open lair as my collection of slave girls is taking up too much space. I planned a nicely built harem/dungeon for them. As for my old place...any offers? Its a grand lair by any design and support 50 nicely build rooms. Unfortunately the floors are ruined by my slug slime...and the stentch is alittle too much. I'll tell you what, 30% discount to any buyers. Haggling is always welcome.

<br />Unfortunately, the new lair of the Hutt won't be disclosed to anyone. Not even to Solo.

<br />I can't be bothered with hiring cleaning crew. Take it as it is and clean it up yourself. 
<br />
<br />Ahhhh the Hutt returns to his normal programming. The lair relocation has been tiring. Can't trust these corillians to do anything right...you hear that solo!! Cant do anything right! Bah...he lost another batch of MY cargo on a trade run. I dont want to hear excuses Solo. I should've had your head a while back.
<br />
<br />Now back to business. It would seem the HOPE - the Hydrogen Producing Entente is ready to cut back on their production of valuble hydrogen fuel. Major H-fuel sectors in  sirus reported a sharp decline in H concentration in the major cloud fields. With looming production shortages and no prospect of new H-fuel sources, the HOPE organization has decided to dramatically cut back the supply of H-fuel. In a statement from the HOPE spokesman: &quot;We have decided to take on the responsibility of preserving the valuble H-fuel resources for later generations. In the face of the upcoming crisis, the GMG, IMG and BMM have made a mandate to restrict supply in hope of cutting back demand.&quot; In the upcoming months, HOPE will close off the tap and supply only 85% of current flow. The organization is expecting to keep cutting back the supply 5% every year. 
<br />&quot;This is absolutely ridiculous!&quot; screamed Bretonian chief financial minister Brian Woodcock. &quot;How could these people expect the universe to survive on so little fuel supplied to us?  I have demanded BMM to explain their actions, founded as a crown coporation, they literally stabbed the Bretonian people in the back.&quot; 
<br />Liberty's State department issued a more stern warning to the Entente: &quot;Their current action disgusts the citizens of Liberty and surely the citizens of all houses. Not only are they practicing a monopoly over the H-fuel market, they spewed lies of 'saving' the resources for later generations. No such thing! By the research of our Institute of Earth, Ocean, Astrogeoraphical and Natural Resources Research and Development, we found that the current H-fuel level only dropped by 2% in the last 200 years because of extensive mining activities. Surely, by the time that we reached the end of the H-fuel supply, the human race must surely developed a new technology to not use H-fuel as fuel. If the actions of HOPE doesn't stop then Liberty must take steps, politically, economically and even militarily to preserve the rights to pump as much gas we want for the freedom loving people of liberty.&quot; When asked by reporters just where can they find the institute of Earth...(INTEROANRED) the spokesman jump off the podium and quickly exited. &quot;Nonsense!&quot; commented astrogeologist Norman Laudaas. &quot;What they failed to tell you was that 97% of the H-fuel supply in sirus are so dilute that you are required to have a ship dragging a net 10 times the surface area of Planet Manhatten, running at light speed through the systems for 10 years to obtain 10 gallons of liquid H-fuel. Its impossible to mine them! So taken that into perspective, the people of sirus is left with only 1% minable H-fuel gas cloud. As for an alternative energy source...i doubt they could come up with anything better then fusion and Hydrogen is the BEST material for our current fusion engines. And there is no such agency as INTEROANRED, thats just fantasy on part of the liberty government high on cardamine.&quot;
<br />Political Economist Sauder Liliwipe commented on the events. &quot;Obviously HOPE does forsee the looming crisis of H-fuel shortage. What they are banking on now is to cut supply, boost the price so that they can make large amount of profits for a sustained period until the H-fuel ran out. They would probably go buy a resource rich planet and settle down as the rest of sirus dies off with lack of fuel for transport. Liberty is of course taking the position of 'Spend now worry later.' The threat of use of force could indicate their thirst for expansion and may very well have an excuse to take over HOPE territories to control the H-fuel for themselves. All in all we are screwed!&quot;
<br />
<br />Hmmmm...dont worry citizens of sirus, the Hutt has a card up his sleeves...leftover shadow gravimetric tidal engine that harness the infinite energy of hyperspace. Provided of course you can pay for such an exotic engine...Buy em while you can from the Hutt!

The Hutt will offer a grand prize of 100 million credit to any Bounty hunter who corners the rabbit. And who is the target? No idea....the Hutt will have a democratic vote amoung the players of WTS. The person with the most vote against him will be the chosen rabbit of the chase. 
<br />
<br />The objective of the chase is to corner the target, i.e. kill em and camp out on their respawn point. If you were able to capture them when they respawn and pin them down, you will recieve the prize. 
<br />
<br />Clan effort and individual alliances are allowed. No admin power maybe used in the Hunt. (i.e. ASF jumpholes) The target may not switch chars when they are about to be pinned, the target cannot go offline in fear and return when everything is clear. (If you need to go in real life then its allowed but you must not come back within 2 hours)
<br />
<br />Ok everyone cast your votes for a target. $100 million!! A word for the wise, pick your target carefully. Picking people with powerful ships could prevent you from pinning them.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The Hutt is watching</div>
