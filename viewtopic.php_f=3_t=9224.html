			<div class="content">My &quot;wish list&quot;...
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>1. Dynamic Trading   </b>
<br />Mostly only for MP reasons, but would still add playing time and options to the SP game as well...to stop the &quot;start at midnight, rich by 1AM&quot; style of playing.
<br />If I sit outside a planet and destroy every ship trying to land there I would expect to see them run out of some goods and start offering more cash for any shipments which may make it through...the players shipments may not make much difference in an economy, but those cargo haulers with 1,000,000 tons of goods never reaching dock sure seem like they should.
<br />
<br /><b>2. Multiple Ship Ownership.   </b>
<br />Yeah, I am a &quot;freelancer&quot;, that still doesn't explain why I can only own one ship.
<br />So, I don't &quot;belong&quot; to any &quot;faction&quot;. That means I can't rent a space at a port to store an extra ship or two?
<br />The whole idea of being a &quot;freelancer&quot; is being able to take whatever job you want to and take it whenever you want to take it.
<br />Having to sell off &quot;ship a&quot; and all it's gear just top buy &quot;ship b&quot; and all it's needed gear to take a different style job for a while seems rather stupid for any rational mind to accept.
<br />
<br /><b>3. TRUE differences in ships.   </b>
<br />Even just allowing the upgrades that have been disabled in the game to again be purchased and used. To allow ships to handle better, go faster, fight better, defend better, whatever the owner really wants them to do best.
<br />Right now I see very little difference between most ships in the game...which is why you usually see the same ship being used by every player at any given level...boring.
<br />Any time you can SO easily say what the &quot;best&quot; ship is and what it's &quot;best&quot; selection of &quot;add-ons&quot; is and don't even have anyone debating it...well it just says to me that there are some things wrong.
<br />
<br /><b>4. MORE OPTIONS   </b>
<br />Basic options.
<br />Like difficulty sliders/toggles that;
<br />
<br /><b>a)   </b> Stops the &quot;Meet Juni At Manhattan&quot; type of messages that flash every 3 minutes in <b>BIG BOLD LETTERS   </b> across the middle of the screen. For God's sake, why did they bother to even put the journal in if they were just going to hold your hand through the whole campaign and remind you every 3 minutes anyway? If I want to know what to do next in the SP game I will check the damed journal, I don't need to be NAGGED about it.
<br />If my woman kept telling me &quot;You should vaccuum!&quot; every three minutes I would gag her, lock her in the closet, and leave her there for the night! 
<br />
<br /><b>b)   </b> Stop waypoints from being made for EVERY MISSION. I am not an idiot and I think most other players aren't either. If the mission description says to go to area &quot;4C&quot; I think I can find it without somebody holding my hand and guiding striaght to the mission location of putting waypoints up for me so all I have to do is keep hitting F2 or F3 until I get there. 
<br />*I* think it may even be fun to just be told &quot;Go kill 'Joe X'. We THINK he may be in the New York system&quot; and have to actually WORK to find the target, and EARN the reward.
<br />
<br /><b>c)   </b> Adjusts starting faction reputations. Sometimes you want to start the game friendly to people just to have it easier, other times you may want to start the game without everybody being your friend. I personally HATE being so friendly with so many factions in the SP game, I would rather have to earn their trust than have it just given to me. If this means I have to wait a while to meet Juni someplace because they won't let me land yet...GREAT! It makes the game last LONGER.
<br />
<br /><b>d)   </b> Adjusts damge given/received. It already seems to be an option, but they never tied it INTO the choosable otions. It is in the PerfOptions file though. Just needs some refining and installation finished.
<br />
<br /><b>e)   </b> Turns off the &quot;turret view&quot; on-screen notification, the &quot;mouse flight&quot; on-screen notification, etc. All that crap doesn't need to be shown all the time. I think we know what &quot;modes&quot; we are in without the being written there for us like we are morons.
<br />
<br /><b>f)   </b> Actually TURNS OFF the HUD section at the top center, instead of just making it a &quot;rollover&quot; pop-up type of thing. It is nothing but annoying to turn it off and still have it popping up to obstruct my view whenever I try to target something in that area of the screen.
<br />Plus, anyone whom has played for more than ten minutes seems to use KEYSTROKES for those actions anyways. We should be able to TOTALLY disable the damned thing, not just make it &quot;auto-hide&quot;.
<br />
<br /><b>5. Join a Faction   </b>
<br />It is VERY rediculous to believe that the player is the ONLY person in the ENTIRE Sirius System wchich is not aligned with a faction.
<br />Saying &quot;it's called freelancer&quot; is NO excuse.
<br />I have DONE &quot;freelance&quot; work, and MANY times it leads to being HIRED PERMANENTLY!
<br />If nothing else there should AT LEAST be OTHER &quot;freelancers&quot; flying around for the player to meet in the game. Seeing only people which belong to large groups makes one feel more like a pariah than a freelancer.
<br />
<br /><b>6. FIX MULTIPLAYER!!!   </b>
<br />They need to have the server run from a SEPARATE set of INI files, and ONLY from the SERVERSIDE set of INI files!
<br />This would not only help make the game more cheatproof, but would also make it easier for server hosts to run &quot;Mods&quot; on their servers without the &quot;mods&quot; also affecting any SP games they may play from the same machine.
<br />
<br /><b>7. Missions   </b>
<br />Put all the ones they reportedly took out for being &quot;uneccessary&quot; back in.
<br />Period.
<br />
<br /><b>8. Bounty Board   </b>
<br />The &quot;News&quot; board chould also have a &quot;Outstanding Bounties&quot; alert section.
<br />This would list NPCs, and even PLAYERS in a MP game, which have been breaking laws(Killing Pilots, Caught Smuggling, etc) in the current system, and list what the reward is for &quot;bringing them to justice&quot;.
<br />There wouldn't need to be any &quot;accepting&quot; these missions. Just the next person/NPC that kills the listed criminal would recive the reward posted automatically, and recieve a message saying so.
<br />Players could even be allowed to post such bounties on other players. It would just add a lot of depth to the game in my opinion...it has in other games I have played.
<br />
<br /><b>9. Death PENALTIES  </b>
<br />In MP there SHOULD be REAL PENALTIES to being killed. As it is right now you just respawn at a base with full health. Seems more like a reward to be honest. Oh yeah, you lose whatever cargo/unequiped weapons you were carrying, big deal. That is only a penalty to players that run cargo. It does NOT penalize those players which mainly attack other players....they rarely carry anything they will lose.
<br />I think it should take an amount of your cash on hand equal to the value of the ship and it's equipment you had when you died, to pay for a new ship/equipment of the same type you had. And, if you do not have enough cash it should put you on the base(The last one you were on that sold any ships.) with NO ship, and you must buy what ever one is there which you can afford and whatever equipment you can afford....if you cannot afford any then you must start over, it is essentially true &quot;death&quot;.
<br />IF the &quot;multiple ship ownership&quot; was also added then it should just send you back to the base where you store your other ships, whichever base is closest if you have ships at more than one base.
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway, they are the main ones on my &quot;wish list&quot;.
<br />I don't think ANY will ever &quot;come true&quot;.
<br />I still enjoy the game though, but there is no such thing as perfection. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
