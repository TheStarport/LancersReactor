			<div class="content">Inside, however, &#8220;Mr. President, we have passed the first leg with no problems, Sir&#8221; the aide said.
<br />
<br />President Pierce looked at the aide, &#8220;That remains to be seen, we have a long way to go.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The president went back tot he book he was reading even as the train began a slow climb over part of the Appalachian mountain area. The trees were beautiful, the streams they passed, breathtaking. 
<br />*
<br />Locutus was driving his horse to near death speed. He was about twenty minuets away from his town. His heart beating faster and faster. He had to make it, for them. He slowed as he reached the first building. Lighting off the horse, he drew and cocked the rifle and drew one of his pistols. He moved in the shadows of each building, till he got closer to the hotel. His thought deep, his thoughts focused on one thing. Slowly, methodically, he neared the back stairs. His saw the room, now if he could just get there unnoticed. Half way up the stairs, he heard her voice, his wife. That drew him own. As he reached the window, he peaked in, seeing his wife and children tied up, and only one guard. He had to wait till the guard turned toward the door. NOW, his time came. Firing the rifle and pistol at the same time, he killed the guard. A second opened the door only to be gunned down.
<br />
<br />After removing the gag in his wife&#8217;s mouth, he learned that there was only the two guards. Locutus breathed a sigh of relief and collapsed in his wife&#8217;s arms, barely able , he drew his daughters to him, weeping.
<br />
<br />Bargib explained to the others the reason for Locutus&#8217;s departure and said that the plan would resume. Time was running out to set a good defense. He was hoping that once the orchestrators of their plan, would rethink it when the truth got out, however, Bargib was doubtful. Until they knew what happened to locutus, it was still a risk. 
<br />
<br />President Pierce was studying the budget when his aide approached. &#8220;Mr. President, we will be stopping soon to take on water, are you sure you want to leave the train&#8221;? The aide was so nervous that he was sweating. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, I am sure&#8221; The president replied, &#8220;I want to meet the people who voted for me, to see the needs first hand.&#8221; He went back to his papers, the mattered settled. The aide, just moved back tot eh other car, a strange look on his face.
<br />
<br />Indy met sw at the school to talk to her about her stories. She had brought what she had written and gave it to Indy to see what he would be interested in. After an hour of reading, he had three of the stories to start and agreed to run them one a week on the Saturday run. He also agreed to pay her five dollars for the stories. A months wage would go a long way for sw. She told him of the one she was working on and he agreed to review it when she was finished with it. 
<br />
<br />The train was slowing as it reached the water tower. The Marshal in charge had his men in the presidents car before it stopped. He was reliable and would never fail his mission. The presidents aide had asked him to give him a hand with something, but the marshal just asked another to help the aide. He did not leave his duty for anything. And, the aide set off his warning feeling. He nothing as yet, but he was on alert.
<br />
<br />Locutus was able to get his family out of town and over to Tawsburg and get back to Bargib in under three hours. He could do his duty now, but there would be something to answer for after all was said and done. After all, he had agreed to betray the president, even if he had good reason. He was learning the value of friendship and friends. And now he thought on the ones he had harmed. 
<br />
<br />Chips continued his rounds, checking some of the regular places and some not so regular. Nothing was found. They had fifty marshals here now and the train was expected tomorrow. Bargib had his plan set. He only hoped Locutus would be back soon, and to find out what was going on. He did not like not knowing. 
<br />
<br />Wolfy had the first order of lumber loaded up in the buckboard and was hitching the tem to take it over to the school house. It would be part of the addition that was to be built. Wolfy loved hard work. It kept him busy. Too busy to have his mind on someone else, sw. He would have time later to talk to her. Her smile was just so captivating. He enjoyed her friendship very much. 
<br />*

			<div class="content">Chips continued his rounds, checking some of the regular places and some not so regular. Nothing was found. They had fifty marshals here now and the train was expected tomorrow. Bargib had his plan set. He only hoped Locutus would be back soon, and to find out what was going on. He did not like not knowing. 
<br />
<br />Wolfy had the first order of lumber loaded up in the buckboard and was hitching the tem to take it over to the school house. It would be part of the addition that was to be built. Wolfy loved hard work. It kept him busy. Too busy to have his mind on someone else, sw. He would have time later to talk to her. Her smile was just so captivating. He enjoyed her friendship very much. 
<br />*
<br />A young marshal that came aboard at the last town was watching as the Presidents aide carried a bag out of the car to the step area. He looked nervous as he scanned the area as the train was coming to a bridge over a river. At the river, the aide gave the bag a toss so that it landed near the trestle and not in the water. The Marshal watched as a man moved up from the river and picked the bag up. The aide looked up an saw that he was being watched. He quickly climbed the ladder to the to of the car. The Marshal quickly followed drawing his pistol. The train took a curve and the Marshal lost his footing and had to drop hi gun to grab on. As he regained his feet, the aide had drawn a knife and was moving toward the young man. The aide was obviously good with a knife, but continued to miss his swings. The young man deftly dodged and fainted, moving till he was centered on the car. The President poked his head up the ladder at that moment that the young man executed a perfect round house kick, knocking the aide off the train, the body tumbled over and over coming to a rest in a heap in a ditch. Dead.
<br />
<br />Dr. Taw was in the forum, a piece of paper laid out on the table. Esq walked in and noticed that Taw did not even look up, which he never did. Dr. Esq let the chair scrap when he pulled it out. Taw did not even move. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to know what is going on&#8221; Esq thought. He went to move the paper and Taw jumped. His face, a look of surprise, &#8220;Esq when did you get here&#8221;? Esq just shook  his head.
<br />
<br />The president was waiting when the Marshal came down the ladder. &#8220;Son, you have some explaining to do&#8221; the president spoke, seemingly peeved. 
<br />
<br />The young man moved back into the Presidents car. &#8220;Mr. President, my name is Little Monkey, though I go by LM &#8220; he began, &#8220;Your aide, was a traitor&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Explain yourself&#8221; he president responded, clearly interested. 
<br />
<br />LM pulled out a telegram from his shirt pocket and handed it to the president who opened it and read it. &#8220;My God, I can&#8217;t believe the intrigue that&#8217;s going on around me&#8221; the president fumed. The telegram said to expect trouble on the train. That there was a traitor, but had not been identified. It gave the young man leeway to handle the situation as long as the president was in no danger. Looking up from the paper, the president sat back in his chair and scratched his chin. &#8220;What was that move you used on the car against my aide?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir, it was a round house kick, that was aught to me by a Chinaman on the railroad work team five years ago&#8221; LM said, &#8220;He said it and a few other moves could one day save my life&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It certainly worked here&#8221; the president said, I am very impressed. What town are you from, son?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tawsburg, sir&#8221; LM answered, &#8220;My parents are Dr. And Mrs Taw.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tawsburg?, that&#8217;s one of the towns on our route tot he coast&#8221; the president said as he paged through his notes. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes sir, that was one of the reasons I requested to be on the train&#8221; LM said, a smile on his face. He thought of seeing his dad and mum again.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, now back to business, my aide, what was he up to and how does it effect us&#8221; the president asked. LM spent the next hour explaining the story and ended on seein the aide throwing the bag from the train. That, got the presidents attention. &#8220;What did that bag look like?&#8221;
<br />
<br />LM explained that it was like a small bag that one would carry papers in for business. The president signaled another man and sent him to the presidents private sleeping quarters. 
<br />
<br />Taw explained that a &#8220;family&#8221; member would be arriving in town by train soon. He did not go into who, and Esq decided not to push it. He got up and went to the bar and returned with two cups of tea. He knew it would relax Taw.  They sipped for an hour, silence telling a thousand words. Friendship sometimes waited and was always there.
<br />
<br />sw had left copies of her writings with Indy, but kept her newest story and headed over to the school house. She wanted to see Wolfy and knew that he was hauling lumber over there all day. She was still sorting out her feelings and needed to do a little more work inside the school room. Well, a little work anyway.
<br />
<br />Bargib had all the men he needed now. And as of five minuets ago, a new telegram that came from the town the train was at before they arrive in Tawsburg. There was news of the train plot with the aid and the loss of critical info. With that news, Bargib sent a wire to the nearest army fort requesting men be sent now.

			<div class="content">sw had left copies of her writings with Indy, but kept her newest story and headed over to the school house. She wanted to see Wolfy and knew that he was hauling lumber over there all day. She was still sorting out her feelings and needed to do a little more work inside the school room. Well, a little work anyway. 
<br />
<br />Bargib had all the men he needed now. And as of five minuets ago, a new telegram that came from the town the train was at before they arrive in Tawsburg. There was news of the train plot with the aid and the loss of critical info. With that news, Bargib sent a wire to the nearest army fort requesting men be sent now. 
<br />*
<br />Locutus had so much on his mind, but the best part he was no longer worry about, was his family, they were safe. He knew he would have a lot to give an account for. Fear factor had wired Washington of the news and developments. He also gave an appraisal that locutus was still of value to stop this plot. It helped Locutus&#8217;s spirit a bit to hear this.
<br />
<br />The Dry gulch saloon was empty. Business was slow at mid day. The man in charge of the meeting was back. Kelsy was there as well. &#8220;Look Tom, we got the information we needed, the train will be stopping at Tawsburg and we can take care of the business then and there.&#8221;	
<br />
<br />Tom looked at Kelsy with contempt on his face. &#8220;You have no idea of what is going on here, do you?&#8221; he started, &#8220;You think this is just killing a man, even the president?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But Tom, we just thought, I mean I thought that...it was just a job to do&#8221; kelsy said nervously. 
<br />
<br />Tom got in Kelsy&#8217;s face. &#8220;The people behind this already have another plan for the next president in the event that we fail&#8221; Tom almost spit out, &#8220;Which means we DON&#8217;T fail, period!&#8221;	
<br />
<br />Kelsy climbed into the saddle and grabbed the reins. His men would be waiting one mile north of Tawsburg. From there, they would see the train when it arrived. They couldn&#8217;t move until they saw the steam being vented. Once it was gone and they were taking on water, he could attack and the president could not escape.
<br />
<br />Clayton had been watching the meeting and learned from Kelsy&#8217;s mistakes. He headed to is men and got them into place and then settled down by the campfire and had a cup of coffee. The men were cleaning their guns and generally just relaxed. He shook his head, if they only knew.
<br />
<br />Wolfy had the second load of lumber unloaded at the school house when sw arrived. She parked her buggy near the hitching post. He heard the sound of hammers from in back. She headed that was and mas amazed at the progress of the workers. The foundation stones were set and the frame work of the floor was in place. Wolfy wiped sweat from his brow and started to put his hat back on. But when he saw sw, he stopped and said&#8221; Welcome sw, is there anything I can do for you?&#8221;
<br />
<br />The President got the report he dreaded. The itinerary he had in his quarters was gone. Now they knew his destinations. The Tawsburg stop was ok, but the others were in jeopardy. He would have no choice but to stop the trip and return to Washington. He would still go through with the next stop and visit the town as planed. Tawsburg had impressed him very much with its courage and fortitude. He wanted to meet these kinds of people. People with heart.
<br />
<br />Tawsburg was ready as far as water and wood goes, the protection was in place. They would use the barricades again like they did when they faced the gang. Bargib had everything in place including a few surprises, thanks to the information from Locutus. 
<br />
<br />The conclustion will be either tomorow night or early on saturday <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
