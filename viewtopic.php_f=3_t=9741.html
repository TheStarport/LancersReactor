			<div class="content">Well after 4 days of solid play. I am now losing total interest in what has proven to be a very short lived game. Good while it lasted though!
<br />
<br />Having completed all the Storyline Missions. And now having bought myself the Titan with a Level Rating of 33. I am totally losing inteast in the game. I know I can go to a higher Level Rating in the game of around Level 38. But at what point. All I will be doing to achive this is just repeating the standard missions in the game over and over again. And there are no further in-game Story Missions once I achieve this highest Level from what I've read here in the Forum.
<br />
<br />I have more or less got myself all the in-game secret Weapons from the Detroyed Ships floating around in space. The Trading part of the game leaves a lot to be desired. And again what is the point of this because it only leads to having more cash in the bank. That I can do nothing with!
<br />
<br />I can't use it to buy a Space Station, Or even build loads of them in a Sector in space. Nor can I buy a Fleet of fighters to use in protecting them, or for my own personal use.
<br />
<br />Once again just like Starlancer the game in pretty much Strory Line Mission based only. And leaves you feeling that there is no point in playing the game, once you have completed them!
<br />
<br />I ask you all is this it! After waiting 3 years for it's release. 4 Days of game play!
<br />
<br />Bring on &quot;X2&quot; Egosoft because I'm now bored again!

<br />I picked up Splinter Cell and finished it in 8 hours with no replayability at all in it.  At least we can do M/P here.

<br />
<br />Multiplayer you say. Lets have a game then via IP Address. I will host the game on my 1mb connection. Oh I forgot the game does'nt suport it!
<br />
<br />OK! Lets go to MSN Game Zone and play it there. Dam again they are not suporting the game there also like they did with Starlancer.
<br />
<br />Need I say more! apart from the fact that the Multiplayer part of this game sucks big time. And even with a very fast connection here. There game is slow and ****y in the game. When you join the Servers&lt; even with a low PING!
<br />
<br />Why they did'nt include the option to play via IP Address is a big let down for me.

<br />I would have thought this game would have been more than just one disk. I had STARLANCER here that I bought from the shops. And that was a Two Disk game. I could be wrong! 
<br />
<br />I've managed to download the Cue and the NFO file. But I'm seeing &quot;0&quot; sources on the Bin files. And that connected to SILENT BOB server also.
<br />
<br />=========================================
<br />
<br />Does this game require Dirext X 9.0 to play! And am I right in saying it is Mouse controled only, and no Joystick is used! 
<br />
<br />PS: What Server are most of you guys on here who's trying to download it?
<br />
<br />=========================================
<br />
<br />Just a couple of questions people! 
<br />
<br />1. For those people who have already downloaded this game, installed it, and played it. What do you think about the new Mouse control method being used, instead of Joystick method that was used in Startlancer. Personally I thought Joystick method of control in Starlancer worked very well, and I've never been a fan of the new Mouse control being used in this game. How does it compare? 
<br />
<br />2. How would you compare the graphics to there previous version called Starlancer? 
<br />
<br />3. I much perfare the game called X-Tension by Egosoft over there previous Starlancer game. Simply because there was much more to the game in terms of the extra features, game options, Lastabilty, and more! Seeing as they also have there new game called X2 The Threat in the pipework due for release in March. How do you rate this game overall! Because it's going to have to be very good game indeed with tons of features, and unlimited lastabilty if it hopes to compete with X2 The Threat . Which by the way is Joystick controled, and not Mouse driven. 
<br />
<br />PS: 
<br />Please keep them FULL SOURCES shared! There are only a very few Full Sources being showed in 600 Sources here in my list! 
<br />
<br />It's a real pity about the Sound problems, Did this happened during the ripping process? Or is it a fault on the original disk itself? So does this mean we all have to edit our Windows Sounds settings now to be able to hear all the In-Game speech sounds. And will altering the Windows Registry effect windows in other ways! Because I do not want to do this just to play one game. If it's going to cause problems with Windows in the long run. Even though I want this game! More information on this sound problem would be more than welcome! 
<br />
<br />============================================
<br />
<br />NO,NO,NO THIS CANNOT BE!!! 
<br />
<br />I have downloaded 235mb so far! But I have just checked the FILE DETAILS. And I have lossed 180mb due to Corruption. And gained 185mb due to Comression. Leaving me with about 225mb completed. Whats going on here! How the hell can I gain 185mb due to Compression when I've only downloaded 235mb. What the hell was it compressed with? A speeding train! Because I want that program like yesterday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
<br />
<br />I strongly suggest you all do the same check! 
<br />
<br />
