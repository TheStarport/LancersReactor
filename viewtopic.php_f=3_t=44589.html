			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p34067" class="post-subject">What is your favorite Mod?</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Because some people ask about good Mods, I decided to start a new Topic with Favorites Mods.
<br />Here you can tell to the others what you like or what you think may be improved in future version.
<br />Just simple opinion or small ideas.
<br />
<br />And because I started this, I began first.
<br />
<br />Evolution Mod: Well... Few bad things I can say about it.
<br />It's have good balanced ship and weapon, but I don't really like the the design of the cargo hold. I know the reason it is like this, but for a Freelancer a Fighter Ship with a tiny cargo hold it's not reliable. And it's a bit annoying to change the ship into a freighter when you need money then to changed back when you need to fight! Here some improvements it's can be made, a intermediate ship let's say with good fighting skill and enough cargo hold, different than what games have, and very expensive one!  And this ship you'll find only in very restricted area or like a bonus if you like.
<br />I didn't find any bugs so it's a very stable one. Good work by the way
<br />
<br />Just for fun Mod. Well this is my favorite Mod, it's have a multitude of changes in single player and still don't messed up the story line. The name spoken from himself and that it's entirely true. It have plenty of ship and weapon, but it's need to be polish it a bit. In the Confederation System the name of the ship and the distances it's not listed good. And have a bug in a Nomad System (The one with the barrier, its a planet over there and if you try to go round the game crash) and in Omega 17, I think (The one were you find Diamonds in the ring of Nebula and big radiation) when I go to take the loot of one shipwreck, something hit me very hard from nowhere, I lost the engine of the ship!!! the power generator and the shield, but I survive somehow and I returned on the station only with thrusters!!! Now I wonder if that can be used some how. I'm pretty sure was a bug because I was friendly with all the faction.
<br />
<br />Monkey Universe. It's have errors and don't let me finish the story line! But I played like an Open SP. This Mod it's not balanced enough, how in the name of God you can beet an Defender which  have 10000Hull with two Justice with unchanged damage! It's so boring to shoot an a ship endlessly over and over again and when you think it's ready to blow up... cruise engine start and  farewell loot!!! 
<br />But have good parts too, is the most animated Universe I found in a Mod. 
<br />It is full of battle between faction and I remember once I get out from an jump hole and I run into a battle with Nomad Battleship, at least I think it was one.... Then load the game because something hit me with something very hard. Only a battleship guns hit that hard!
<br />When it is errorfree I will gladly played more
<br />
<br />BigDaddy StoryLine. Well... if you are not a very patiences person don't install this! This Mod is unbelievable hard, from the very beginning to the end. My first impression was that the Mod it's made from a nut person (no offense, please and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who think that)
<br />But soon I realized  the potential of the game. Everything is made to make your life harder. BigDaddy knows the Game very well and because of that everything was made in such a way to don't let you do anything easy! It have few bugs but already was reported.
<br />PS: I changed my mouse because of this Mod, but I don't want to comment that.!!!
<br />
<br />I downloaded the Tie Universe, so I will post comments next week.
<br />Farewell and don't be shy.</div>

			<div class="content">A note on this subject though. ANY Mod is a good mod, it truly depends on YOUR prefeence. Systems, ships, weps, visuals or what ever you like in a mod. Me, I like ships in a vanilla Open SP game. Others like a total conversion. Each to his own. Like SWAT has pointed out, there really is NO BEST mod. Just what works for you. 
<br />
<br />this said, no flaming or the thread will be locked. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
