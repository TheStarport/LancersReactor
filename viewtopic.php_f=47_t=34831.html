<br />Section 1 Chapter 1 Part 1
<br />
<br />March 17th  806 AS
<br />
<br />Freeport 10 Tau 37 system 08:30h
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Time is 8:30h, This is your Requested wake up time, The Time is 8:30h, This is your Requested wake up time&#8221;, Said the Alarm Clocks Voice.  The time is.... &#8220;Oh Shut the **** up, I'm up&#8221; Replied Arron. As he forced him self out of bed.   &#8220;What should I have for breakfast&#8221; Arron thought while he headed for the shower.  The Quarters on space stations where small, A Bed, Dresser a few chairs, a small Kitchen which had a stove for cooking a sink, a small fridge and a small bathroom with a Toilet and Shower in i,  Arron did not mind it... It was fine by him because it was better then living in Bertonia, and he also did not like the idea of &#8220;Living it big&#8221; so to speak. 
<br />
<br />Arron  Sinclair was born on planet New London into a working class family.  He had Black hair and Brown eyes and had a lanky posture. He would often dye his hair a different colour form time to time for fun.  Both his parents where miners for BMM.   He remembered his Mother and Father always talked about how corrupt the government and how cooperations had all the influence with in the government and the people had no voice, even though  Bertonia was suppose to be a Democratic house, like the other houses. Which was a load Bull ****.  Anyone would who would raise their voice against the corruption in government or the corporations  would be disappeared and never heard from again.  This was not just limited to Bertonia, All this houses were as corrupt as Bertonia.  His parents were barely able to make ends meet because miners were worked long 12 hours a day and paid very little.  When Arron was 14 his father was killed in a Mining accident on Stokes Station in Leeds.  Arron was not stocked at this Miners very few miners live to die a natural death. When Arron was 16 he decided that there was nothing for him in Bertonia, His Future in Bertonia  was to be an over worked and under paid worker,  like his parents and his grandparents.  The only people who had futures were the rich.  So he decided he would leave Bertonia for the border worlds, With the hopes of becoming something.  He remember learning about the Gas miners Guild in school, about there how they beat Rheinland during the 80 year war.  So he Decided to do more Research them. He found out that Gas Miners were paid decent wages and being Gas Miner was  a safe Job. But two things kept him always one was that the Sigma systems were very far away and it would cost him a fortune to get there.  The second reason was that he remembered hearing in the news that Rheinland was building up their military along the Sigma systems and could &#8220;annex&#8221; the systems again.  He did not want to end up being killed in a war over gas.  He also thought of Joining the  IMG. But IMG losses a lot of its miners to Pirates such as the Outcasts. His Mum told him that Outcasts make the Molly's and Gains look like Angels, She told him that the IMG Miners go nuts because of the Outcasts threat
<br />
<br />One day Arron knew where he was going to go.. He was in a New London bar, A place were he should not have been in, and over a transport pilot talking about the factions called the Zoners.  Which lead him to do some research.  He found out that the Zoners were a neutral faction that traded with everyone Regardless of there legal Status.  He also remember read that a lot of people become Zoners are sick of the life in the house systems and want something different in life.  At this point he knew were he was going to go when he left Bertonia.    
<br />
<br />
<br />When he was 18 he left Bertonia for Freeport 6 in the Borders worlds and joined The Zoners. He learned being a Zoner was about accepting everyone who came onto the Station, Didn't not matter weather they where a Navy Hero or a Outcast Drug Runner who had killed hundreds of people in Cold Blood.  He also found out that Zoners came from ever corner of the Sirius sector and every walk of life, Also a few of them where born Zoners and some of them had never set foot on a planet.  What banded the most of the Zoners together was the corruption in the House system, they could not do anything about it., And did not want to hurt anyone if they tried to do something about it  He started off as a worker in the Bio-Domes on the Station he also did some repairs here and there. He did not mind this Job, It was better then being a Miner like this mother and father and a lot safer and the pay was not that bad either. After a while he was able to get some lessons on how to fly a ship, It was ever Zoners Birth Right to be able to fly a ship....  After about 7 months of living on Freeport 6 one of the freighter pilots called in sick, and Arron was offered to be a temporary replacement for the Pilot, and Arron Jump at the chance to do something different.  The Run was rather short and Safe(For Zoners), and did not require any escorts.  It was running supply's to Freeport 10 in the Tau-37 systems.  After the Run to FP 10, Arron sensors detected the wreck armored transport.  It looked to be a Samura transport and was probably  the handy work of the outcasts playing &#8220;Hide and go Seek&#8221; with Transports again, when he scanned it he was surprised to see that their was still some cargo in the ship.  The Cargo was Diamonds, so Arron looted the wreck and took the Cargo back to FP6.  He was able to get 200,000 Credits out of the deal, More then enough to buy his own freighter.  After three years of running cargo between FP-6 and FP-10 and the odd run to Bertonia and Kusari, Arron decided to move to FP10.  He thought it was the one of the most Beautiful systems in all of Sirius and it was very very far away from the house systems. 
<br />
<br />Which bring us to now
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />After he finished shower he got dressed in his usaly blackish clothing, and proceeded to the small kitchen in his Quarters.  &#8220;I think I will have Synth Paste Supplement A7 today, with some coffee and an apple.&#8221; Arron Thought.  As he was about to sit down to eat, his neural net Comm. Rang.  He got up and proceed to the computer panel on the wall.  It was flashing &#8220;Incoming Transmission&#8221;..  &#8220;Hmm,  I never get phone calls, I wonder who it could be,  the only person I get call from his Mum or it could be someone playing a joke on me again&#8221; He thought as he pressed the receive Transmission button.  The &#8220;Incoming Transmission&#8221; Message was replaced by the helmet of an Outcast Pilot, He could make out the face of the pilot behind her helmet and it was Nora.  &#8220;Hola, Arron, Guess what&#8221;,  &#8220;Hey, Nora, What am I supposed me be guessing on this time&#8221; Arron Replayed.  &#8220;Well I found something Interesting&#8221; Replayed  Nora,  &#8220;How Interesting&#8221; Arron said,  &#8220;Lets say interesting enough for me not to talk about over an open channel,  I will have to tell you about the Interesting thing when I get to Freeport 10,  My Squadron will be there in about an Hour or so,  So I will meet in you the bar when I get their, Okey?&#8221; Said Nora.  &#8220;Yeah okey, I will meet you their, This must be quite interesting&#8221;..  &#8220;****ing is. C ya in an hour, Arron, Nora out&#8221;...   &#8220;Hmmm That interesting&#8221; Arron thought...  &#8220;Well I have an Hour to kill, till she gets here&#8221;

			<div class="content">Heres Part two of Chaper 1, I did not feel like Proff reading it, so there mite be a few Grammer errors... Still not much action, but has alot of humour in it<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Section 1 Chapter 1 Part 2
<br />
<br />
<br />Arron walked down the Corridor towards the lift.  Wondering what that inresting thing she was talking, That was so interesting that she could not say over an open channel,  Or was is just an excuse for a date, Arron laughed a bit at that thought, &#8220;A Women interested in me, and an Outcast women for a fact, which is a very scary fact as well&#8221;   Women never showed much interest in Arron, well so he thought.  He rather rather attractive form what he has been told, but he always figured that his crackpot scene of humor that scared women as well as everyone else, or it be that he never lets anyone get close to him.  He also did remind him self that Nora  has a lot of crackpot ideas as well,  but she acted out on them, like when she told him about the time that her squad ran into some LSF agents in the New York Badlands, she said they were able to capture them alive, after integrating them they killed them, and it was her idea to stuff their mouths with Cardamine and dump their body's on the edge of the badlands for their comrades to find them.   Arron remembered hearing about some LSF being found in New York, with their mouths stuffed with Cardamine, when he was 17 on the news.  To think he knew the person that did that.  Arron reached the end of the corridor where the lift was, he pressed the button near the lift.  A fed seconds later the lift arrived the doors opened and he sept in. &#8220;Deck 5, Section 2&#8221; he said.&#8221;  in about 30 seconds Arron was on deck 5 section two, the bar was only a short walk away from here.  Arron walked threw the doors into the bar.  
<br />
<br />There were not many people in the bar,  Two people sitting at a table near the him, they were speaking in some weird Language, it sounded strange, it sounded some what like English but it was not English.  Arron just thought Meh, &#8220;Must have been something they made up so that people could not hear what they are saying&#8221;  As Arron walked over the a table on the other side of the bar there was a man sitting by him self, he looked like to be an IMG Miners, &#8220;Hello&#8221; Arron said &#8220;Hello I'm Willy, what your name?  I mine Niobium, I love Niobium, Its my &#252;ber friend, whats your name,  Please Kill me&#8221; Replayed the miner,  &#8220;I'm Arron, I cant talk, I'm waiting for someone, Nice talking to you&#8221; Arron said  &#8220;Heh Mum was not kidding IMG workers are ****ed in the head,&#8221; Arron thought.  Arron got to his table and sat down, and the Bar Tender came over.  &#8220;What can I get you?&#8221; Asked the bar tender, &#8220;Oh. Just get me a cup of Coffee&#8221; Arron Replied  &#8220;Okey Sir, I'll be back in a minute&#8221; Replayed the bar tender, Just as a news flash came on the TV,  &#8220;Oh, could you turn up the TV&#8221; he asked  &#8220;Sure&#8221; Replied the Bar tender as he proceed to press the Volume Button on the TV.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;..There has been another siting of an unidentified ships spotted in Sirius, This time in the Sigma-19 system. The ship was spotted by an GMG patrol in the system while they were in prasuit of a smaller unidentified ship.  They reported that they made visual contact with the larger ship for 30 seconds while the smaller ship docked to the larger ship,  The pilots in the patrol reported that the larger ship was over two kilometers long, after the small ship docked to the ship, the larger ship seemed to generate its own jump hole and entered it, after the ship entered the Jump hole disappeared.  This is the 3rd such siting of these unidentified ships in Sirius, and also the was the closest these ship have gotten to any of the House system.. A spokesperson for the Liberty government says that they are investigating the matter, he also said &#8220;The government is certain that the ships are not Nomad ships and have not taken any hostile action against Colony ships.&#8221; In later new.....  Anther siting Arron thought, Arron remember another Zoner seeing a ship like that, That was not a Nomad ship, These ships started to appear after the Nomad attempted to invade Sirius, Some people says it a the Dom 'cavash(spelling), Some say its just liberty's new battles ship trying to scare people **** less to that they would buy more weapons from them. At this point the Bar Tender brought Arrons cup of coffee over &#8220;Thank you&#8221; Said Arron. About 5 minute latter Nora showed up and walked over to Arron's table.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Nora was an Outcast, and a rather brutal one at that to...  Nora was 180 cm tall and had a muscular build like most outcasts and black hair.  She grew up living on Planet Malta the outcast home world, and she became a drug runner\Pirate at the age of 16, just like her parents and her grandparents.  She Rather enjoyed the taking the Revenge of the outcasts on liberty for there failed attempt to kill their people of the Hispania off by sabotauged there ship, They were able to catch him while he was trying to get to one of the shuttles on the Hispania, They interrogated him and to their surprise they found out he was working for the Americans, and he was ordered to &#8220;Take care&#8221; of the Hispaina and make sure it would never reach Sirius so that the Liberty could have more Resource. After that there was a split in the crew on the Hispania on what to do, either head to the near by planet that was barely habitual or to continue on to find a more habitual planet.  Half the crew of the left for that near by planet and Became the Corsairs.  The rest stayed on the Hispania and found a somewhat more habitual planet and became the outcasts, The rest in history. Arron remembered hearing in history that the Bretonia had some engine problems which delayed it getting to Sirius, He now wondered after hearing about what happened to Hispania, He wondered if the Americans tried to do the same to the Bretonia.  Nora also enjoyed the blood lust of being a pirate, going around forcing ships to drop their cargo and  then destroying them after they dropped their cargo, or hunting them down.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;So whats this interesting thing, that was so ****ing interesting that it could not be said over the Comm&#8221; - Said Arron smiling.  &#8220;Remember how people said that theirs another jump hole to a another uncharted system?&#8221; Replayed Nora  &#8220;yes, I remember hearing rumours about it, But I hears it way over on the other side of the system and no one  really has the time to go out and look for it or are to lazy to do it,  I even looked for it and could not find it&#8221;  said Arron...  &#8220;Well Guess what I think I may have found it&#8221; - Said Nora happily.  &#8220;Really, How did you find it&#8221;  Asked Arron.  &#8220;Well, My squadron was on patrol on the other side of the system. And I picked something very f ante on my scanners which looked like a jump hole ,  I was able to mark the general area that it was in, before we were jumped by Bounty Hunters, After we delt with the bounty hunters, I was unable to to pick it up again.  I asked the other people in my squadron, if they detected it, but they did not, and said it just could be Senor shadows, I'm prity sure it was not&#8221; Explained Nora.  &#8220;Hmmmm that is interesting, Worth looking into,  But why all the secacys?&#8221; Arron said rubbing his chin with his hands.   &#8220;Well I thought it would be neat that we had something secret between us, When are you going to look into it?&#8221; Asked Nora... &#8220;Well.. I can go out tomorrow,  and I bet you want to come to?&#8221;  Said Arron.  &#8220;Sure as hell do&#8221; Replayed Nora.  &#8220;Good, I did not want to do by my self,  I'm going to have to get a few weeks of supply's for the both of us, In case we find another system on the other side of that jump hole, because it will take us a week or two to chart the system&#8221; Explained Arron   &#8220;yes, and I'll have to get a few things on mine, and two weeks supply of Cardamine, and of course I'll have to go with you in your ship, because of my status as an Outcast,  I'll have to Notify  my superiors that I will be away for a few weeks, Heh, Best thing about being an Outcast you get all the time you want off&#8221;  Said Nora   &#8220;Of course, I should have my ship ready tomorrow at 11:00 hours&#8221; Said Arron &#8220;Okey, Cya then Arron&#8221;  - Said Nora as she walked out of the bar
<br />
<br />
<br />March 18th  806 AS
<br />
<br />Freeport 10 Tau 37 system 11:00h
<br />
<br />Arron thought to him self, &#8220;I hope theres something out there,  I wonder if the system that the Jump hole leads to has a Habitual planet&#8221; as he was doing some pre-flight checks on his Dromedary.  The Zoners have always been looking for a Planet to call home for as long as they have been around, Not just the Zoners there have been rumors that the GMG is looking for a planet to call home as well.  &#8220;You ready to go Arron?&#8221; Yelled Nora from the other side of the bay.  &#8220;Yes, I'm ready to go Just doing some pre-flight checks on my ship while waiting for you to come&#8221; Replayed Arron,  By this time Nora was much closer to Arron.  &#8220;Why are you doing the preflight check outside your ship, Cant you just use the diagnostic system in your ship?&#8221; Said Nora  &#8220;Well..  Back in Ancient times Pilots of Planes would check over the ship on the outside,  I thought I would do it for the hell of it, and to just make sure the diagnostics systems arnt ****ed up or anything&#8221; Replayed Arron,  &#8220;Oh,  Make sense I guess, anyway I got my stuff,  Can you help me load it into the ship&#8221; Said Nora. &#8220;Yeah I guess?&#8221; Sad Arron as he picked up one of Nora's Containers and Carried it up threw the hatch into the ship, Nora did the same.  &#8220;You got a lot of Cardamine here you know,  More then two weeks worth,  You arnt planing on selling  it to anyone we run into on the other side of the wormhole?&#8221; Asked Arron.  &#8220;Nooooo. Why would I want to do something like that,  Drugs are Bad and evil Mmm. K... I'm just bring extra Just in case&#8221; Replayed Nora trying not to give off an evil like Laugh.  &#8220;Oh okey, Lets get going, Shut the hatch will ya&#8221; Said Arron as he activated the Holo Displayed and prepared to start the ship.  &#8220;Yeah Okey&#8221; Said Nora as she press the button to close the hatch.  &#8220;This is Arron Sinclair to Command, Requesting Permission to Luacnh&#8221;  Said Arron.
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;You are Cleared to Launch,  Good Luck out their Arron&#8221; Said the FP 10 Dispatcher.  &#8220;Okey Got the Coordants, and setting the Way point,  Activating Cruise dive,  ETA 3 hours 24 Minutes to target&#8221; Said Arron.  &#8220;Hmm.  We have three ours to kill until we get there, what shall we do&#8221; Said Nora,  &#8220;We could  sing 99 Bottles of Liberty **** ale on the wall&#8221; Said Arron with a smirk on his face.  &#8220;How about NO&#8221; Said Nora.  &#8220;99 Bottles of.......&#8221; as he started to sing Arron felt the Cold Barrel of Daumann 20mm Blaster on the base of his skull....  &#8220;I said no, if you don't shut the **** up I will kill you&#8221; Said Nora in Anger.  &#8220;Okey I will shut up&#8221;  Said Arron. &#8220;Good&#8221; Said Nora as she put her gun back into her holster.  &#8220;You would not kill me Nora,  Not even for something that pety&#8221; Said Arron.  &#8220;How do you know that Arron, I shot a Molly in the head for Snickering at my mask,  Heh. Last time I use explosive bullets, to ****ing messy when you shoot someone in the head&#8221; Said Nora with an evil look on her face.  &#8220;I just know you would not, I can tell by the way you look at me, and arnt Molly's emeny of the Outcasts in the first place&#8221; Arron can tell a lot of things by looking at people and seeing how they react to certain things, it was a hard skill to master, but very useful to him.  &#8220;Damn it, You got me there Arron, and I did not know it was a Molly at the time I thought it was some Junker Spanner&#8221;  Said Nora, At this point Arron and Nora were Laughing.  Arron had never seen an masker laugh before, and was glad that he was laughing with one, and not being laughed at by one.</div>
