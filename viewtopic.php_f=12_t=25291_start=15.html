			<div class="content">u r right Mustang, state health care is no option if u can afford health insurance; it does grieve me to say so as I've always been a big supporter of the NHS and personally I have no reason to complain, I've generally only used the emergency side of the NHS, like when I've had bad accidents or caught foul diseases, but as I get older i can see the time approaching when I'll be a regular customer (it'll be ulcer, arthritis, or prostrate!) and I don't want to be waiting months and years for operations like my parents had to, nor do I want my family to have to wait around for treatment. I signed the wife and kids up for BUPA years ago, only had to use it once but it was worth it (mrs had a cyst in the womb, started pouring with blood one day, A&amp;E saw her but bounced her back to local doc, doc said he'd make an appt. with a NHS consultant in 6 months, so rang BUPA, checked the cover, booked her into the private clinic and she was fixed up in 3 weeks) 
<br />
<br />@Bob, sometimes everything seems to conspire to make life a misery, and it's the little things that can drive u round the bend. just count to 10, count to 10 again, then keep counting; or you'll give urself an ulcer!
<br />
<br />@Chet, yes it is a *****. 
<br />
<br /> ..you think you're done with the past, but the past isn't done with you..

			<div class="content">@mustang - no offence mate but I really can't afford BUPA (as much as I'd love to)....my best mate works is one of the managers in BUPA's head hospital in Manchester, he offered me a 50% discount and I still can't afford it!
<br />
<br />I know I commented on the NHS being ****, but to be honest they've never been that bad with me - its just that one time in casualty really.  Every time my family have been in hospital they've been looked after very well.  Would be nice to see some more money pumped into it obviously, but thats political I suppose so I'm not gonna go there.
<br />
<br />@bob - everyone has bad days, weeks, sometimes even years....my philosophy is, if its not going to kill you, you can only learn from it.  And if that doesn't work, laugh manically and people will feel sorry for you <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">i'm terribly sorry bob.. may i hijack the thread for one reply? thank you, have a nice day.
<br />
<br />[ranti heard there was a talenttime thing today, (fri) so i figured it'll only be super boring(where i was 500% corect but i'll get to that later) so i went to school expecting a test(did i tell you guys that there's only 4 ppl in the entire classs?) well it was a geography test. i studied for it. (did i tell you i am the only person taking geo?) anyways, the in the first lesson(chemistry) the teacher was very lineint(sp?) and let us out right after we got our test results back(70<img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) then we were let out.. only 15 mins after lessson started.
<br />
<br />i went next door to chat with the peeps there (who were also let off) (oh i might add that only 2 ppl out of the 4 came.) so far so good. then i felt a like sore in my throat.. a weak one. havin expereinced the seriosuly serious types before, i went into recover mode and took things carefully(no cold water ..etc) that was the first bad thing - the sore throat.
<br />
<br />bio teach comes in. i ask if we have class today(only 2 ppl in bio and they were present) she says no, anything to ask me? - no - then i'll just sit here-test me on geo pls-what is an ecosystem?-i have no ****ing idea-i'll go now(teacher) - good idea. she leaves. i decide to go to the show again(termed concert from now on) all my friends are there. they, like me, don't seem to be enjoying(note they were the non-korean friends)
<br />
<br />next is geo, i brace myself for the test. teach comes in, - you aren't in the show? - no what about the test?- why? - just don wanna - just go, the cleaners will be cleaning the classes and lets push the test to next week, and so you don't get disturbed-okay i go. only to go to the bathroom about a minute later to pass the same geo teacher inspectin all the bags in both classes(yr 10 and 11 i'm in 11). i ignore them since i got nufink to lose. bad thing -2: no test.
<br />
<br />why the heck did i study the night b4? then, i decide i want to catch up on TLR so i sneaked to the comp room. i'm allowed on comp, since i'm in good books with the comp teach so no probs there. when i come out its about 12pm. i get curious about whats so interesting about this show that turned the school devoid of students.
<br />
<br />i went. i saw. i freaked. seriously it was crap. sounded like (insert the most horrible noise possible here!). then i felt my throat hurt more. friend wants to go upstairs (5th floor no lift) we go up. pant. go into class to be met by a crowd of koreans. i dono what they have against me but they kept badgerin me.. hello kim-you want some cookies?-you gotta eat you're too thin-did you go see the show? its fabulous-bye !
<br />
<br />i go out. abandon my friend there. (some friend huh). then i go in, only to feel my throat even worse. then i go back into the class with the pests only to find them gone. i decide to go there since i got nufink to do now. i go in, i get freaked. i sit down with all the courage i could muster. hell time.
<br />
<br />after that, lunch. i scramble out. eat lunch(served cold today <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) thats bad thing #4. after lunch we troop back in. i sit down in the same seat. then get ushered by some authoirty person (i might add that i got the strong urge to do his nose in) i get stuck with the koreans - don't you just love this? - its eh...-come on! hey, sit here, between me and her!-eh.. no thanks. then this woodwind(they brought in brass instruments - only so wtf is woodwind orchestra when you only have brass?) then they start playin.. 1.5 hrs straight. i pity the conductor. it was so crap and he must have felt so bad.thats bad #5.
<br />
<br />my throat gets so bad i want to kill every one in the hall(yes, we were in a hall, you could just imagine the brass sounding like someone farting for 1.5 hrs straight) after that - i feel slightly better - only to be welcomed by the prize giving ceremony. i pity everyone. especially me. they chose the worst (well they were all worst) ones to get the awards. then friend.. the one loyal to me goes - hey kim, lets sit and watch them replay - no thanks.. i don't feel so good.. i think i've had enuf - oh okay, well go on ahead. i'll catch up with you later - i go up 5th floor. pant. throat worse. bad thing #i lost count.
<br />
<br />i gather things together - all i done today is get my chem paper which was trash.. and nothing else. i get out my compass(knife got confiscated) try to stab the desk. sharp bit goes blunt - bad thing i lost count+1. figures i di'nt hav eto come to school today. throat gets even worse - badting i lost count + 2. then at 4pm i go up (supposed to be at 4:30 pm) i wait - wait - wait - wait - wait. 5pm. bus guy comes. i go back home.. figured i needed whiteout. bad things i lost count + 4 (for the 2 bad stuff) i get him to drop me off at the stationary shop.
<br />
<br />buy whiteout. throat sore goes down to lower arm.. my chest it hurts. i start joggin back home with the bag (3kg today, lightest of the week) throat gets very bad. i go inside house. i shower. get goosebumps all over me. bad thing i lost count + 5. then i sit down. try to get some rest. throat worsens and my entire body aches. bad thing i lost count + i lost count. its gettin worse by the second - bad thing i lost count+i lost count+1. i'm now typing on TLR praying that i don't get flamed by this thread worshippers. - badthing i lost count+i lost count + 2.[/rant
<br />
<br />i know very little of that made sense thats bad ting i lost count+i lost count + 3.
<br />
<br />next episode tomolo.
<br />
<br />EDIT: <img src=smilies/icon_smile_dead.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> i finished editing now down with flames and up with sympathy!

			<div class="content">Geez Kimk... I have to agree with gromit. What I did read tells me that,
<br />A: You had a rather bad day
<br />B: You have a nearly photographic memory
<br />C: No I don't mind if you or anybody else hijacks this thread (ok, didn't get that from your rant) because the weekend is here so I can't possibly be annoyed for two days. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> today has been nice too. Perhaps you got day 3 of my 3 bad days?
<br />
<br />I even got my can of neon red spray paint! Im so happy... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_approve.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle><img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />EDIT2:
<br />next episode: btw, warlord, this is another hijack (sticks up tommy gun) thank you. have a nice day.
<br />
<br />[ranti wake up to find myself on the bed . figured i didn't change/wash .. it becomes a habit so if i don't do it i feel like i have a hangover.. so naturally with a sore body + hangover = bad..bad.. feelin. i wake up to find myself like that at 5am. i crawl to my mum's bedroom. kick her out. its more comfy there. sleep till 9am to find my sis yellin at me.
<br />
<br />wake up, go wash. feels like i'm gonna puke any second if i look down. so i lie down on the sofa downstairs in the livin room. my mum tried to get me to eat cereal. i feel worse. lie back. my sis is watchin chip and dale rescue rangers. i hate that cartoon now that they don't fly with their super cool pineapple aeroplane thing. it makes me feel worse. i decide i need doctor.
<br />
<br />mum drives me out. somehwo the neighbour's dog managed to lodge itself out of the bars on the gate. its yappin at me. i glare at it and get into the car. we get off at a pharmacy where i go into  get the nail files someone was talkin about. get them, drive to clinic. about 200metres away. then... the doc was good. it was a new clinic we went to.
<br />
<br />then we go to tailor's to get my pants fixed. have a shouting match aobut how my pants are too short. the tailor guy and his wife refuses to give in - no dammit.. the pants are too bloody short! can't you see(mum)-no its not..! wash a fwe tiems and it'll get loose! besides, its him(me) we should be listenin to - (me) i told you a gazillion times that my pants were too short! - oh okay..so now you're talking - no dammit i've been talkin for the past 20mins to get the message across your impermeable skull! - okay.. we'll do it for ya. - god dammit finally! .. we stomp off.
<br />
<br />all in all, i feel 6 times worse and thats sayin something. now i find out i have a runy nose which i didn't have about 2 hrs ago when i was at the doc's. life sucks big time.[/rant
<br />
<br />that one was shorter.
