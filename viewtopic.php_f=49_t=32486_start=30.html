<br />The opening line brings back personal memories.... it almost turned me off.
<br />It is very different from your other stories in that you have such a focused first person lens to draw our attention.  But I like what you've done.  Keep going please.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />@Taw &amp; Nick
<br />
<br />Well I will have to confess that one would have to concede that the only war saga worth telling or re-tettling is the Great Utopian War, notwithstanding the despotic shortcomings of some of the parties involved.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_clown.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So it stands to reasons that the chief antagonists from that conflict would recurrently appear in other themes of Armageddon and high mischief.  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">This trip tired me more that I knew. I was getting hungry. My supply ran out a day ago. I had a day still to reach the oasis. My water was fine for now, but I needed to get there soon. The next day, I heard the sound of tools in use. I had made it to the oasis. It had grown a lot in a year. New faces and some familiar ones as well. A scout announced my arrival to the others, who stopped their work and looked up at me. I would guess there were more that two hundred now. Not like the twenty five the last time I was here. This would be a time for news and updates. They had small tents and hut like buildings. Not much to work with in the destruction. I could see several gardens growing, I knew there would be food here. I had a few things to barter. Money was no more. Things that once were valued, became worthless. People were dependent on each other for survival. Me, I was just tired and in need of food. My vision blurred, and I began to stumble and then fell. 
<br />
<br />
<br />A ship, a small freighter, sailed towards the kingdom of Tawakalnia. The skipper had been harbored in a cove with engine troubles and had just survived a horrible three days of high surf. It had swept two men off the deck before he had his ship turned into the waves. Captain Wizard hated losing men and had ordered the battings of the hatches, but these two were still on deck when the first wave hit. Nothing in radio dispatches had warned of a storm. He checked the computer that told him his position was one mile from the port and he looked through the glasses to see the tugs that would guide him in. Nothing. Nothing at all!...No tug, no dock, .......no land! He flipped the switch to turn the radar on, that would tell him if he was close. 
<br />
<br />The scout was speaking to me. Cool water splashed in my face and I came to. I guess I had passed out. Two of the men helped me to a tent to lay down for a bit. The last vision was.....weird to say the least. I had never even been on a ship before. It would take me a bit to get pass this one. I knew I would be here for a few days before moving on. I would help out and work for the provisions I needed. Every so often,a curious face would stop by, looking into the tent. A stranger to them was a new thing. Tales to heard, news to be unfolded and hope to be shared. Some had been too young to remember the war or the cause. Few knew of the Chairman of the Central Committe, Tawakalna and his attempt at a utopian kingdom. Even with the wise one of daftness, Nickless to advise him, he was domed to fail. He had committed too many soldiers to hold the outer area and was weak in his on defence. This much I remembered, though I still don't know why. Rest, Rest is what I need now....sleep....sleeeep...
<br />
<br />Wizard could not believe it. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. Either this thing was broke or he was way  off course. He called the tech to check the system. After an hour, he had found nothing wrong. He even conferemd thier position with the GPS. the were five hundred yards from the port, or where it should have been. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Give me a depth reading Wolfy&quot; Wizard ordered.
<br />
<br />&quot;Three hundred feet, Sir&quot; came the responce. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Monitor it for the next fifteen minuets&quot; Wizard spoke and sat in the captains chair. 
<br />
<br />At the end of the time, Wolfy jumped. &quot;Sir, you better look at this&quot;
<br />
<br />The Morning sun poked into the tent. t brought the dawn of yet of another endless day. Time to move on. But on to where. I had charted many oasis to go to and yet other areas to explore. There were not many like me. Most did not want to risk life to find out they were just alone. I found it a challenge, to find out him I am or who I was. To find my past, what ever it may be.

			<div class="content">it's true, he was my most loyal supporter and trusted implicitly, despite being tempted by promises of scores of hunky sailors available for casual sex,by Mustantopian propaganda (of the lowest kind i might add, our propaganda excelled in virtue)(which is why we won) Locutus proved steadfast in his commitment to the Revolution even after I'd had to erm retire on erm heath grounds to an erm uncomfortable exile NOT A HOLIDAY in the unspeakably hospitable socialist fraterity of Cuba, whereas i was forced to live out my days with only rum, cigars, and dusky skinned latin beauties to comfort me. 
<br />
<br />as for the turncoat, he's the puppet of some corporate gangsters back in Noo Dworkin and has to put up with mutants with their underwear outside their clothes bursting into his office every few hours.
<br />
<br />edit - I still can't get over that &quot;Hidden Kingdom of Mustang&quot; business, i mean that is so unfair, why does he have his own kingdom and I don't? there is sooo much i could do with my own country, and its brutally subject population erm loyal hardworking citizens and socialist brethren.

			<div class="content">And now...the conclusion
<br />
<br />The Morning sun poked into the tent. It brought the dawn of yet of another endless day. Time to move on. But on to where. I had charted many oasis to go to and yet other areas to explore. There were not many like me. Most did not want to risk life to find out they were just alone. I found it a challenge, to find out him I am or who I was. To find my past, what ever it may be. The scout announced himself and let me to where I could get the supples to carry. The pack would be heavy for a couple of days, but I would need all that I had. This trip was five days. Five days alone in the bareness of this world. My thoughts alone to keep me company. This whole thing seemed such a dream....at least until you left the oasis and found yourself staring at endless rubble and destruction. There was a light breeze to carry me the first day. I checked my map and compass and set out. A few people to see me off stayed on the last ridge till I was out of sight. Touching to know some began to care again. Night cam quickly the first day. I found shelter near a rock formation. I strung my covering as a lean-to and beded down for another sleepless night. 
<br />
<br />Wizard peered at the readings. A sharp drop down to 300 yards, and by the looks of it, a rough bottom rather than the sandy one he was use to. 
<br />
<br />&quot;What's our position now, wolfy&quot; Wizard asked.
<br />
<br />One quarter of a mile inland from the port, or where it should have been.&quot; Wolfy replied. He was a little perplexed himself. 
<br />
<br />&quot;What happened to the land&quot; Wizard wondered out loud. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir!&quot; a crewman called out. &quot;The radiation readings are off the scale, we're getting cooked alive here!&quot; he added. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Lay in a course for the NA Coast, now!&quot; Wizard commanded, &quot;Full speed&quot;. 
<br />
<br />What was the sound? I lay there in the dark, listening. Nothing. I looked at the night sky. Holes in the cloud cover showed a dark starry night. Must be about three in the morning. I started to gather things togeather. I might as well get a early start and have some easier walking today. By noon, the rain started again. I got a catcher rigged and took a break. The rain would be added to my supply. The dreams I 've had trouble me even more. It looks like the world has been reshaped, at least some of it. Two hours latter, the rain let up and I resumed my trek. Days blur togeather again. Which one is it now.....How long have I been walking? My map shows I'm near another oasis. Maybe five more miles. The land of Tawakalnia, in my dreams, totally destroyed. What happened? Did Mustangs country finally win the war? What was up ahead? Did my eyes deceive me? Those tall plants, trees? An oasis with trees. Even after a year trees...And a face, That face....from the past......in my dreams....Can it be? Mustang himself?  Then all the dreams were real. 
<br />
<br />Mustang looked up at the lone figure walking toward him. &quot;Could it be, after all these years&quot; Mustang thought to himself. &quot;I though he died long ago&quot; 
<br />
<br />He got up from the table and started toward me. Slowly at first. Then picked up the pace. He hugged me saying &quot;I can't believe your alive, I just can't believe it&quot; Mustang said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I know your Mustang, but how do you know me&quot; I asked unsure if this was not part of the dream.
<br />
<br />Mustang cocked his head to one side. &quot;Something did happen to you then, even after we left Mustangopia&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;The contry had been bombed so much that the radiation made in uninhabitable, we left on the last jet out&quot; Mustang explained. &quot;You were out of it most of the time. Even when we got the news clips of Tawakalna's defeat and the destruction of the land of Tawakalnia&quot;. &quot;His own aid helped to end it all, to end the war.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But&quot; I started, &quot;how do you know me, I don't even know my name or past.&quot; I answered. 
<br />
<br />Mustang through his head back and laughed. &quot; Your my aid, my right hand man, your name is Esquilax&quot;.........................
<br />
<br />Do Not Adjust your TV, you have been part of the Twilite Zone...We now return the control of your TLR to you....Goodnight.
