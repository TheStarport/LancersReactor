			<div class="content">Everyone,
<br />
<br />It has come to our attention that dock camping (killing people as they leave a base/planet before they can defend themselves) is way out of control on the Elite server.  Everyone knows there is no Pk'ing allowed in Liberty space and peopel have been respecting that pretty well.  But this continually killing people as they leave a base/planet for an extended period of time is deterimental to the server, let me explain why...
<br />
<br />It takes two (or more) to tango with this dock camping.  If just two people are involved that takes 2 very valuable slots on the server that others could (and surely would) love to get on and play.  If there's more people involved, then that's just more spots being taken up.  This is not good <b> for the server  </b> in any way shape or form.  You do not own the Elite server, just remember that.
<br />
<br />I've spoken with many people about this issue and it <i> was  </i> being handled by the community as a whole...for a while.  But lately we've been hearing of people being dock camped for more than 10-15 minutes (some claim hours).  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_disapprove.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Well, its all right back on you pilots out there to handle this the right way.  If it's not handled then the server admins (yea, the guys that moderate and own the server) can and will resort to drastic measures if this isn't resolved.  Banning/characters wipes/no more PK'ing at all (remember E2?) come to my mind (as drastic and bad as that sounds) but I don't make the final call, I just interject my opinions...that's all.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Here's the simple proposal:
<br />
<br />You can still dock camp player for 10 - 15 minutes but remember, this is not your server and that time frame is plenty to &quot;make your point.&quot;  Do it, then <b> move on  </b> please.  If you continue to dock camp for more than that, know that word may get around and it will be determintal to everyone if the server admins are forced into more drastic actions.  (see above)
<br />
<br />Let's all just take a deep breath, learn to coexist on Elite and don't take advantage of another player simply because you have a superior tactical advantage for an extended period of time.  Sure, they may be some rouges that still do this but if the CLANS on Elite all adopt this new policy it will spread.  
<br />
<br />(also, please don't post on here so-and-so dock camped me)  We are depending on the Elite community as a whole to take care of this themselves before the server admins ar forced to take more drastic actions.  <b> NO ONE  </b> wants it to come to that.
<br />
<br />Like I always say...thanks for listening...Enjoy!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I counter with another hypothtical situation...
<br />
<br />Dock camping does not get resolved on Elite, admins get tired of hearing about it...they decide to take off PvP for a month.  Does that mean the problem is solved?  Not really in the long term but certainly in the short term.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Look, the admins do not want to make a bad situation worse by doing anything drastic, but the sheer numbers of complaints dictates when we need to step in and try to work with the community to find a solution.  Time to make an attempt on this one everyone.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">---- beginning: i didnt record anything before, until i saw the word 'complaint' ----
<br />
<br />Stinger: there's some complaints
<br />Me: of?
<br />Stinger: apparently, it's about dock camping
<br />Me: the dock camping has already been solved by Bar
<br />Stinger: really? funny, that's not what i've heard
<br />Me: you can view the MSN chat in our forums under general chat
<br />Stinger: no need...let me be frank with you okay?
<br />Me: alright
<br />Stinger: would you like it if someone did that to you?
<br />Me: ahhh.. but would you like someone insulting you?
<br />Stinger: then it's only taking up valuable server time from others
<br />Stinger: trying to get on
<br />Me: i understand where you are coming from because i ran a server myself
<br />Me: that is also true, but admins are not always present when their players
<br />Stinger: insults are bad granted
<br />Me: are not happy
<br />Stinger: would it be better to wipe out all of the accounts and start fresh?
<br />Stinger: i mean this really has got to stop...
<br />Stinger: i think your point is VERY well made after 10 minutes max
<br />Me: hmm i'd have to say i do agree
<br />Me: but i dont really care for when they decide to insult... but i agree
<br />Stinger: i mean this is getting WAY out of control for everyone involved..including NEO clan
<br />Stinger: or any clan for that matter
<br />Me: that is due to this redictulas WP/SE/LD war
<br />Stinger: wars are fine..but even iirl there's 'codes' of war
<br />Stinger: i want you to do me a favor
<br />Me: the non stop dockrapeing code for WP/SE has been put in so far
<br />Me: as long as they don't dockrape us.. we wont dockrape them
<br />Stinger: funny thing is...someone always draws first blood..right?
<br />Me: please explain in more detail?
<br />Stinger: someone did the first dock camp
<br />Stinger: that starts it and there's no end.
<br />Me: i can't honistly say who dock camped first.
<br />Me: but i do imagine us
<br />Stinger: this should be fair for everyone
<br />Stinger: dock camping has got to stop
<br />Me: we've stopped that for about i dont know.. 4 hours now
<br />Stinger: we can always take OFF pvp killing to stop it ourselves
<br />Stinger: but we'd rather the players volutarily do it
<br />Me: well.. then elite would be a ghost town (this is not something to use agesn't you)
<br />Stinger: just the dock camping
<br />Stinger: so be it if it became a ghost town....this dock camping is ruining a good thing
<br />Me: yes, i understand that.. we've got your word.. spread it amongst the rest of the
<br />Me: clans
<br />Stinger: i don't believe you really understand the meaning of this
<br />Me: yes i do, and i fully agree stinger
<br />Stinger: it's all been a free for all for months...but now we're being pushed into a corner
<br />Me: this server is linked to TLR.. TLR is a hot spot, if something goes wrong with
<br />Stinger: as server admins
<br />Me: elite, something goes wrong with TLR
<br />Me: i understand fully and i will give the word to the rest of NEO.. however
<br />Stinger: i understand..but TLR was around long before Elite was
<br />Me: i encourge you to message the other clans
<br />Me: yes, during the SL days
<br />Stinger: i believe we're going to 'try' to let the pilots work this out
<br />Stinger: on their won --[EDIT: i think Stinger mean't own?--
<br />Stinger: but drastic measure can and will be taken if this camping isn't stopped now
<br />Me: agreed, but it isn't entirely our fault
<br />Stinger: not to be the heavy on you.but i know you'll spread the word
<br />Stinger: i know it's not just NEO..(by far) but we have to start somewhere
<br />Me: it kinda makes us look like the bad guys since we were messaged first
<br />Me: BUT its a start
<br />Stinger: NEO is the strongest clan on Elite...
<br />Stinger: i'd think you'd consider it an honor to be asked first 
<br />Me: hmm, i didn't view it as that, excuse my defences
<br />Stinger: there's about 18 clans on Elite...i spoke to you first
<br />Stinger: i'll post something up on the web site about it
<br />Stinger: but bottom line...it has to stop..lead by example 
<br />Me: well i am honored you contacted me first
<br />
<br />
<br />----- end, i didn't bother recording the rest as it was basicily finished -------
<br />
<br />least to say i wasn't contacted in WP's favor, so they still failed
<br />
<br />if you guy's require screenshots of this conversation, i can upload all 24 captures to my server
<br />
<br />500K or bai!</div>

			<div class="content">I dont see the point in dock camping anyway.  Making a point is much more efficiently done in a duel, or some sort of fight where both sides are equal.  If you beat the person, your opponent has NOTHING to say, and your point is made very well. 
<br />   Dock camping put simply is an exploit of a game feature that should have been taken out of the MP version of FL.  There are no reasons for cut scenes in MP. They are there for the single player version so that launching into space doesn't look cheezy, not to provide a period of time where a hord of pilots can start shooting at a defenseless person trying to launch into space.

			<div class="content">Don't dock camp people for 15minutes and you won't have to worry so much.  Just 2 or 3 times coming out of the dock.  Any more than that is overdoing it and is not being a good sport.  Excessive dock camping ruins the game.  I am really suprised that there guide is a 15 minute limit.  That sounds way high to me.</div>
