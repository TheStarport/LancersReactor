<br />
<br />
<br />       &quot;Were hit!&quot; These words rang in Trent's ears, not only were his friends in more danger, but King was also on the Freedom. There was a very high chance that he wouldn't make it. The Freedom began to spin out of controle,  a web of cracks appered on the front window as they were slamming into one asteroid after another. &quot;Everyone, go to your own life-support, lock your self in the cargo bay.&quot; Watts yelled into the back of the ship, Col Sharp was now frantically fidgiting with the controles, trying to get the ship stabelised. The cracks on the window only became longer, and wider, &quot;Oh my God, this is it.&quot; Sharp gasped, The Freedom slammed into a large peice of rock, where the front window shattered, both Watts and Sharp were sucked out of the window into the hard vaccum of outer space. King, Bayre and Max made it to the cargo bay, and climbed into the Armadillo(The small ship with the drill attatched, both Freedom and Independence had one.). King made sure that everyone that was still alive was safely in the Armadillo, then he fired the guns, blowing out a large portion of the hull. King gunned the engiene, and busted through what was left of the hull, as the Armadillo flew away from the wreckage of the Freedom. It caught up with the Independence, and flew into the cargo bay. King had made it. The Freedom fell toards the large part of the asteroid, where the quantum anti-matter hybred bomb exploded. Col Davis cut the ships engiens, as not to alert the Nomad fleet passing right by them. The Nomads could pick up the ion trail, so that was the only safe way to approach the planet. As the Indepencence neared the &quot;planet&quot;, Tucker reactivated the ships engiens. But unknown to them, a Nomad interseptor had just reciently picked up the Ion trail, left by the Independence. The ship landed safely, with small chuncks of rock falling all around them. The interseptor that had found the ion trail had called for backup, and now unaware to the crew, five Nomad battleships were approaching the core. The Armidillo had been brought out of the cargo bay, where the laser drill was activated. Trent saw blue light out of the corner of his eye. He turned to look, where he saw the five Battleships, one ship launched a torpiedo at the crew. There was a loud explosion, and an interseptor swooped down and tractored up Juni and Trent. There was another explosion, Trent could see through the hull of the Nomad ship, they were now flying away from the core. The interseptor hit stardrive and sped away from the nembule that hid the power core. &quot;I can't belive it, they won. The Nomads and the Dom Kavish won. It's over.&quot; Juni said. Trent was still in the floor, with his head resting on his knees. &quot;So its really over, Juni, there was somthing I never told you.&quot; Trent looked up, almost in tears, he said &quot;Juni, I love you.&quot; Juni walked over to him, sat down beside him, and was about to kiss him when there was a violant shaking of the ship. Through the hull, Trent and Juni could both tell that they were now inside the Mothership of the Nomads. The ship phased them through the hull, where they droped into the floor. They were now surrounded by Dom Kavish soldiers, with their guns aimed directly at their heads. Unknown to the Dom Kavish, Trent had activated a smoke bomb, and it was set to go off in 10 seconds. The time passed, and the bomb went off, sending smoke everywhere. The soldiers began to fire blindly into the cloud of smoke, bairly missing Trent and Juni. They both ran down the cooridore, when the Nomads had just realized that they were not in the smoke any longer. They kept running, untill they found them selves in the queen's chamber. The queen was at least 30 feet tall, with a black face, and blue glowning eyes. They had never seen somthing so evil looking, Trent was about to be sick. Just then the queen noticed them standing there. Luckily, there were no guards in her chamber, but they knew that the queen could take them out easly. She shot a lightning bolt out of her hand, barely missing Juni. Trent picked up one of the Dom Kavish guns off of the floor and opened fire on her face. But this seemed to do nothing more than annoy her, she shot another bolt out of her hand, almost hitting Trent. Trent found a pulse cannon lying on the floor, he picked it up, and fired right at the queen's face. This time it looked as if it hurt her slightly, but she was still standing. Trent fired another shot, but this time he wasn't aiming at the queen, he was aiming at the ships power core. All of the sudden, lightning bolts came joling out of the core, some struck the queen, while others just missed Juni and Trent. The ship began to explode, and drifting very close to a planet. The ship began burning in the thick atmosphere, and falling to the unknown planet. The tempature began to rise, as Juni and Trent ran to the docking bay. The found a Nomad interseptor that was not locked, and climbed inside. They fired torpiedos at the door, and blew it open. Fire and heat came inside, where everyone that was not in a ship was burned alive. They launched out and were hit by Nomad fire, the ship lost all controle, and began to fall toards the unknown planet. They crash landed, but the ship held together quite easily, Trent and Juni climbed out, to see the mothership crashing into the ground. They knew that no one could have survived the crash, but the queen did. She began making her way toards them. And there was nothing anyone could do, she was going to kill them, and on one could stop her. This was the end.

<br />Captured Pt. 18: Armageddon
<br />
<br />   The Dom Kavish queen was now making her way slowly to Trent and Juni. She was now ready to kill them both, and no one could stop her. She was now within one hundred yards, and closing in fast. &quot;Trent, I dont think we are going to make it out of this one alive. There is somthing I need to tell you, I really care about you. Not just as a friend, but more than that. Trent, I lo-&quot; Juni was interupted by the sound of a ship's thrusters. But not any thrusters, they sounded very fimilliar to Trent, It was the Armidillo! Both Armidillos! <i> But it can' be, me and Juni are the only survivors. </i> Trent thought. But sure enough, both Armidillos came charging out of the sky, fiering their laser drills at the Dom Kavish queen, who was now only about 30 feet from them. She was hit, and began to topple over. The ships swooped down and picked up Trent and Juni, where they droped them off at the edge of a cliff. The Armidillos charged toards the queen, shooting the machine guns and drills right into her chest. The queen went down, and didn't seem to still be alive. The Armidillos landed, and out of one, stepped Tucker and Davis, out of the other, King. &quot;You didn't think a couple of advanced torpiedos could take me out did you?&quot; King said. Every one had thought that King had been killed 3 times up untill now, but he always mannaged to survive. To everyone's surprise, the Dom Kavish queen stood up again, shooting electricity out of her hands. One of the bolts hit Col. Davis, killing him almost instantly, another bearly missing Tucker. Tucker ran back to the Armadillo and began fiering the machine guns, but to no avale. She shot another bolt, hitting the Armadillo, and Tucker. The Armadillo exploded, sending smoke and debrise everywhere. Trent, Juni, and King were now the only surviving members of the crew, who one week ago, set off on a quest to save humanity. Only three of the original fourteen were still alive, but they were going to die within a few minutes. The queen began to shoot more bolts out of her hands, all narrowly missing Trent. She walked right up to Trent and held her hand out right above him. Trent closed his eyes, expecting death any second, he heard a thoom sound, but he didn't get electrocuted. He opened his eyes to see King in the Armadillo shooting the laser drill at her. King said over the loud speaker &quot;We all gotta die right? I guess I'm the one who gets to do it saving humanity.&quot; King activated the engiens on the Armadillo, lifting it above the ground and into the air. &quot;Juni, Trent, you guys gotta get out of here, the Independence is on the other side of that cliff. If you stay here you will die.&quot; King sped the Armadillo up to the queen, shooting the laser at her head. Meanwhile, Juni and Trent were making their way over the cliff and into the plain. The Independence was landed about 100 yards away, out of sight of the queen. They made it on to the ship, as King was battling it out with the queen. The Independence's engiens came online, and the ship began the take off sequience. The small green light flashed on the console, indicating that the ship was ready for launch. Trent picked up the radio &quot;King, were going. Goodbye my friend.&quot; The Independence took off into outer space, with King saying &quot;This is my job, and if I die doing my duty, then I dont have any regrets.&quot; The radio cut off as the Independence hit maximum speed. It was slow withought the hyperdrive engiens, but it was enough to get them out of danger. King flew the Armadillo right at the queen's head, detonating the quantum anti-matter hybred bomb in the ship's tiny cargo hold. Juni and Trent saw out of the window the planet exploding. King, and the Dom Kavish queen were now dead. The Nomad ships that were closing in on Trent and Juni began to fade, and warp. After a minute, there was no edvience that the Dom Kavish had ever existed. No more soldiers, no more ships, the only thing that was left that proved the Dom Kavish ever existed was all of the dammage that they had caused. Human kind was saved, for now.....
<br />
<br />
<br />This is the end of the Captured series. I will make a sequil, as to when, I have no idea. I don't know what I will call it eather. But there will be a sequial, to finish what the Captured series left unfinished.</div>

			<div class="content">DUDE, killa. That was an amazing story. Solid plot all the way through, and there's enough mysterious material in the story to provide a solid backbone for several sequels. Seriously, that story rocked. Congratulations on finishing, bro.
<br />Oh, and I just had a thought, which I suppose everyone's had at one time or the other. Has anyone seen the movie Titan AE ? Animated movie. The Nomads seem a lot like the evil aliens in that movie. 
<br />Once again, great story killa.</div>

			<div class="content">Yes, I have seen Titan A.E. that movie rocked, and I did get the design for the Dom Kavish and the Dom Kavish queen from the Drej in Titan A.E. Now that I know that some one cares about my story, there will definatlly be a sequil. As to when, I still have no idea. I could use some suggustions on a name though.
