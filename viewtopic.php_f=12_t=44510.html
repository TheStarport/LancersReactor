			<div class="content">does anyone know who the two nanny-state nutters were who complained to the British television regulator, Ofcom, about &quot;scenes of gratuitous smoking&quot; in the Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons, &quot;Texas Tom&quot; and &quot;Tennis Chumps?&quot;
<br />
<br />I suspect they'll be easy to spot, with rolled-up copies of the Grauniad under their arms, a mad, deranged, paranoid stare as they look out for anything that might be even remotely considered &quot;offensive,&quot; and the fact that their children, on the rare occasion that they are ever let out into the big bad dangerous world, are wearing crash-helmets, knee-pads, and cricket boxes just to pop down to the shops.
<br />
<br />All H-B's classic Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons are now to be edited, duly excising any cigar, cigarette, or pipe-related material, in case it encourages watching children to nip out and get a packet of 20 Woodbines or Hamlets. So presumably Winston Churchill's portrait is next, or Van Gogh's self-portrait, or Magritte's &quot;This Is Not A Pipe&quot; (erm which features a pipe, and pretty much nothing else)
<br />
<br />Now of course we shouldn't encourage children to smoke. But neither should we encourage them to lure coyotes off cliffs, buy do-it-youself atom bomb kits from Acme, hit each other with frying pans (leaving their little brother or sister with a flat, three foot wide face) nor to drop anvils on passing strangers, or fooling a vicious guard dog into swallowing a stick of dynamite. Strangely enough, the newspapers are generally free of reports of such incidents, which if one were to follow the logic of the politically-correct police, should be happening on a worryingly regular basis. I wonder why?
<br />
<br />Incidentally, said &quot;policy&quot; is now to be extended to all episodes of Scooby-Doo and the Flintstones. No doubt it will be further enhanced to include all other cartoons and film containing scenes of smoking, in no matter what form (like when the Coyote uses a lit ciggie to light the fuse to his latest Roadrunner trap) - the few that may escape the pc-censors on the basis of &quot;editorial justification&quot; will almost certainly carry a warning for concerned parents stating &quot;Caution - May contain scenes of inhaled fumification!&quot; (and here was me thinking nothing could be crasser than &quot;caution - may contain scenes of extended peril.&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Kind of makes you think what would become of Brief Encounter, or Way Out West, or any one of thousands of film made before smoking became the worst thing since Attila the Hun? 
<br />
<br />&lt;wistful sigh&gt; ah, Tom &amp; Jerry; for any child born after the 1940s they were an intrinsic part of growing up. Back when I was a little Taw, and we only had a black and white telly and just three channels (BBC1, BBC2 and ITV) and our dad used to have World of Sport on all Saturday afternoon thus denying us any chance  to watch cartoons (or anything else for that matter) my brother and I would trot down to the local picture house for the Saturday afternoon matinee with a whole half-a-crown (that's two shillings and sixpence, and you felt rich if you had a half a crown) and watch Tom &amp; jerry cartoons in glorious Technicolor on the silver screen, a Childrens Film Foundation feature about Tommy's Time Bike or some such, and some foreign series about Abdul the Peasant Boy and the Thirty Thieves of Marrakech, which always seemed to start at Episode 23 for some reason. Aftre the magical few hours were up, and we'd spent all the money on Lyons Maid vanilla ice cream tubs and Kia-Ora, we'd catch the bus home and trudge in for whatever muck mum was making with stinky boiled cabbage and pray we might get to watch Dr Who after dad had finished watching the wrestling and done his football pools coupon,* before the Generation Game and Saturday Night at the London Palladium came on.
<br />
<br />in my own case, it certainly wasn't watching Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons that started me smoking; it was the bigger lads who hung around at the back of the cricket pavilion at school who said they'd beat me up for being a ponce if I didn't have a drag. Can't remember any cartoon animals being involved. 
<br />
<br />an additional moot point, linking in with other subjects we've been discussing recently; if smoking is so evil, why do all airport duty-free shops still sell cheap cigs? and if you're not allowed hand-luggage any more because you might be a mad jihadist terrorist planning to blow up airliners with Ladybird colouring books and Crayola crayons, how do you get your duty-free shopping onto the plane at all? And why, if planes are all non-smoking, do the no smoking signs go still out once the plane levels out after take-off? 
<br />
<br />what a wonderful world we live in! I'm just off outside for a cig, anyone fancy joining me? it may be the last chance you ever get....
<br />
<br />(* football pools were how poor people tried to get rich and wasted their money back in the days before National Lottery nonsense.)

			<div class="content">In the US, children are not allowed to smoke, or to buy them. Why not ban the use of them in shows that the kids watch. What I find stupid, is tobacco companys being required to pay for anti-dmoking programs, while stil making the drug. And it IS a drug, don't belive me? Try cold turkey quiting. Very few can do it, and will suffer from withdrawl symtems just like ay other drug user.

			<div class="content">you rotten old killjoy, FD; when i come to your house I'm going to chain-smoke incessantly and make your beard stink like an old ash-tray. you just wait, you Tom and Jerry hater you. I still watch Tom and Jerry, I'll have you know; in fact I was watching my favourite episode only the other day, the one where Tom ties Jerry to a toy train track and sets it off to run over him, and the canary drops the bowling ball onto the track and the train with Tom on it goes straight down the hole. it's the funniest thing ever! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />so c'mon then, seriously now, should smoking be cut out of Laurel and Hardy's Way Out West, where Stan is lighting cigars with his thumb? Should Marx Brothers' films be edited because Groucho always has a cigar? these are classic works of art, made at a time when smoking was widespread, and they didn't encourage anyone to smoke, they just reflected an everyday aspect of ordinary life. If you retrospectively edit everything from the past so that it conforms to modern standards and attitudes, then effectively you destroy the past. I love Westerns - almost everyone in Westerns smokes. Should all Westerns be duly edited to cut out all references to smoking? (bit difficult that one since tobacco was a part of Red Indian culture - I use the term red Indian retrospectively, I know the &quot;correct&quot; term is Native American) What will that do to classics like High Noon, Gunfight at the OK Corral, Red River, The Searchers, True Grit, etc etc etc and so forth? or comedies like Paleface and Son of Paleface? 
<br />
<br />the argument isn't whether smoking is bad or not, it's whether you sanitise the past or not to conform with modern attitudes, something which i believe one should never ever do, regardless of how well-intentioned. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, is it not? The past is what it is, another country, they do things diffrently there, as someone famously once said (can't remember who though) and if you start meddling with it and distorting it, you cease to be able to draw the appropriate lessons from it. 
<br />
<br />small point of order; tobacco, well nicotine akshuly, is indeed a drug, and one of the most addictive and most dangerous too. I read somewhere that the active ingredient in nicotine is far more addictive than heroin, even. And yes it can be difficult cold-turkey quitting, as the Bearded One so succinctly puts it. But despite it's incredibly high addictiveness, nicotine is out of the system very quickly, unlike many other drugs; so actually it really is just a matter of willpower. if you can put up with a few days of craving, then that's it, you're done. All the silly patches and tablets do is just prolong the withdrawal. i gave up for 5 years once, after a week of going around snapping at everyone and eating sweets like they were going out of fashion, I'd quit. Unfortunately, if you're around other smokers or situations where smoking is going on while you're trying to quit, it's consequently much harder to do. i only started again 'cos i went out with a mate who smoked and took one when offered. Althought to be fair, i would give up again if I had to pay full whack for my cigs, they're so expensive now, but as I get my cigs from abroad and never pay duty (the Govt get enough of money thank you very much) then from an economic p.o.v. I have no incentive to give up - yet. Once I've gone through my latest delivery of 2000 Lucky Strikes, Chesterfields, American Spirits, and Camels, i might consider it. Fact is, I actually enjoy it. 
<br />
<br />I'd also give up if I couldn't get my favourite brands, i.e. the American ones, because i can't stand most English brands like B&amp;H, L&amp;B, etc, and Marlboro's are horrible now (yes I know they're American too, but i don't like them.) European brands like Gauloise or Gitanes are just too dark, and the better English brands like Player's Navy Cut and Capstan are very hard to get hold of now, and are really expensive (but then they always have been classed as &quot;rich man's fags&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> The very best are Sweet Afton's from Ireland but they aren't sold in the UK anymore, although i did get a sneaky delivery through from a certain contact in the Emerald Isle. 
<br />
<br />I found a lovely shop in New York that sold a wondeful cigarette called Virginia Slims, mmm they were lovely, but the guys in the shop told me that they don't export to the UK anymore 'cos the stuff keeps being confiscated by HM Customs. Tawakalnistan is of course an enclave within the UK without a means of independent import so all our supplies of life's little luxuries, Sweet Aftons, Chesterfields, Reeses' Golden Cups, and Hershey Bars, have to pass through Crown agents. bah! it's so unfair. I'm going to have to uproot Tawakalnistan to the coast so we can import and export independently.

			<div class="content">Unfortunately, it's not really true that <i>&quot;nicotine is out of the system very quickly, unlike many other drugs; so actually it really is just a matter of willpower.&quot; </i>  While the chemical itself leaves your bloodstream, the effects on your brain are extremely long-lived, if not permanent.  Nicotene has the same structure as one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain, Acetylcholine.  When it enters the body it stimulates the brain in the same way as this neurotransmitter does; in particular it stimulates the parts of the brain that respond to dopamine, the &quot;reward&quot; chemical that is usually released after vigorous exercise, sex or even a good night's sleep, and it essentially makes you feel good.  
<br />
<br />The problem is that the brain is incredibly good at adapting to new situations, and in a regular smoker it will quickly realise that it's firing too many neurons and literally rewire itself to stop this happening.  You could say that you become desensitized to your own thought processes.  When a smoker does try and kick the habit the brain finds itself recieving far too little neurotransmitter to function normally and while it readjusts you generally feel cr@p.  Some exceptionally heavy smokers are physically unable to quit because their brains are so reliant on nicotene it would be more dangerous at that point for them to try and quit.
<br />
<br />After saying all that though I do enjoy a smoke now again, mainly in the pub over a drink, although I'm by no mean addicted.  I used to know a guy who always smoked Sweet Aftons, and I'd often buy packs from him as they were so hard to get and had such a beautiful taste.  Turns out he worked in customs which might explain his extensive supplies...
<br />
<br />If I ever meet up with him again then I'll get in touch... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Why are you so surprised Taw? You know the power that the &quot;PC Thugs&quot; wield in society. It's just another form of censorship designed to &quot;protect&quot; us, but also for accountability. I myself do not, never have, and never will smoke, but as Taw said in order to fully appreciate early television and cinema, smoking is present as it was an integral part of the culture. Besides, children can see smoking on other shows and movies, Futurama, the Simpsons, most of the James Bond movies, etc, etc. Yet these shows and movies are still untouched (but for how long?). Ah well, what can you do?  Buy DVDs I guess.</div>

			<div class="content">what can you do? how about let politicians know that you're NOT interested in their tender loving care! tell your representatives that you LIKE being able to make your own life decisions. tell them that you don't think how much sugar, tobacco, fat food etc you put into your body is any of their goddamned business.
<br />
<br />about the idea of kids smoking because of some movie/cartoon/etc - IF you are a parent, and your kid is more willing to listen to some negatively influential narrative than you, maybe you should be examining your relationship to your child instead of looking to blame the media.
<br />
<br />heres a tip for parents: Don't let your television babysit for you - and if you do, when your child burns down the house just leave beavis and butthead out of it - mike judge didn't hand your kid a lighter, and mike judge didn't leave your 8 year old son at home with your 1 1/2 yr old daughter, you did. Its no different than these supposed 'smoke' messages, except that the end result isn't a 50 year old man with lung cancer and a strong desire to sue everyone in sight but a smoking ruin of a home and two dead children. Love your kids, care for them, and don't leave it to the government or television to protect them.</div>

			<div class="content">a similar subject to this came up between me and my friend yesterday, he said he was thinking about starting because of stress caused by a disagreement he is having with his parents (i can't go into details), I told him that he'll know the meaning of stress when he tries to quit and he's spending $200-400 dollars a month for them. but as far as editing a classic cartoon because it happens to have 30 seconds of smoking in it thats dumb if the children are raised properly they should be able to tell real life from cartoons i've watched every episode of tom &amp; jerry (still do) from the time i was 4 years old and i have yet to even think about smoking, course maybe seeing my uncle with a breathing hole in his throat and watching him suffocate toward his end may have affected me.</div>

			<div class="content">Perhaps Esky could enlighten us about that... it seems that Bugs is a rare breed of marsupial rabbit. 
<br />
<br />Maybe Bugs Bunny should get the ban too. After all, he lies, dresses in drag, causes harm to others, and even used nuclear power to his advantage (in the episode where they used radioactive carrots to create a super-bunny). All this damage to society simply to ask... &quot;Hey.... What's up, doc?&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Man, I just don't understand why they have to put up all of this censorship crap all the time nowadays. I mean, I was born in 1991 (luckily) and watched the last days of the good ol' cartoons and look how I turned out (okay, bad example...but still). I know the many cartoons that featured drunken or drinking characters hiccuping and stumbling around didn't turn me into an alcoholic

<br />@ J Dawg
<br />You pose a good question there. Actually, the little-known fact is that all rabbits have cleverly concealed puches  on either side of themselves. The actual slit leading into the puch is very slim and is very well camoflauged, blending into the rabbit's natural fur pattern. I do know one game that many of the young'uns in Equilaxsitavia is that of &quot;Pocket Pranking&quot;. The game was played by having one rabbit try to sneak some type of object into another rabbit's pocket without the rabbit knowing. Of course the object could be anything. I recall one incident where a rather mischievious rabbit hid a pair of robin's eggs in a male rabbits pocket. Apprently they were about to hatch and he woke up with two newborn baby robins in thee morning.</div>
