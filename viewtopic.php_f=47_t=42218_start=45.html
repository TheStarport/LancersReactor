<br />
<br />Disclaimer: Blablabla (see previous chapters)
<br /> 
<br />        Child of the Hispania, by Sybot
<br />
<br />        Chapter Nine: The Potential Divider
<br />
<br />Alarms were already screaming when Paulo&#8217;s Centurion swung out of the hanger bay. He pulled hard on the controls and the missile sailed just beneath him, blowing a piece of asteroid off of Bruchsal Base. The Bundshuch Sabre that fired it opened up with its guns and sapped a chunk of Paulo&#8217;s shields in a strafing run. Paulo activated his afterburners and dashed to the relative safety of a small asteroid to assess the situation. The battle was focused around the two Cataphracts left outside to guard the base, but some of the Sabres had taken to ambushing Corsair ships as they launched. He tuned into the general channel.
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230;me out here!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Got him!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230;last time I do that&#8230;&#8221; *static*
<br />
<br />&#8220;Get back here Paulo!&#8221; Mendez&#8217; voice cut though the chatter like a knife, startling Paulo into action. He pulled out from behind the asteroid and checked his scanner. Mendez was keeping three Sabres away from one docking port single-handedly, his Titan moving in ways Paulo didn&#8217;t think possible. Suddenly a fourth Sabre appeared from behind the base, slowly winding across the asteroid&#8217;s surface in attempt to sneak up on Mendez. It was working, since Mendez hadn&#8217;t even noticed it.
<br />
<br />Paulo swung behind the other three Sabres and made a strafing run on the surface of the base. The sneaking Sabre was briefly obscured by a cloud of dust, and when it settled a few seconds later, Paulo could see he had hardly made a dent in the Sabre&#8217;s shields. The pilot seemed to be dazed, as the ship sat in place for a few more seconds before springing off the surface and heading straight for Paulo.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just great&#8230;&#8221; muttered Paulo, backing his Centurion away rapidly. A Sabre could be equipped with much heavier weapons and shields than a Centurion. In a one-on-one fight he didn&#8217;t stand a chance. Nonetheless, he had to fight. The Sabre came at full burn towards him and opened fire as soon as it was in range. Paulo did the same, except he put his ship into a spin while shooting his guns. The result was neither combatant managed to land more than a few hits on the other. As Paulo spun past the Sabre he struggled to bring his ship back under control. The surface of Bruchsal was looming. The spin was too wild and the Centurion was hardly the most manoeuvrable ship around. As the asteroid&#8217;s surface filled the screen Paulo gave up on controlling the spin and simply fired the reverse thrusters at full blast. His ship stopped moving forward altogether, leaving it spinning in place.
<br />
<br />Paulo had to work quickly. He was a sitting duck until he stopped spinning and got moving. The asteroid field was spinning dizzily on his HUD, friendly and hostile contacts flying everywhere. He had to ignore it and concentrate on the controls lest he get too disorientated. In the end it only took a few well-timed bursts from his side thrusters to bring his ship back under control. Paulo quickly pushed the controls forward. A few seconds later a torpedo passed through where he had been sitting. The Sabre tracked him with its guns, but Paulo&#8217;s sudden burst of speed had surprised the Bundshuch pilot and most shots missed. Before he had a chance to react, Paulo had managed to speed past and get behind him. 
<br />
<br />Paulo cut his engines and spun 180 degrees to get his guns focused on the Sabre. He was amused to the Sabre negotiating its large turning circle rather than attempting an engine cut turn. This couldn&#8217;t be a very skilled pilot. His neutron bolts sailed through space and smacked into the Sabre&#8217;s shields. Each one did minimal damage, but the constant barrage steadily wore down the shields. The Bundshuch pilot finally finished the turn and began evasive manoeuvres. He also activated shield batteries, much to Paulo&#8217;s annoyance, bringing his shields back to full strength. Paulo knew that he had to get behind the Sabre to stand a chance of victory, so he activated his thrusters and went off to one side of it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Incoming missile!&#8221; his computer squealed. Before he had a chance to react his whole ship rocked violently, though Paulo managed to stay in the chair. Even more alarms began to sound, blaring warnings that his shields were gone. Suddenly the ship rocked again and the engines cut out, leaving his Centurion drifting forward without any thrust. All power had been drained; the Bundshuch ship must have had a Paralyzer Missile Launcher attached.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; Palo shouted, smashing his clenched fists onto the control panel. Until his power plant managed to bring up main power, he was a sitting duck. He managed to transfer enough power to activate his manoeuvring thrusters, bringing his ship around to face the Sabre, which was now almost within gun distance. As it drew closer Paulo, slumped back into his seat, knowing there was no way to restore power in time.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You owe me for this Paulo!&#8221; Juanita&#8217;s voice suddenly growled, startling Paulo. At the same time a friendly contact sped into view, got into position behind the Sabre and started pouring neutron bolts and missiles into its rear. The Sabre gave up its attack run and turned to one side, attempting evasive action. Paulo watched as Juanita continued bombarding the Sabre. About twenty seconds later the engines came back online, along with all weapons.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Time to pay&#8230;&#8221; Paulo muttered, pushing forward on the controls. He quickly closed into weapons range and joined the other Centurion in firing at the Sabre. Under the barrage the Bundshuch pilot could do nothing. In a matter of moments his ship was burning up. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;All craft finish clean-up and return to Bruchsal for debriefing,&#8221; Mendez&#8217;s voice rang through Paulo&#8217;s speakers. As Paulo turned back to the base, he was able to survey the aftermath of the battle. Most of the attacking Sabres had been destroyed and the rest were retreating in all direction. The Bundshuch were outnumbered and outflown, something that not even the superior Sabres could make up for. Corsair casualties were light. A handful of ships, mostly those that had been outside when the attack began, were lost. Also one Cataphract had suffered crippling damage, meaning it would probably have to be returned to Tripoli for the rest of the operation.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you, Juanita,&#8221; Paulo said as he pulled up alongside her ship on the way back. She didn&#8217;t give an answer. Paulo guessed she must still be angry, just not angry enough to watch him get blown to pieces. Along with most of the Corsair fleet, except a few remaining outside as defenders, they steadily filtered back into the docking bays.
<br />
<br />When all the pilots had landed, and assembled in the bar, Mendez stood a table and began his debriefing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Today, we won a great victory,&#8221; he started. A resounding cheer went up from the collected pilots. &#8220;However, it can as much be attributed to the enemies incompetence as our piloting skill. The Bundshuch were relying on their superior craft and surprise to defeat us. They planned to quickly overwhelm the defenders, and then ambush the rest of us as we launched. Finally, I assume they planned to storm the base and retake it. Unfortunately for them, they underestimated our piloting skills&#8230;&#8221; Another cheer.  
<br />&#8220;&#8230;Meaning that they were held off long enough for enough ships to get out to prevent them from ambushing us further.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir!&#8221; a young soldier had come up to Mendez carrying a sheet of scorched metal. He handed over the sheet, saluted and marched out of the bar.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This, however, is the most important thing to have come from the battle. We were wondering where the Bundshuch got so many Sabres from, considering we had believed their most powerful craft to be the Stiletto. Along with the usual Bundshuch symbols, the three Sabres we captured all bear the mark of a group unknown to us. It does not match any of the known Outcast shipbuilders. Naturally, we will discuss this with the Outcast delegation on Crete&#8221; He turned the sheet around to reveal a logo that Paulo had never seen before. It showed the five sleeper ships flying up. In between them was a lightning bolt. &#8220;We are currently interrogating the two Bundshuch pilots we captured. Once we know more, it will be announced. Finally, I want all of you to report to your wing commanders for a briefing on our strategy against Rheinland. Elder Denaer was injured in the attack, so he is unable to do it personally. Dismissed&#8221;
<br />
<br />As he stepped down, the silence broke, and waves of conversation descended on the bar. Paulo didn&#8217;t stay to talk. He immediately left for Botella&#8217;s quarters. However, when he arrived, he was surprised to see two other Corsairs he didn&#8217;t recognise, along with Juanita and the Commander.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sorry Paulo,&#8221; Botella said, looking slightly disappointed, &#8220;a reorganisation of wings means you&#8217;ve been reassigned. Your new wing commander&#8217;s quarters are here&#8221; He handed over a small piece of paper with a room number on. Paulo was shocked, and started building up anger. He backed out of the room before he did anything in rage. The whole time he had been in there, Juanita had been doing her best to avoid noticing him. She probably had something to do with this! He was stewing the whole way, but most of his anger faded away when he found his new wing commander.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Rogelio!&#8221; he exclaimed with surprise, seeing the Corsair he had met on Castile Base lying on the bed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Paulo!&#8221; Rogelio returned the surprised greeting. He stood and gave Paulo and very enthusiastic handshake. &#8220;I had no idea you&#8217;d been transferred to my wing!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;So, you&#8217;re a wing commander now?&#8221; Paulo asked. It was quite surprising considering that they had been the same rank when they had joined separate wings just prior to the attack on Yanagi.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My whole wing bar myself was wiped out when we attacked this place,&#8221; he said, abruptly looking far more saddened, so Paulo quickly changed the subject.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The briefing?&#8221; he suggested. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Once the others arrive,&#8221; Rogelio replied. A few moments later there was a knock at the door. &#8220;Good timing,&#8221; He said with a grin. Two other male Corsairs Paulo didn&#8217;t know entered. They managed to squeeze together sitting on the bed while Rogelio stood up at the room&#8217;s console.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s happening then Sir,&#8221; one of the others asked. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;First thing,&#8221; Rogelio said, &#8220;unlike the others, our mission does not begin until tomorrow. Secondly, ours is of the utmost secrecy. This video of an interrogation of one of the Bundshuch pilots will help explain&#8221; He pressed a button and an image appeared on the screen. It showed a bruised and beaten man tied to a chair, surrounded by darkness.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Who gave you the ships?&#8221; a stern Hispanic voice asked from offscreen.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Potential Divider&#8230;&#8221; the pilot groaned under the weight of his injuries, &#8220;they will stop you&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Where are they based?&#8221; the voice continued. The pilot didn&#8217;t answer. A hand swung into frame, hitting him with enough force to knock him and the chair over and out of view. The camera moved to keep them in frame. &#8220;Where are they based!&#8221; the voice repeated, in a much angrier tone.
<br />
<br />&#8220;N-New Berlin&#8230;&#8221; stuttered the pilot, &#8220;one of the asteroid fields&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Kreuzberg Depot? They are working with the Junkers?&#8221; the voice demanded answers.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No. One of the abandoned fields&#8230;&#8221; At that point the video cut out.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We believe the &#8216;Potential Divider&#8217; is the owner of the insignia that Mendez showed us earlier,&#8221; Rogelio said, bringing the logo onto screen, &#8220;we will be flying with Mendez&#8217; wing&#8230;&#8221; Paulo and the other two Corsairs all looked very pleased with this turn of events &#8220;&#8230;and one other. Our mission is to investigate, and if possible, destroy, the base of the Potential Dividers. We know they have Sabres, so this may be a tough fight. I suggest everyone gets some rest.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Sir!&#8221; Paulo said in unison with the others. They stood, saluted as best they could in the cramped conditions, and marched out.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />There you have it! The next Chapter won&#8217;t be started until after MFT3K episode 2 is done, but I promise rising action, and lots of it, as the Corsairs begin their decisive push against Dresden.</div>

			<div class="content">Hooray, an update. Well not exactly. Another CNS news break instead. Enjoy.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />Interlude 3:
<br />
<br />With all the news from the frontlines, this is the Colony News Service.
<br />
<br />&#8230;at least one thousand dead on both sides. More from Honshu later.
<br />
<br />Reports are just coming in detailing a large incursion of Corsair forces into Rheinland space. It appears that two Police Bases in Frankfurt and New Berlin have been destroyed. Rheinland Federal Police is believed to have lost at least two hundred pilots in the attacks. The Chancellor has made no comment as of yet.
<br />
<br />This is the latest in a long series of attacks that have been overshadowed by the escalating crisis in Kusari. Corsair forces have been flooding the Omega systems and making strikes against targets in the Sigma and Border Worlds. Rheinland is currently on a heightened state of alert, and it is likely that the loss of these two key defence stations will push them into a state of emergency.
<br />
<br />With the massive strain put on Rheinland in their recent war with the other Houses and the dire straits their economy is in, a large-scale pirate incursion may be the final collapse of House Rheinland.

<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />Disclaimer: Blablabla (see previous chapters)
<br /> 
<br />        Child of the Hispania, by Sybot
<br />
<br />        Chapter Ten: Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology&#8230;
<br />
<br />So here they were. Eight men against whatever the Potential Divider could throw at them. As the two four-man wings wove through the asteroid field in New Berlin approaching the suspected location of the PD base, they discussed strategy.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We should move in, destroy any bases or transports, then pull out,&#8221; Mendez said, taking charge as usual.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What if they operate out of fighters though?&#8221; Rogelio, commander of Paulo&#8217;s wing, replied, &#8220;we should sweep the whole area to make sure they&#8217;re completely dealt with.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;It all depends on numbers. If we come up against a whole fleet of ships, we will have to withdraw at the first opportunity. There is also the problem of Rheinlanders from Planet New Berlin investigating. We shouldn&#8217;t stick around.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Rogelio conceded to Mendez. They have held the same rank, but Mendez&#8217; seniority was undisputable, &#8220;but if the opportunity presents itself&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I will make sure to inform you,&#8221; the senior Corsair interrupted. Paulo tuned out from their conversation and instead focused on the reply Menito had left him. The previous night he had sent a message back to Crete giving Menito a heads up about the Corsairs wanting to talk to them about Sabres being flown by the PD. A flick of a switch activated the recording. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230;Potential Divider, eh?&#8221; Menito looked liked he was pondering. He took a sip of an orange-tinged drink that was probably laced with Cardamine. &#8220;Hey! I remember now. We had an encounter with them a couple of years ago. They were supplying weapons to the IMG in Tau-31. They seemed to stop after we gave up our plans for a base there and we haven&#8217;t seen them since. They probably use Sabres to incite conflict between us. But, hey, seeing as we&#8217;ve sold the plans to other factions before, they could have got them from anywhere. Anyway, enough of that, I want to tell you more about the negotiations. My father, the esteemed Don Tieren&#8230;&#8221; Paulo switched off the message at that point. The Potential Divider had links as far away as the Tau Systems, and yet had somehow managed to stay off the radar for all this time. He train of thought was interrupted by a frantic message from one of Mendez&#8217; wing, a boy slightly younger than Paulo, who was on point for the rest of them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve got two large contacts, sir!&#8221; the young Corsair exclaimed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Report,&#8221; Mendez was incredibly calm by comparison.
<br />
<br />&#8220;One Gunboat, unknown class, one Battleship, Osiris Class,&#8221; the Corsair responded.
<br />
<br />&#8220;An Osiris&#8230;I&#8217;ve always wanted to get close to one of those,&#8221; muttered Rogelio, sounding far away.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Stop fantasising, and get back on track,&#8221; growled Mendez, &#8220;I&#8217;m more concerned with what a Libertonian Battleship is doing out here&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Liberty is behind the PD?&#8221; mused Paulo.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Liberty aren&#8217;t the only ones with an Osiris Class&#8230;&#8221; another of Mendez&#8217;s wing said, his voice trailing off as they all realised the implications.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That bunch of terrorists!&#8221; exclaimed Mendez incredulously, &#8220;what do they want with us?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir!&#8221; the young pointman chirped up again, &#8220;I can confirm that it is THE Battleship Osiris&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Mendez said, his voice hardening, &#8220;all Titans prepare torpedoes, we&#8217;ll make The Order pay for messing with us!&#8221; Only Mendez&#8217; group were in Titans, but still Paulo checked over his weapons. He couldn&#8217;t believe The Order was behind it. Despite the medias portrayal of them as vicious murderers, the rumour was that they had stopped an incursion by aliens while the rest of the Houses were focused on Rheinland.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ve been spotted!&#8221; one of Paulo&#8217;s wing suddenly shouted, &#8220;there&#8217;s at least twenty Daggers closing at cruise speed. They&#8217;ll hit us in thirty seconds!&#8221; Paulo quickly scrambled to the controls.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir! The Osiris&#8230;&#8221; spluttered the pointman. Paulo looked over to see the Battleship fading into the background as it activated its cloaking device.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; Mendez yelled in anger, &#8220;Rogelio, take your wing and get rid of those Daggers. We&#8217;ll deal with the Gunboat&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Rogelio replied. A beep indicated him switching to communicate only with the rest of the wing. &#8220;Form up on me. The odds are five to one, but these Daggers are pitiful compared to us. We can take them!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes Sir!&#8221; Paulo and the other two pilots replied eagerly. The quartet of Centurions swung away from Mendez&#8217; wing and locked onto the approaching swarm of PD ships. Paulo took his assigned position on the left of the group and focused on his opposite number in the opposing fleet. The Daggers simultaneously deactivated their cruise engines. They approached on another.
<br />
<br />Suddenly the space between them exploded as missiles and energy blasts were spat out by both sides. Four Daggers exploded almost instantly, having the misfortune to be the Corsairs initial targets. The two groups collided. Paulo pulled left avoid the Daggers barrelling past, using the brief respite to activate shield batteries to fix up the damage the frontal attack had done. No sooner had he done that than his ship shook as energy blast smashed into its rear. The superior manoeuvrability of the smaller Dagger was going to be a problem, but he would have to live with it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Paulo! Execute plan &#8216;Close Shave&#8217;!&#8221; Rogelio ordered with grim determination. Paulo didn&#8217;t need to respond. He twisted the Centurion off at a ninety-degree angle, leaving the second volley from his pursuers to sail uselessly into the void. Somehow Rogelio had managed to fly several kilometres away, but now he was rapidly approaching on a direct course to Paulo. Paulo did exactly the same thing, turning and activating his thrusters. As they got closer Paulo could make out two Daggers frantically trying to keep up with Rogelio&#8217;s Centurion. As they got within two kilometres Paulo&#8217;s finger began to hover over the missile launchers. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Lock achieved!&#8221; Paulo&#8217;s computer announced, along with a symbol on the HUD flashing over one of the Daggers. Paulo nudged his ship a few degrees to the left. The two Corsairs drew closer and closer, completely ignoring the barrage of fire from their respective pursuers. Then they met, and passed within metres of one another. Within seconds Paulo had fired off a pair of missiles into the first Dagger, sending into a death spiral out of sight. He immediately turned on the other with his guns, quickly breaking through its shields and vaporising the cockpit, leaving the rest of the ship to float apart silently.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Shaved clean!&#8221; Paulo declared happily, as he spun his ship round back towards the main furball.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Smoother than a babies behind,&#8221; Rogelio chuckled. Paulo noted with satisfaction that the attacks from behind had stopped. He checked the situation and saw that there were only about a dozen Daggers left, and the others were doing a fair job of containing them. Suddenly alarms started blaring as Paulo&#8217;s shields rapidly collapsed. He twisted out of the line of fire and cut his engines, turning to face the attacker. The Dagger that had jumped him was firing anti-shield pulse weapons. One missile and a flurry of weapons later, and the Dagger was gone. He opened communication.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Watch out for pulse weapons, if they combine that with something to crack your hull&#8230;&#8221; he trailed off when he saw several Daggers doing just that were swarming one of his wingmen.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I can take them!&#8221; the pilot yelled, dodging wildly through missiles and pulse fire.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hold tight, I&#8217;ll get them off you!&#8221; Rogelio replied. Paulo followed his friend&#8217;s Centurion into the swarm. Together they annihilated two Daggers before they knew what was hitting them. Then tragedy struck. A lucky missile exploded next to their wingmate&#8217;s ship, sending him barrelling into, shieldless and missing a wing, into a hail of laser fire. He didn&#8217;t stand a chance.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; screamed their other wingmate, Juan, who Paulo believed was a close friend of the victim. The pilot didn&#8217;t bother to evade as a Dagger flew right in front of him. The two collided in a fantastic light show as the two craft&#8217;s shields interacted. It continued for a few seconds before the Dagger&#8217;s inferior shields collapsed. The Centurion ploughed on unabated and tore through the fighter, leaving little more than a debris cloud. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;They&#8217;re retreating,&#8221; Rogelio noted. He was right. The four remaining Daggers were now dodging and weaving in the direction of the Gunboat. The three Corsairs quickly activated their thrusters and chased them down, but the smaller ships were too fast, and they steadily got further and further away.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Get back here and fight!&#8221; screamed Juan as he fired fruitlessly after the survivors. They continued the pursuit and rapidly arrived at the Gunboat. The first thing Paulo noticed was that it was unlike any ship he had seen before. It was shaped lie a cuboid with rounded edges, tapering off to a point at its stern. Wings jutted out on in four directions from the central section. Its surface had a sleek metal shine, except in a few places. One was the front, which had a tinted window, not unlike ordinary craft, and at several other places along the hull and wings, where a concave dish could be seen embedded in it. Somehow the metal hull was twisting, allowing the dishes to track Mendez&#8217; wing of Titans. That was the second thing Paulo noticed. He could only make out three of the original four Titans, and the ship&#8217;s shields harmlessly absorbed any shots they fired.
<br />
<br />&#8220;About time you got here,&#8221; Mendez growled. Paulo was able to pick out the Commander&#8217;s Titan, as it was the one wildly swinging around the Gunboat and yet firing constant volleys. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m going in!&#8221; announced Juan. He pushed his Centurion ahead of Rogelio and Paulo even as they drew into weapons range.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No!&#8221; Rogelio yelled, &#8220;get back, we don&#8217;t know what that thing can do!&#8221; While Rogelio tried to convince Juan not to suicidally charge the Gunboat, Paulo noticed one of the dishes twisting on the hull to track Juan&#8217;s Centurion. Suddenly there was an energy build up in the dish.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look out!&#8221; Paulo tried to warn him, but it was already too late. A thin beam of energy, invisible except for Paulo&#8217;s computer highlighting it on the HUD, lanced out and hit Juan, seemingly ignoring his shields completely. The beam swept through, slicing the Centurion in half, leaving two pieces, leaking atmosphere and debris, drifting lifelessly in space.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Such power&#8230;&#8221; muttered Rogelio, as his Centurion blazed past the beam and debris. The dish moved and began tracking Rogelio instead. &#8220;I want one of those ships!&#8221; he announced, even as the beam stabbed into his main reactor, leaving his Centurion to explode in massive fireball.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No!&#8221; Paulo screamed, seeing his friend die in the fires of his ship. He was numb with shock. He sat back in the seat, paralysed with the sudden loss of his friend. He didn&#8217;t even notice as the dish focused on his ship, swinging the beam to destroy him. It barely missed, instead severing his left wing. The dish swung back round for another pass and still Paulo sat there, oblivious to his rapidly approaching destruction. He could barely make out a voice in the back of his mind, or was it the comm.?
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230;move!&#8221; A torpedo exploded just a few metres away from his ship. The shockwave blew Paulo out of his seat, finally knocking him to his senses. Out of the cockpit he could see the Gunboat&#8217;s beam pass through where he had been just moments before. Just then the beam fizzled out. Paulo got up and turned his ship back to face the Gunboat. He could see Mendez battering the dish that had been targeting him. His sensors showed that the Gunboat&#8217;s shields were finally weakening after the incessant bombardment of Mendez&#8217; wing. He realised Mendez was the one who used the torpedo to knock him to safety.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Th-thanks,&#8221; he stuttered.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about,&#8221; Mendez replied quickly, &#8220;now help us out here, I think we&#8217;re getting somewhere.&#8221; Paulo&#8217;s eyes hardened. He&#8217;d take down this ship, for Rogelio and everyone else it had killed. He pushed the ship forward even as he sat back down in his seat. The three Titans were now taking full advantage of the enemy&#8217;s weakness, concentrating their fire on the dishes that fired the deadly energy beams. Most of the dishes were now damaged, but those that were intact continued firing beams in attempts to destroy the Titans.  However they were keeping too close to the Gunboat&#8217;s surface for the dishes to track.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m going in,&#8221; Paulo said with cold calm, not caring whether the others paid any attention. He lashed out with his guns. The Gunboat&#8217;s shields briefly flared up before the bolts began to pass straight through, sending small pieces of hull flying with each impact. Just as he was preparing to fire missiles, he noticed only one launcher was displayed on his HUD. The other must have been lost with the left wing. Shrugging it off he launched just one missile. It sailed through space and exploded on the surface of the enemy ship, tearing a sheet of hull metal from the surface, exposing the ships innards. Paulo tried to get a look inside, but he flew across the Gunboat&#8217;s surface too fast to see anything.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir!&#8221; one of Mendez&#8217; wingmen said suddenly, &#8220;I&#8217;m picking up gravitational distortions coming from the front!&#8221; After passing underneath one of its wings, Paulo swung his ship round to face the front of he Gunboat. The space nearby seemed to be getting distorted as the light passing through was bent by intense gravity.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then do something about it you <i>idiota de mierda </i>!&#8221; Mendez replied harshly. He was already charging towards the source of the distortions, firing everything he had. Paulo noticed something. A small ball of light was growing about one kilometre away from the Gunboat. He reached for the communicator.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mendez, watch out for&#8230;&#8221; he started, still staring at the mysterious object. Then it exploded. The light was too bright. Paulo shielded his eyes but still, he lost vision for a few moments. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;My eyes!&#8221; screamed one of the other Corsairs.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m getting new readings!&#8221; the pilot who originally noticed the distortions said. He was probably not looking at the light when it happened. Paulo blinked as his retinas slowly recovered from the splodgy aftermath of the brightness. When he could finally make out the Gunboat, he realised it was accelerating away surprisingly fast. Looking ahead he saw where it was heading. He couldn&#8217;t help but gasp at it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;A&#8230;a jumphole!&#8221; he exclaimed. The few surviving PD Daggers, who had been hiding while the Corsairs engaged the Gunboat, reached the Jumphole first, disappearing in a flash of light.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mendez!&#8221; cried one of the others. Paulo looked for the Commander, and saw him, spinning without power towards the Jumphole. &#8220;The jumphole!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; Mendez sounded exasperated.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; asked the other member of Mendez&#8217; wing. Paulo didn&#8217;t bother add to the conversation. Instead he was speeding past the Gunboat, trying to get a lock on Mendez with his tractor beam. He only needed a few more seconds until&#8230;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Collazo! Look out!&#8221; the voice of one of the other Corsairs suddenly filled the cockpit. Paulo instinctively pulled the ship to the left, just in time to watch one of the wings of the Gunboat pass through where he had just been. The enemy ship had picked up speed faster than he anticipated. He could only look on in horror as it smacked into Mendez&#8217; Titan.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just great,&#8221; Mendez muttered. Then he was gone, dragged into the jumphole by the Gunboat. They disappeared in a flash of light. Paulo launched his Centurion foward as fast as he could, but the jumphole collapsed mere moments after the Gunboat had left, too quickly for him to do anything. Then they were alone. The two Titans and Paulo&#8217;s Centurion, drifting aimlessly through space.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So&#8230;what now&#8230;&#8221; one of the others said, sounding dazed. Paulo didn&#8217;t reply.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />Nothing like killing a couple of characters to make it interesting again. All sorts of weird stuff going on here: the Order, &#252;ber weapons and shields, and artificial jumpholes. All this and less may or may not be solved in possible later chapters. I&#8217;ll see you then. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />
<br />Disclaimer: Blablabla (see previous chapters)
<br /> 
<br />        Child of the Hispania, by Sybot
<br />
<br />        Chapter Eleven: A Traitor in the Midst
<br />
<br />Paulo slouched back in his seat. It had been nearly a day since he had arrived at the newly acquired Kreuzberg Depot with what was left of the attack force. He had been stuck in debriefing for hours, explaining to various Elders and Commanders everything that he saw; from the Order&#8217;s flagship, to the advanced warship, to Mendez&#8217; disappearance into the jumphole. He sat and contemplated in sadness, one of his friends, and the man he had looked up to during the weeks the campaign had been going on, were gone. 
<br />
<br />Obviously, he wasn&#8217;t the only one affected. Many had looked up to Mendez as the kind of Corsair they should all strive to be, and his disappearance was a massive hit to morale. Luckily, the war was almost over. Corsairs were raiding targets throughout all the Rheinland systems, Frankfurt was under complete Corsair occupation, and the remaining Police forces were hiding out on their planets, which the Corsairs left alone without the forces necessary to occupy even one. The only remaining obstacle was the primary target, the Red Hessian headquarters in Dresden. 
<br />
<br />Paulo&#8217;s mind wandered back to his first day as an adult, flying out to the cloud to face the Rite. At that point he had no idea that just a few weeks later he&#8217;d be in the capital system of Rheinland, on the verge of wiping out the Corsair&#8217;s greatest enemy. He downed the rest of his drink; something surprisingly good called a &#8216;Sidewinder Fang&#8217;. It burned his throat, causing a coughing fit.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Another one,&#8221; Paulo gasped, putting the glass down on the table in front of him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; a waiter said, taking the glass and heading over to the bar. Paulo noted he was Hispanic. He had heard the bartender on Bruchsal was executed shortly after Paulo had left, for conspiring with the Potential Divider. The Elders weren&#8217;t taking any chances this time.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Any chance of a seat?&#8221; a male voice interrupted Paulo&#8217;s train of thought.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Paulo replied without looking at the man and the chair next to him squeaked on the floor as it moved.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So, Paulo&#8230;&#8221; the man started.
<br />
<br />&#8220;How do you know my name,&#8221; Paulo interjected rudely. He looked over and embarrassment suddenly gripped him. He was looking into the eyes of Elder Villanueva. &#8220;Elder!&#8221; he stammered, managing to sit up straight with a shaky salute.
<br />
<br />&#8220;At ease, Paulo,&#8221; Villanueva responded with his own salute. Paulo slouched back down. &#8220;I need to talk to you, alone.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why?&#8221; Paulo asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;When we get out of here,&#8221; Villanueva answered. Paulo waved away the waiter approaching with his drink and stood.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We better get going then.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />They left the bar and headed to the unoccupied storage area of the Depot. They entered a room filled with barrels of hydrocarbons. Though he trusted Villanueva, Paulo remained wary. When they stopped, a good ten-minute walk away from the major populated areas, the Elder got out a small device. It glowed blue briefly, and he put it back in his pocket.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Short range EMP,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want anyone monitoring this, not even the other Elders&#8221; Paulo had finally had enough of this.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s going on!&#8221; he demanded.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think that there may be a mole in the North Fleet, probably working for this &#8216;Potential Divider&#8217; group which has sprung up to oppose us.&#8221; Paulo waited until Villanueva finished before commenting, his mind full of questions.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why are you telling me about this?&#8221; was his first.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You are the last person left for me to trust here in the North Fleet, all the others have been killed in action. When you left Bruchsal two days ago, there were just five people left I could talk to safely; you, Mendez and three others. Those three died in battle here in New Berlin, and you know what happened to Mendez.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221; Paulo mumbled. The situation was very confusing and he was having trouble taking it all in. &#8220;Then&#8230;how do you know you can trust me?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;The only reason you&#8217;re here is because you were on Freeport 9 when we took it. The PD had no way of knowing that would happen, so they couldn&#8217;t have recruited you&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine, so what makes you think someone is spying on us from within?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;A number of coincidences, for example the GMG fleet conveniently placed just a few minutes away from Yanagi when we attacked. Also, the unexpectedly well equipped Bundshuch. It&#8217;s as if someone knew our plans and reported them, giving the enemy time to prepare. I suspect an Elder, or at least one of the Commanders, but it could be anyone who knows our movements, right down to the pilots&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; Paulo had listened to it all and was now adamant that he must do everything he could to help.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I need someone to command the fighter escort in my next mission.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Command!&#8221; Paulo was shocked. He had only been a pilot for the past few weeks, and he believed he had no chance of being able to lead a wing of fighters.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Paulo, I believe that you have it in you. I need someone I can trust leading them. It would be bad if someone working for the PD lead them, in the perfect position to kill me&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221; Paulo swallowed and pulled himself up straight. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it. What&#8217;s the mission?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We need neutral ground for the peace negotiations with Rheinland once the Hessians are dealt with. We&#8217;ll be removing the Rheinland presence from Bonn Station, Interspace Commerce&#8217;s base in Rheinland. I will be onboard the Cataphract <i>Byzantium </i>, and the <i>Belisarius </i> and <i>Adrianople </i> will be leading the boarding operation. You will command three wings of Centurion running escort duty, and another, a Commander I suspect of being the mole, will command four wings of Legionnaires on interception against enemy bomber. If we get ambushed at Bonn, it must be because of him.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll get right on it,&#8221; Paulo replied. He turned to leave.
<br />
<br />&#8220;One last thing&#8230;&#8221; Paulo paused, and glanced back at Villanueva. &#8220;The other pilots believe we a raiding The Ring, we&#8217;ll change plan in space. Do not tell anyone anything of this conversation&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Got it!&#8221; Paulo saluted and marched out of the storage room.  
<br />
<br />Four hours later, Paulo was in the hanger bay. Thanks to the more powerful transmitter on Kreuzberg, he had been able to get a live communication with Menito back on Crete for an update on the investigation into the PD. Apparently two PD agents had been located in the shipyards on Malta, and were already being interrogated. In return, Paulo told Menito about Villanueva&#8217;s belief that there was a mole in the North Fleet, and his plan to take Bonn Station while investigating the loyalty of the of one of the Commanders.  
<br />
<br />Now he was waiting for his eleven wingmen to assemble. Most were there, but a couple were late. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll begin then,&#8221; Paulo said. The other pilots were looking at him rather disdainfully. They were all older than he was, and they probably resented him for getting a promotion before they did. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Sir!&#8221; one of them shouted sarcastically, with a sloppy salute. Paulo frowned, but otherwise ignored him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We will be escorting the <i>Byzantium </i>, <i>Belisarius </i> and <i>Adrianople </i> in an attack against The Ring. <i>Belisarius </i> and <i>Adrianople </i> will be loaded with troops, who are to storm the station and grab what valuables they can. We are their fighter screen. Four wings of Legionnaires will be flying interception. Good luck, lets gets going.&#8221; He tried his best to sound confident, but it was very stressful being in front of those who don&#8217;t respect you.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Sir,&#8221; the pilots intoned, with the least enthusiasm they could. They got up a slouched off towards their ships. Suddenly Paulo heard clapping. Out of a dark corner stepped Botella.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Commander!&#8221; Paulo exclaimed in surprise, hastily saluting. Despite his promotion, he was still below Botella in rank.
<br />
<br />&#8220;At ease, Paulo,&#8221; Botella said with a smile, &#8220;congratulations one your first briefing, though I&#8217;m still not sure on the Elder&#8217;s motives behind the promotion&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you, Sir, but may I ask, why are you here?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll be leading the Legionnaire wings, of course&#8221; At these words from Botella, Paulo almost stumbled back. He barely managed to keep from blurting out Villanueva&#8217;s suspicions. How could Botella be a traitor?
<br />
<br />&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Paulo replied with a forced chuckle.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Seeing as my wing usually flies Centurions, they&#8217;ll be with you for this operation. See you in space!&#8221; Botella then left for another hanger, leaving Paulo alone.
<br />
<br />&#8220;His wing&#8230;&#8221; Paulo thought to himself, &#8220;but that means&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hello Paulo,&#8221; Juanita said coldly, marching through the door with one of Botella&#8217;s other wingmen behind her. She glared at Paulo the whole time until she walked out of sight towards the ships. The other pilot shrugged at Paulo and followed her.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is going to be an interesting mission,&#8221; Paulo muttered. He jumped down from the crate he had been standing on and left for his Centurion.
<br />

<br />And now to end on a sad note: I have decided to discontinue MFT3K. See that thread for more details.</div>

			<div class="content">Sorry, but this is dead. My big problem was that I had no idea where I was headed, and was basically making stuff up on the fly, which gave me many plot points which I couldn't figure out the how or why for. 
<br />
<br />On top of that, I basically stopped playing FL and coming here (I'm only back to pick up my MFT3K fic, which I deleted from my comp by accident). I've got too much going on at the moment to even consider reopening this commitment. Between uni, two other fics elsewhere and a important position in a guild in an online game I have very little effort to devote to this. Again, sorry.
<br />
<br />Email me if you want to know about my fics elsewhere, as I probably won't be coming back again.</div>
