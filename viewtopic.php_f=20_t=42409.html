			<div class="content">Hoping someone here can help me. I've also posted this on the CF forums but I thought a lil more coverage might be useful.
<br />
<br />Below is a few copy/pastes of my posts to give you an idea of what's been going on. 
<br />
<br />Here we go.....
<br />
<br />copy of post ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br />&quot;prob with 1.56 and 1.57 on SP and MP 
<br />
<br />Last night I tried multiplayer for the first time and was being helped through the custodian gate at Rochester. Unfortunately every time I tried to go through my system seemed to hang. F1 didn't work, Alt+Tab didn't work, neither did Ctrl+Alt+Del. When I finally rebooted my computer and logged back in I was about 70k from the custodian gate still in the NY system. 
<br />
<br />I tried turning off 3D sound and tried a few more times with the same result. I then tried this in the Single Player version and had the same prob with the custodian gate. When I deactivated 1.57 and (also had to deactivate 1.56) I got an &quot;Error: problem deactivating 'Crossfire Mod 1.56 Client Edition'&quot; message and in the log a whole heap of &quot;Warning: SHDeleteFile failed: blah, blah blah&quot; messages. 
<br />
<br />After re-activating 1.56 only I tried the custodian gate again and got through fine. However when I tried the jump gate to X-3043 my computer crashed to desktop suddenly while in the middle of the warp. 
<br />
<br />Anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening? I really want to use this mod on SP and MP and would like to know how I can fix this. 
<br />
<br />Any help appreciated. 
<br />
<br />Samothraki 
<br />
<br />Edit: Forgot to mention that I also have the Unofficial Patch 1.4 installed. This was before I started using this mod. Don't know if this is helpful or not.&quot; 
<br />end post ----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />I then got some help from another member about fully uninstalling the game and re-installing....the lil guide I've posted below, then followed by my reply.
<br />
<br />copy of post -----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />1. Write down your FL MPID 
<br />2. Delete the crossfire mods with the FLMM 
<br />3. Delete FLMM 
<br />4. Delete FL 
<br />5. Delete everything that is still present in your FL dir (normally \Microsoft Games\Freelancer ) 
<br />6. Delete your savegames from &quot;my documents&quot; 
<br />7. Re-install FL 
<br />8. Re-install FLMM 
<br />9. Re-load crossfire mod 1.56 in FLMM 
<br />10. Close FLMM after loading 1.56 and load 1.57 in FLMM. It should give a warning that things will be overwritten, answer them with &quot;OK&quot; 
<br />10b. Install the SP add-on 
<br />11. Activate the Crossfire mod 
<br />11b. Activate the SP add-on 
<br />12. Startup FL 
<br />
<br />Thanks for the response, Nitro. Appreciate the help. 
<br />
<br />Already deleted FL and FLMM, deleted any and all folders relating to FL and mods. Even used reg cleaner to delete one or two entries still there. 
<br />
<br />Forgot to delete save games in My Documents/My Games but checked and there's nothing in there anymore anyway. 
<br />
<br />Will re-install FL and FLMM (1.31 is the correct one yeah?). Quick q though, I should close FLMM before I load Crossfire 1.56 and just double click on the zip.flmm file? That automatically loads it into FLMM doesn't it? 
<br />
<br />And 10b, I thought it was an OpenSP addon, not an SP addon? I would still like to do the SP campaign sometimes so not sure if I'm supposed to load this one as well or not? 
<br />
<br />And one final q....the last time I used FLMM9 (before uninstalling), I had 1.56 and 1.57 showing as separate mods. Is that the way its supposed to be or when you said that 1.57 overwrites 1.56 is it only supposed to show as one mod? 
<br />
<br />Anyways, will have to continue this when I'm back from work tonight. BTW....night shift sucks!  
<br />
<br />Will get back to you and let you know if (hopefully) things are better. Thanks again. 
<br />end post ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />And then one of my last posts where things turned grim...well not really but I can't help being a lil melodramatic. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />copy of post -------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Just had another thought. Is the reason I couldn't get through the custodian gate something to do with NOT having the OpenSP addon? I mean, if I only play the SP storyline missions (which is what I want....I don't want to bypass the story), is there something in there that's not allowing me to access anything outside the NY system? 
<br />
<br />Because the troubles I was having was when I was only lvl 2 or 3 (but I wanted to check out what was on the other side of custodian space) and I don't think you're allowed outside NY until after mish 2 or 3 or whatever yeah? 
<br />
<br />Anyways, just a thought. Going to give it another shot now and see if my clean install has helped matters. 
<br />
<br />Samothraki 
<br />
<br />Edit: Update --&gt; Just activated 1.56 and then 1.57 (got the message about 1.57 probably conflicting with 1.56 and clicked ok) tried to Launch Freelancer and after the Crossfire Splashscreen came up.......crashed to desktop. Again and again and again. 
<br />
<br />Someone....anyone...please help me out here.  I've done a complete new install and followed Nitro's lil guide to the T. With my old install, I never had this prob. Can anyone shed some light on why this might be happening now please? 
<br />
<br />Edit 2: I've just had a lil look in FLMM at the mod folder and saw something strange. I have a folder labeled Crossfire 1.56 that has the readme for 1.57 in it and is only 23.2 MB and a folder labeled Crossfire1 (but no .56 or .57) with the readme for 1.56 in it and is 175MB. Is this normal? It seems like they are switched around to me. Is this normal for other people? 
<br />
<br />Any help appreciated. Don't want to seem impatient but I've had a little taste of CF and I'm starving for more.  
<br />end post ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Anyways, I don't know what to do or try next. I had no probs with the game the first time around with no mods but now everything is going south. Not blaming CF but trying to figure out a way to get this to work on my system. 
<br />
<br />Any help appreciated if you can shed some light on this matter please.
