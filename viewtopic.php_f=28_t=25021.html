			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p17805" class="post-subject">THE TEMP mod - my ideas, and how the were done</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Okay - first, might as well put out my mods ideas that are already up and running and in the mod (fully working).
<br />First the big ones:
<br />
<br />Battleship encounters: - Yep - nephilims encounters script, slightly changed to give me some outcast and corsair action too, also some nomad fighters as capship escorts. These are spawning:
<br />Capital planets - where they fight nomad capships tooo for some action <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />All jumpgates OUT of their space - eg, Liberty capships guard all jumpgates to the IW regions around liberty - likewise with the rest. Corsiars and outcasts patrol thier  own systems, and nomads are nearly everywhre else - but with differing frequency.
<br />
<br />Ships: Some of Caids work, the Astral Prime studios ships, and i am still trying to contact Paul - as some of his stuff is excellent. I have specifically chosen ships that fit in with the FL feeling - NO STAR WARS OR BAB5 OR ANY OTHER SCI FI STUFF. 
<br />Also - ALL ships are flyable in this mod - ie miner, liner, prison, capships, repair, etc etc etc
<br />
<br />Commodities;All commodities require reputations - at differing levels. Cardamine you have to be very friendly ot buy - as with diamonds etc. Water and other such stuff anyone can buy, the rest are at differing levels. this took bloody ages to sort out!
<br />
<br />Prices have changed - some alittle , some alot. Cardamine run to NY from Alpha is about teh most profitable.
<br />New commodities:- Slaves, child slaves, assassins (was terrorists but changed for names sake), Oil, Ice Cream (erm - not my choice, i take orders too you know <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ), passengers (giskard permission), and more than that i cannot remember - will edit it in for you. About 5 of these are illegal contraband (eg - slaves, child slaves etc etc)
<br />
<br />
<br /> Weapons - i have created new weapons for each of the houses, and nearly all pirate factions too. Max fire rate is only 10, min is.........shocking. They are in keeping with FL, and therefore use the same effects - some new sounds have been added for now though......not sure about those yet.
<br />I have also made over 36 new capital ship weapons as well - 3 types for each class of ship from each house. Only mountable on capships.
<br />Trains use the ingame weapons - only mountable on the trains, transports, miners, liners, prison ships etc - all the ingame waepons.
<br />Also - there are a total of about 90-100 new weapons overall - including the bounty hunter sniper gun(very very high damage projectile with a range of about 2.5k - but it drains all the ships energy with 1 shot, and also has a refire rate of about 1 in four seconds. Several types of that, lots of house class 10's etc - also new mines - stationary - they don't come after you - but sit still and blow when within radius of 10m - do vast damage, live for about 45seconds. Also - torp that is like sunslayer - but to stop it ruling in PvP for fighters,it does NO shield damage, it also has worse tracking than the sunslayer. It is intended to only be of use against capships - NOT FIGHTERS!!! no tracking of missiles has been touched - and nothing else has been fiddled with. All original weapons do what they used to do.
<br />
<br />Systems- 3 new systems so far. 1- Comprises of dimensions 60000,70000,50000
<br />Yup - it goes up, has 10 stations, 2 jumpgates, 1 external jumphole, 1 internal jumphole that will take you from the bottom to the top. There are minefields, asteroid fields and all the usual stuff. tradelanes rise up or down at angles to carryyou up and down - like an escalator. 
<br />
<br />2- A very very large system - 3D again. Dimensions are 140000, 50000, 120000
<br />same sort of tradelanes idea. You come  in from one jumpgate, down tradelane to a station. You can then go one of three ways - up one tradelane to the planet that is hovering 20k above the suns (3 suns) or down to the left or right (one shipyard, the other to another base then exit of system).
<br />The planet has four docking rings to it, which docks you with four individual bases. These bases are from Kusari, Rheinland, Liberty and Bretonia, each with their respective house police patroling infront of them. The rings are at the four compass points of the planet - about 2k from each docking ring straight out is another trade lane. Two (either side of planet) of these go down, then turn in either back to the rear of thesystem - or the front - where other bases are. The system has a large pirate base too, as well as jumpholes out. The last tradelane from the far side of the planet goes to a jumpgate to Honshu. 
<br />
<br />the 3rd system is half a minefield (stretches 70000,100000,100000) in size. This minefield has 25 exclusion zones, which are constructed to build a huge maze of tunnels in the mines. Lighting is very bad in here - but there are some nav bouys. inside this minefield maze is one pirate base, 7 hidden wrecks, and one secret unnamed and unpopulated base that might sell a special ship, but certainly sells some special weapons. The tunnels are patrolled by pirates, the secret base by nomads. The secret base is abandoned.
<br />
<br />Okay - now for the novel ideas:
<br />
<br />First - the big ones.
<br />
<br />Ships.
<br />
<br />There are many types of ships being sold in FL, but the prices are more than noraml. Secondly - ships sell all over the place - but the prices vary depending on where you buy them. for example. a Drake brougt in Rheinland costs 20% more than one brought in Kusari, if you buy the eagle in Texas, it is TWICE the cost of getting it in Gamma. Likewise - if you buy the legionarre outside of corsair space, it is more expensive than if you brought it INSIDE corsiar space. Neat huh&gt; Why has no-one else done this?. Also - all ships require a reputation to be brought. Alll capships at house planets (capital planets) all trains, transports, AT, etc etc available at all shipyards (which sell ships)
<br />
<br />Weapons; 
<br />Weapons require a reputation to buy, however, also location of purchase changes price. SOME bases sell more than just their house waepons - but if you buy there, they cost more than the original point - ie, Kusari weapons in Bretonai cost 20% more for low class guns, up to 80% for the highest class gun. Same with anything else - including pirate weapons - these can be brought at other factions bases (selected ones though - not all weapons) and their prices are increased. IE - buy outcast weapons at lib rogues bases, but that is cheaper than at non-aliansied pirte bases - eg, at mollys base it would cost more (bout 50%). Also - Each house system (eg for liberty its detroit munitions) sells ALL weapons mountable - including missiles and mines - at a premiium. To buy a class 10 shield there costs 100% more than in gamma - ie - 2million with my prices. same with guns and missiles. Ammo is more too - its now 20k for a cannonball there.)
<br />
<br />Also - ammo has been shifted - liberty doesn't sell high class ammo anymore, bretonia doesn't sell torps, Kusari sells torps and disruptors but no mines, rheinland sells all miens etc etc. 
<br />Nano bots and bats - cost 200 in house systems, 220 in Independant systems, 240 in border world systems and 280 in the edge world/gamma/alhpha
<br />
<br />*edit* - i put a star next to fully working to highlight - it made it look like a reference to text - ie, parts that are starred are working. They are all fully implemented and working.
<br />

			<h3><a href="#p208505" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Oh - forgot - fourth system - mining system off of frankfurt - belongs to rheinland obviuosly Lots of mining, police and pirates
<br />
<br />
<br />Moving on - equipment - all the norms are here:
<br />
<br />Armor, 
<br />Engines
<br />Power
<br />Tractors
<br />Scanners
<br />etc - each has an upgrade for it as well - however, some might change
<br />They are also only available from certain places - ie, top armor isn't at manhatten - but you have to find it.
<br />
<br />Engines:
<br />New stuff:
<br />
<br />Light fighters - travel at 130
<br />Medium Fighters - travel at 110
<br />Heavy fighters - travel at 90
<br />VHF and freighters travel at 70
<br />Trains/transports = 70
<br />capships = 50 (gunboats are still 119 though)
<br />
<br />More - Light fighters have an energy supply that lets them use thrusters for longer than heavy fighters...........
<br />ie - light fighters (in comparison) have more capacity and recharge rate than heavier ships,, so their thrust can last a little longer - they are lighter afterall! ditto other ships over heavier ones. transports/cpaships have no thrusters or shields
<br />
<br />Light fighters have higher strafe manouverablilty as well - and also can go to cruies in 2 seconds, medium in 5, heavyin 7VHF in 9, trains/transports in 11, capships in 12 battleships in 15
<br />
<br />Second hand ships are available at junkers bases. these ships are cheap versions of their other ones. What they come with - a crapped out power supply that is not very strong - and so cannot support the weapons classes available. Its engine is also banged up - you cannot go over 50m/s, and when you cruise - it takes 12secs to charge up, and will cut out as it uses up your power (so you cannot cruise for more than 1 min at a time) however - you can get nice fighters this way - you just cannot go play with the big boys.
<br />
<br />All ships require a rep as well
<br />
<br />Commodities trade routes have been overhauled so you have to look for new ones, also - there are 3 new commodities that are only minable from asteroids in certain regions. These will be able to be sold locally for a small profit, or at far off distances for a very large profit.
<br />
<br />All engines now require power - more on why later.
<br />
<br />NPC's - apart from extensive encounters - NPC's are able to regen shields and also use nano bots and sheild bateries as well. They all shoot more accurately - but they also use correct power supplies rather than the infinite ones. This means they can run out of shooting power too. Pirates also carry a 'pilot' . these plots are dropped when the pirate is killed (they eject) - and you can either
<br />a) Sell them at planets and bases for small profit
<br />b)Sell them back to pirates for a larger profit or
<br />c)Sell them to bounty hunters (collect bounty) for a large profit. - however, bounty hunters will scan you for them, and atack if you don't hand them over in the field. Sell for high price at bounty hunter stations. 
<br />
<br />NPC guns - for capships and transports/trains all do more damage - as do docking rings/stations (somre fire missiles). Tradelanes also pack a nasty punch to them.
<br />
<br />Some planets have been converted to bases - eg Maine, One in LA (forgot) one in gamma, alpha, planet sprague, and several othres dotted around. travel to the new systems is via jumpgates which have dedicated tradelanes and carefully positioned jumpgates to make it look like they should have been there all along. 
<br />
<br />More ?
<br />
<br />when  you go to the unknowns you will get 'raped' by nomads - its alot tougher now. You actually get pounced by fleets of the things - there is also a nomad base there.
<br />
<br />There is more but i cannot remember
<br />There are four new jumptunnel effects and one jumphole effect, some new lights for things - but see if anyone notices that one <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. Also - new names for NPC's, there is a new uniform for trent on its way hopefully, there is new music for the intro, erm i cannot remember to be honest.
<br />
<br />Oh - ships armor is differnet - capships have 500k for battleships, 300 for destoryers/cruisers and 100k for gunboats. AT and trains / transports have been increased, HOWEVER, ships components for fighters have been decreased, so that it is easier for you to loose a wing, and there for some weapons than it used to be.
<br />
<br />The whole idea of the mod was to create something that increased the freelancer game to what it could have been. AT NO POINT is this supposed to be an extravigance into the modding world. I am not here to make a statement about how much stuff i can put into mods, or to wow you with effects for weapons etc - merely to give that extra little bit that might be missing from the original - hence NO new factions. Mainly as this has GOT to be playable in SP without damaging the game.
<br />
<br />The last one i have tried - but need another player to really see if works is the disableing gun. I made the engines need energy for a simple reason......this:
<br />if you then have a gun that drains the weapons energy - that same energy is the power needed for the engines (tested - and is correct) however, NOT the thrusters - that is another kettle of fish. My reasoning is this: If you could drain the power of the powerplant with a weapon - it would stop the ship moving as the engine has no power left - also, you cannot cruise away........like i said - still not tested in MP yet (ie - on NPC-s this effect is VERY difficult to guage as they use thrusters as well..........)
<br />
<br />Now - anyone is free to any ideas. Ask and i will copy and paste how i did stuff for you as well.........ie - the docking ring planets - i will also paste in the additional tradelanes and positioning for you - so with a quick copy and paste you get your tradelanes to your jumpgate - all correct on orientation etc. 
<br />As with what i have said about anything of mine..............
<br />
<br />*edit*
<br />OH - capships also have no docking problems with tradelanes due to the phantom_physics = true line
<br />
<br />*edit* The docking method used is the one suggested by Wanderer that i have worked on (to be honest i was desperatley trying to get moor working without needing to press escape). I will credit Wanderer here, but if anyone has grumbles as to this - let me know (politely i may add <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).
<br />
<br />Apart from the ships, and the encounters - if anything is here that you feel i should be crediting YOU with - then let me know. Personally - i learnt how to do all this by trial and error - tutorials were NOT used for most of it as they were basically unintelligable.......and i had more fun exploring <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. I learnt stuff from friends IN GAME  but mainly  through my own exploration and trial and error. Sooooo in that light - i learnt how to convert ships all by myself as well as all the other stuff here. Step up to take a bite though if you think you have a valid arguement. Due to me finding it out etc, some of it might not acutaly be the 'correct' way of doing it - so at that point i realy will tell you were to shove it - if you aren't polite!!! <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />Help yourself
<br />
<br />Chips
<br />
<br />OKay - to clear something up - You may use ANY of my ideas here to put into YOUR MOD WITHOUT ASKING FOR PERMISSION, however, there IS a catch.
<br />
<br />You may not take credit for these ideas, and must certainly NEVER make anyone ask to use those ideas - mainly being these.
<br />Second Hand ships
<br />Differing prices per base for ships and weapons/equipment
<br />
<br />If you do include these into your own mod, which as i have said you may freely do, the credits MUST thank <b>Lancers Reactor </b> for them instead! That is it, just stipulate the ideas came from <b>Lancers Reactor </b>, and voila - they are done.

			<div class="content">The reasoning for the TEMP MOD -
<br />
<br />I hate to claim any credit with this thing... I know squat about modding, all I did was provide a few resources for a member of my organization. I &quot;initiated&quot; the project, but I'm sure Chips was already working on something when The Elite's MOD Project came into being.
<br />
<br />There are even MORE features than what he listed here. Anybody who has ever had interaction with The Elite and its members will get a good chuckle out of several things that they will find. I &quot;initiated&quot; this project to make sure that The Elite and its members would be remembered long past the organization's existence. Chips has done an outstanding job, and I can say that througout playtesting his MOD, I've been proud to be affiliated with him.
<br />
<br />Now if I can just finish the music stuff....</div>

This is of course next to FleetWars, anyway FleetWars is more on MP than of SP.  i always loved to destroy a battleship.  it will give a test on my Jagernaut torpedos and Ramrod Missiles.

<br />
<br />   Its just a little disappointing that everyone makes ships from other shows/games, rather than trying to make originals for this - i mean, its ALOT more original to make decent new ship ranges for this game than copy models of ships from somewhere else and plonk them into the game. For one, those won't be yours really due to being owned images already. A bit of originality would be nice, but that takes immagination..............and no-one wants to try that - its too hard.

I am looking for mods that will use their outmost abilities, my ships are all fast and almost uber in design,  they are black in color and stealthy too, just the way i like them to be.   All of them will be used in FleetWars, that's why i cannot realease them and give some pics of them.  Anyway they will carry the insignia of the wanderer except for that agile Ghost X-9.

			<div class="content">Well - i think i have been tinkering and tinkering with the thing long enough - i suddenly thought about it, and in fact, it should be near ready for beta testing. Now - unfort the beta testing is a closed testing for this, so i already have alot of people ready to undertake it, and two servers to test it upon as well.
<br />
<br />However - the purpose of this is to say, it might be coming sooner than i thought - holy sh**! 
<br />
<br />Hopefully there won't be too many bugs to fix, but then again- i found one the other day that has now just disappeared - so i am a little apprehensive about a 'release' date here. I project around 21 days time (gives about 10 testing and four days fixing - followed by approx 5 days testing). 
<br />
<br />Mind you - that is a best projection part there......and knowing the way i just keep tinkering stuff until i think it is just right, it could easily take longer. Hell - if it wasn't for the systems being so modded that i wouldn't be able to seperate stuff - i would have started again yesterday as i found that i didn't like the way i had this organised and layed out in the files. It just wasn't tidy enough for me. 
<br />
<br />At least it gives me more ideas on what to do next time to make it nice and neat!
<br />
<br />Now of course - this is the dangerous bit <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> - if the first testing session goes well - then i might invite some people to download and get a real critical look at it, of course though - i will have to ask permisson for you on servers.
<br />
<br />Leave a note if this has you interested. Like i said - it COULD be some time, but i hope it isn't as i really want to start the next project right now - LOL

			<div class="content">erm - for a little info about things, when on earth did you think that a heavy fighter or very heavy fighter should be able to take a capship out on its own???
<br />
<br />Heck - in normal game format i can take out a fleet of capships with a sabre or eagle as well. Where would be the challenge?? What would be the point in putting in capships if they just rolled over and died easily? Where would the 'capship' part of the name fit in?
<br />But not wishing to make it seem like it is still to easy - i gave them better weapons instead.  Now the capship weapons positively kick some ass, and should wade their way through the slow lumbering VHF's as well. Of course - there may be a slight problem with the mission ships - but i will find out in testing if that is true or not! LOL
<br />
<br />A battleship should be just that - a battleship, where it can obliterate annoying little fighters that come and attack it. The idea is a challenge as well - remember these have no shields though - like they were supposed NOT too in the game as well.
<br />
<br />Now - if you don't like it, either:
<br />
<br />1) Don't play it - lol
<br />2) Erm - learn to be a better pilot! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />oh - ps, there is a new torp as well - but you still need 4 to take out a gunship, and 20 to take out a battleship.</div>
