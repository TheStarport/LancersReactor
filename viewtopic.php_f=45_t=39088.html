			<div class="content">The OKA -Knights 
<br />
<br />I am starting a faction on the upcoming Asgard 3v RPG server. Visit the server forums by clicking <a href='http://www.gamer-forums.com/asgard/' Target=_Blank>HERE</a>
<br />
<br />Quick info:
<br />Faction type: Poilce/Peackeeprs
<br />Will be buying Faction ship and weapons (only this faction will be able to fly/use them)
<br />Goals: Fight crime and act as peace keepers between the houses and other factions. 
<br />Keep an eye on other police factions incase they start to become corupt. 
<br />
<br />Please Read (lots of reading!) on if you even slightly intrested, if not read on anyways its a good story <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> (Story by Titus Black)
<br />
<br />[OKA - Order of the Knights of Asgard 
<br />
<br />History 
<br />The Oka-Knights are an Order of Lawful Knights who fight for the protection of Asgard from the incursions of criminals. The OKA is aiding the four Houses to enforce and protect the Laws.The Okas are divided in several clans who have special customs depending on their history and additions to the general code of honor that all Okas follow. 
<br />An Oka has to respect the Laws of Asgard and the four Houses. First and foremost an Oka has to be loyal to the Law. This loyalty goes before any other as there is the loyalty to the Order, the Clan or any other bonds he may have. 
<br />
<br />The Oka Clans were founded in recognition of the different traditions that the Colonists had brought to the former Sirius sector. The borders between the clans are fluent not adamant. This means that although each Clan follows other customs they all bow to the overall goal of the Order. To enforce the Law and enlighten a better understanding of it. To this end all Oka Clans have found it inevitable to join the OKA at one point of time. 
<br />
<br />The history of the Order of the Knights of Asgard is one of roughly 250 years. In 921AA, 52 years after the Nomad war (A story we know from the memories of a Bretonian named Edison Trent) a group of soldiers from Kusari and Bretonia founded the O.K.A. as an organization to protect citizens where house security did not. These groups where joined by a vigilante guild who was seeking a way to support the whole of the (back then) newly renamed Asgard sector. 
<br />The three groups became the Dragonswords, Flamerager and Wolfseeker Clans. By right of foundation they brought up the first Warmasters (1 of each Clan) and formed the Oka Knights. But their numbers were few and many died in the countless battles against the evergrowing lawless evil. 
<br />In 973AA another Clan was formed to incorporate Liberty Okas into the Order which made the Icebreaker Clan and shortly after in 989AA the Cloudriders Clan from Rheinland completed the Okas even more. After this many Okas died over the years and just a few new Knights came up the replenish the ranks. By the year of 1066AA the number of the Okas had decreased so dramatically that they could barely fill the command structure. 
<br />Following this the OKA sought to broaden the scale of recruitment. Instead of primarily seeking for new warriors other lawful people where also invited. Freelancers, Traders and Miners who were looking for a new path came into the order to form the Gryffonshield Clan. And due to their constant work the Order flourished anew. 
<br />More resources opened new ways and let all of the clans prosper. The idea that there are many good and lawful ways to achieve the goals of the Okas found its supporters even in the founding clans that where traditionally made of pure warrior Knights. 
<br />Today the OKA is short before taking a new step, getting out of its hidden status and taking the fight to the enemy.

			<h3><a href="#p368239" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Short description of the six Clans: (Note: These subdivisions will be on the forums only, that means no Sub tag) 
<br />
<br />The Dragonswords Clan Leader= 
<br />
<br />Kusari warriors in the long tradition of their culture are ready to fight and die every moment. The Dragonswords are sponsored by the Kusari government to assist their forces in defense and safeguarding the planets and systems of the house. 
<br />The element of Earth is the guiding idea behind the Dragonswords. Their honor is exemplary among other Okas and the clan has gained high respect from all Lawful Asgard inhabitants. The clan members thrive in traditional physical combat using melee weapons of all kinds and seeking perfection in wielding them. 
<br />
<br />The Flamerager Clan Leader= 
<br />
<br />Derived from a very old Bretonian knight order, this clan supports the crown of Bretonia in the pursuit of keeping its houseterritory clean and quiet. Bretonian Okas are warrior poets who take life for what it is. Their dry humor is valued beyond the Order. Flameragers are very traditional - some say even more traditional than the Dragonswords. They also are the most militant of Okas. Their specialists have on more than one occasion brought weapons to the Lordmarshal that were rejected for use by the Okas and destroyed to prevent them from falling into lawless hands. The element of Fire makes them excellent fighters and capable pilots of all vehicles. Using their spacecraft to its full ability is the specialty of this Oka Clan. 
<br />
<br />The Icebreaker Clan Leader= 
<br />
<br />These are Liberty's Oka Knights. They protect Liberty and the surrounding systems from its enemies. Weapons and inventions to advance firepower is the field in which the Icebreakers have successfully made great accomplishments. Derived from a Liberty elite force group which joined the OKA in the last century this clan is actually the youngest in the Order. Its members tend to be more easy on serious issues than those of other clans. Nonetheless they are as focussed as everyone else on the fight against evil. 
<br />They also are very good scouts and have added a lot of information to the OKA database. Elementally linked to the Water these Knights are not easily overcome by their foes. 
<br />
<br />The Cloudriders Clan Leader= 
<br />
<br />The doubleheaded Eagle is symbol of this clan who fights with the soldiers of Rheinland. Stealth and massive firepower is the signature of this clan. The gathering of intelligence and its logic analysis is the gift of the Cloudriders. Big capital ships defend Rheinland and add another part in the Okas repertoire. 
<br />Being always more serious and thoughtful, the Cloudriders are seen as humourless from other Okas but in their own way they value a good laugh as much as all Oka. This, additional to the more intense theorethical education, has led to to the upbringing of many philosophers among the Cloudriders. 
<br />Related to the element of Air, the Cloudriders appear to fend off their opponent when they are least expected. 
<br />
<br />The Wolfseeker Clan Leader= 
<br />
<br />The knights of this clan roam the outer rim for lawbreakers to fight. Various outposts have reported these Okas to appear when they're needed and fight until the opponent was destroyed or their own demise came. 
<br />Wherever evil turns to get away from the punishment for its deeds, a Wolfseeker will follow or sometimes already predict it. Going after the unlawful, criminal and treacherous is the goal in the life of every Wolfseeker. This clan has the greatest percentage of simple knights. As they need independence to hunt, not many of the Wolves of Asgard become Lordcaptains. But those who do are held in high respect. The Wolfseeker Okas are multitalents, not as specialized as the more house-related clans. They use whatever means necessary to go after their target. If any element could describe them it's probably Blood. 
<br />
<br />The Gryffonshield Clan Leader= 
<br />
<br />This group is not primarily going after the lawbreakers, but instead defending the Oka bases, supporting their compatriot clans by resupplying and administering the commercial assets of the Order. If any Okas could be called peaceful then its the Gryffonshields. They function as couriers and caretakers. Working on the betterment of Asgard in their own way is what drives these Okas forward. 
<br />The profit is not the goal, but the ability to lend a helping hand where it is needed. Delivering news and working on the public appearance of the OKA is the one thing Gryffonshields enjoy. But do not think of them as pacifists, the Gryffonshields are knights like all other Okas. To defend themselves they fight and use tactics according to their way. 
<br />No special element applies to this clan, it's more like all of them and none at all. Some say that the Gryffonshields are the glue that keeps all the other clans together. Whether this is true or not, without them the OKA would be incomplete.</div>
