			<div class="content">It's kind of long, and a weird post for a first post from a while away, but to those who read it, I guess I'm looking for some kind of solace... Here goes
<br />
<br />It just hurts so incredibly much... 
<br />
<br />I gave her my heart; but last night I got it back... pulverished, crushed, crumpled, maimed, and otherwise broken... 
<br />
<br />She hurt me so much... 
<br />
<br />She seemed so happy; she told me she was happy; she told me she didn't want to lose what we had; it was something special... 
<br />
<br />Now she says (summed up) I'm getting in the way of something more important... (not to sound &quot;religious&quot; to those who aren't 'into' the whole Christianity thing, but) I was getting in the way of her relationship with God. I respect that. She's dealing with eternity right now, not here on earth alone. 
<br />
<br />She might have entered the relationship with me for the wrong reasons. The main reason; I'm convinced, was that she truly wanted to be around me; she liked me... But now, I think there was more to it than that. She said she just wanted to be in a relationship for the sake of having a boyfriend...because some of her friends had them. If that was the case, that was a mistake. Both of us were told that we were too young to be looking for a relationship by pretty much everyone we know. I wasn't looking for anything... I just fell into it. 
<br />
<br />I thought I was ok with it all; I care about her enough to know that she was dealing with reality and eternity. She has an undeniably valid reason. But I really have to wonder how much she thought about it before she decided to ruin my heart... One day; Wednesday... she seemed so glad to be with me... then BAM. &quot;I don't/can't love you anymore. Maybe I never have... I don't want to hurt you more than I already have...&quot; (too late) 
<br />
<br />So much can be read into the equation; Maybe it wasn't real for her like it was for me. Maybe she was &quot;caught up in the moment.&quot; Maybe she was too na&#239;ve. Maybe she said the things she said because she felt obligated. 
<br />
<br />I guess I don't understand how feelings can end in a couple of hours. Unless it wasn't real to begin with. Which really hurts to no end. She told me she wanted to talk to me, hang out, etc... But it's like, she doesn't care if I stay in her life. The phrase &quot;I don't care&quot; says a lot.. She also said it a lot. 
<br />
<br />I would call her. She wouldn't talk. I would ask if she wanted me to go. &quot;I don't care.&quot; I would ask if she wanted to do anything. &quot;Sure.&quot; Give her a couple options. &quot;I don't care.&quot; 
<br />
<br />She told me at the beginning; she had a gut feeling saying it was right. Look where that went. She told me in writing; she didn't want to lose what we had. Then she rejected it in a heartbeat. (now broken heart, but nonetheless...) She told me she wants to be my best friend, to be able to tell me anything. [why couldn't she do that before? She's going to have to work really hard to preserve anything... to make me her confidant... That hurts too; being told that because you loved someone, they couldn't tell you anything of actual importance. 
<br />
<br />In the beginning, she seemed to need me. To want to be around me, to talk to me... I gave her stability while she lived out of a suitcase in 6 different houses... while she lived with a mom who's been divorced twice and is living with her boyfriend, all while neglecting all the motherly duties, smoking cigarettes, pot, drinking... swearing at her 6 year old brother (from a different father) for dressing &quot;gay&quot;... Having a father in Oregon that she sees once in a blue moon. 
<br />
<br />Now it seems like she couldn't care less if I was a part of her life or not. Obviously she doesn't seem to think that her life changed -that- much because of me.. doesn't seem to think that her love counted for anything, if she really loved or not. She says it was real. If it was, how does it end just like that? 
<br />
<br />If it was &quot;going with the flow&quot; that started the relationship in the first place, it seems like it could play a factor in this situation as well. Her best friend decided to break up with her boyfriend today. &quot;Oh, by the way! Happy Valentine's Day! I don't love you anymore! ^_^ I'm not happy in any relationship!&quot; She said it has nothing to do with it. I can't help but have a very strong doubt in my mind that that's not entirely the truth. 
<br />
<br />I gave her my heart... She pretended to give me hers... Then she pulverized mine... 
<br />
<br />I'm not mad at her. I'm just immensely broken. If anything, I should be angry at myself for believing she was old enough and mature enough for her &quot;love&quot; to be real... I guess I was wrong. 
<br />
<br />... I loved her</div>

Stay her friend, be an ear to what ever she has to say. Things could turn around for, maybe. Its like that phraise, Set the bird free, if it returns, it was meant to be, if it does not, then it was meant to be free.. I know all this may not help you right now, but, give it and her time...

			<div class="content">i'm crap at this, but since i seem to be the only one at this at the moment, i have to tell you to stay with us. dont' try anything weird, physically, mentally or emotionally.
<br />
<br />do-not-try to inflict any harm upon yourself.
<br />
<br />if those words were the exact words she used, then i believe she wasn't worth all your attention. then again i have alot to learn in this field. so please don't take into serious account of my opinions as of yet, excluding my advice to not try anything harsh. solace will be upon you soon.

			<div class="content">Don't worry Kimk, I won't...
<br />
<br />It was all just so sudden... No one ever saw it coming;
<br />
<br />I kind of have to wonder how long she thought about it...
<br />
<br />But yes, time will tell, and I've got to work on picking my heart up off the floor and gluing it back together for a while...
<br />
<br />I asked a friend how to mend a broken heart. She told me that it's not easy, and it takes time... (heh, I can believe that) I also asked her if I can give my heart to someone again... That was a yes, because the next person will make me want to give it to her; I'll want to do everything for her... nothing will be quite the same as this one... [edit2: Who knows, it could very well be her again
<br />
<br />I've let her go, but it hurts..
<br />
<br />Thanks for listening and understanding.
<br />
<br />*edit* FF: Well, actually a couple days before, but it's all the same... (to most)

			<div class="content">It's not nice at all, I don't know how old either of you are, how long you'd been together etc. (I would guess a while if she'd lived in 6 different houses) so I would guess it's longer than any of my relationships. I was completely gutted when my last one finished. We'd been together for 6 months. The reason is that we wouldn't have been able to see each other for 9months. It was April last year, I was about to go to Borneo for 4.5 months and about 1 week after I got back, I'd be at southampton Uni. She would already have started at Newcastle uni before i got back. She'd been away for 2 months from Jan to March getting her skiing instructors qualification and decided that 9 months would be too hard for her, I was willing to try. We wanted to meet up in the Christmas holidays but that became impossible for reasons I won't bore you with and we won't be able to meet up until around Sept next year when (and this bit is quite funny) she's organised her 21st birthday bash on sept 5th(so she can have it before starting Uni again). That IS my 21st birthday... ho hum <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />To be honest, I don't think I'll be completely over her until we've met again but life does return and your heart will repair. I'm enjoying my time at Uni and although I sometimes wonder what would be if we'd tried to keep together, you've just got to cope. These things are meant to test us and you'll be a stronger person when you come out of it.
<br />
<br />Good luck and I hope you sort it all out.
<br />
<br />Nick

			<div class="content">I...oh my god! I feel so sorry for you. One of the worst things you can do is break someones heart. If you break up you have to take the decision slowly. Pretending to love someone is something that you shouldn't do because thats just using the person.  I really feel sorry for you. I really do.
<br />
<br />Don't be afraid of your past, unless its something terrible you've done...

<br />Eh... I hear you... I know how you must feel... And I'm sorry you have to go trough all this. Don't blame either one of you... These things do happen for a reason, no matter how small it may seem, or how hard it is to comprehend. I don't think this has much to do with God, it's more of a convinient excuse... I think that she started to like you more than she wanted to, so she got scared... That would explain the repetitive &quot;I don't care&quot;... As if she's trying to convince herself that it is true. I noticed how most people are afraid of deep relationships/true love, because they feel that it will take away their freedom... I know it sounds strange, but people feel that love is an obligation, one that will lock you into a room made of the loved one's needs and feelings... They try to escape it frantically... Like they're claustrophobic... On the other hand, you misjudged your relationship... So you opened up to her when all she wanted was a figurehead, a name to call her boyfriend... Sad but true. I repeat: Noone is to blame. It was but a misunderstanding, a mismatch of motives and wishes... It wasn't meant to be.
<br />It will be hard, make no mistake there... But you will get trough it, and it will make you stronger and wiser. You'll be ok. 
<br />Take care...
<br />

			<div class="content">if i were you i'd take it as an experience to treasure and remember. but thats just me. and you've definitely done the right thing by coming and talking to others. its a good decision you made IMHO.
<br />
<br />as for chetnik's response, thats exactly how i interpreted the situation but didn't trust myself with words while i was nearly dropping off. i only had the sanity to type what i typed.
<br />like he said, she must have been scared to go much further, if you were very deep into the relationship. i hate(i really really do) to be the one to say this, but i think she <i>used </i> you to ease her socialising efforts.
<br />
<br />i am sorry mate. but be happy for the times you've been with her. be happy about the things you did together. for all your hard work, you should get something out of it right? get the happy memories out, treasure them. let it serve as an experience for you to start a new relationship (or a renewed one) when the right time comes.
<br />
<br />good luck. and take care.</div>
