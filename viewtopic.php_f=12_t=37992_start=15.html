			<div class="content">I have a problem with this conversation.  Now I don't know how bad it can get in NI but most of what you describe is history,  I do feel sorry for you if your mother was spat on etc due to your sexual choices.
<br />To be honest, I'm English, and there isn't a big anti-gay sentiment here.  Obviously its not perfect and you do get the occasional 'gay-basher' but then again you do get the occasional racist, facist and terrorist.  Most gays live their life like an other normal person.
<br />Concerning your homosexuality, the one thing that I do know is that the average mid twenties homosexual male is possibly one of the people with the most open mind and are very sensitive to stereotypical prejudices.  Until they make one themselves against somebody who disagrees with their lifestyle choice.  &quot;Religious Fanatics anyone?&quot;
<br />Now, this is interesting as that word and what you mean by that offends me.  I am a very devout Christian and the suggestion that we instantly inform homosexuals that they are evil deviants who are going to hell is just plain wrong.  There is no other word for it, its just wrong.
<br />The one thing about the church that nobody ever mentions is that it does accept anybody from any class, race, gender or sexual viewpoint.  We've moved on a bit since the days of burning people on the stake for their sins (unfortunatley <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) and the quicker the world recognises it, the quicker we can all just......get along</div>

			<div class="content">@devineman - I agree wholeheartedly.  I too am a Christian - does that surprise you?  The last thing on my mind was to slate Christians, in fact you may notice that I avoided it entirely...especially considering that I know this thread will be locked because of &quot;religious discussion&quot;.  I'm sure that you'll agree though, the mind of a true Christian is to love and respect his neighbour - anyone hiding behind the religion to spurt homobophic, racist or sexist drivel is not only belittling the religion but also undoing a lot of good work that people have done to promote the religion.  I am strong in my beliefs....and I don't believe that God would reject me, especially as he made me this way enclined.
<br />
<br />Far too many people hide behind a religious title to take little stabs at minority groups...thats all my point was. At no time was I meaning to offend religious groups....however if you feel that I have done so, then I apologise from the bottom of my heart

			<h3><a href="#p357735" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I would like to take the opportunity to point out the Loc is an openly gay man! He is a moderator, and do you think that if the moderating staff were homophobic, that they would be comfortable, or even get on with him??
<br />
<br />I take insult, because I am being sterocast into what people think we are by virtue of what others say we are.
<br />I live with a gay 24 yr old man - whose bf comes round regularly (who is a top bloke, as is my housemate). However, apparently I am a raging homophobe simply because I am  moderator. 
<br />
<br />Thanks <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Now obviously you cannot generalise everyone like that, and I think its unfair for anyone to even attempt to state that TLR is anti gay at all! Seeing as an openly gay man was made a moderator by two admins should give an indication that, simply by the virtue that they didn't give a monkeys what his sexual persuasion is, that the site cannot promote an anti gay atmosphere. Indeed, Wilde accepts Finaldays judgment (although I have talked to Finalday myself, because I still disagree with it <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), however, everyone else is putting an emphasis upon 'our' homophobia. Indeed, just because the thread mentioned gays, and the fact that FD is openly religious, its being held against him and labelled homophobia instead.
<br />
<br />Once more I see people putting 2 and 2 together to get whatever they <i>want  </i> to see. I know some will not accept this, simply because they disagree (thats fine).
<br />
<br />As to my disagreement with FD locking the thread - I know some will be 'fascinated' by this. There is nothing to be fascinated about at all, I disagree because I am not the same man as FD at all. We all have different thoughts, acts and more. However, FD emailed me to explain why, and I emailed back my disagreement. He is no more wrong than I am right! Its called a difference of judgement or opinion. I know where he is coming from though, and therefore I am satisfied with his call. I know other members are not satisified with his explanation, but that is because they formulated their opinion before hearing his reasoning - and therefore don't believe his reasoning. Does that make them any more right than FD is right? No, its called a difference of judgement and opinion once more.
<br />
<br />The only difference I see is that this has been turned into a mini war against one person, simply because they are not willing to believe his statement or reasoning. Furthermore to not believing it, they have decided to label him as something purely on the basis of that thread and his religion.
<br />
<br />Not particularly fair in my opinion - but then again, everyone wants to be allowed to vent their opinions regardless of anyone elses personal feelings these days. We are also supposed to let anyone post their opinions for as long as they like as well. Guess we will end up seeing how long thats likely to be as well <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />*edit* - just to let you know that I <i>know </i> there are spelling mistakes - I just cannot be bothered to go through them correcting them <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">My point is that the forums just seem way waaay too protected. I mean I know we have to be a &quot;family website&quot; but the youngest I've seen must've been Little Monkey.
<br />
<br />I'm going to go out on a limb here a suggest that pretty much 90% of these users can deal with these issues and don't need to be protected from them.
<br />
<br />Of course we can't let the forums drop into a flaming ninja samurai chaos gorefest but surely some balance can be struck. There are some things that you downrght can't talk about for obvieous reasons, but I dunno, maybe a certain posting area dedicated where people who want to discuss those &quot;heated&quot; topics as such with others. And it can be contained in here.
<br />
<br />I just feel like these days you can't discuss much without it getting some warning. This goes for everything. I know I havn't been here as long as others, but some say it was easier to talk about &quot;hot topics&quot; in the old days. I don't know, I wasn't there and I know that people get in an uproar but like I said before, there could be a place where people can discuss it like reasonable adults.
<br />
<br />Without flame wars being started. If someone wants to be gay, devoutly religious, bi or whatever then that's fine. Far be it from me or anyone else to class them as &quot;inferior&quot; or in-human. We've all got arms, legs and eyes and are all still human regardless of our opinions. And if you guys really are reluctant to make that new forum then could we pull back the forum control police, ease the &quot;clicker&quot; back and de-sanitize slightly to the level of a forum and just see how things turn out. If i'm wrong, tell me so in a couple of months. but until you let things play themselves out, you can only predict what is going to happen. And let me tell you from experience, assumption is the mother of all f****ups
