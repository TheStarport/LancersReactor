			<div class="content">I rarely ask in public forums for advice about personal matters, but I'm in a quandary and could do with any outside input i can get.
<br />
<br />Today I've been offered jobs by two separate companies, both in Manchester(UK) They're both great jobs with excellent companies that have loyal workforces and treat their staff with respect. Prospects and pay for both are very good, both have pension schemes, good holidays, and will pay for professional certficiation and ongoing training. I couldn't ask for more. Thing is, which one do I take? They've both made written offers with rock-solid contracts.
<br />
<br />1. Software house, works in public sector mostly, a little different to what i normally do in that they do secure payment services, and although i'll be service desk and support,  with some installation, it's a step up from what i'm used to. Great firm, very busy, lots of work, very secure, really want me, offered me significantly more than the going rate. Slightly further away, prob about 1.5-2hrs drive in rush hour.
<br />
<br />2. Payment service and billing firm, but here i'll be my usual role of in-house tech support, pretty much exactly what i always do, Server 2003/XP, i get to sort out all the assets and documentation (which i really enjoy doing btw) A little less money than the first one, not hugely but enough to be noticeable, still decent though. Also doing well but not as big a firm, but def very busy and going places. Also a little nearer, about 1-1.5 hrs drive at peak times. 
<br />
<br />All things being equal, I'd take the second. I liked the atmosphere there and it's very much what i normally do, and it's nearer. The first pays a fair bit more and they're prepared to shell out to get me on board, but i wonder if I'm really good enough, esp as it means working outside my comfort zone (although they'll provide all the training I need, they're very supportive) and of the two, the first is prob the better firm in that it's much larger, an IT specialist, with more resources to draw on. 
<br />
<br />I really don't know what to do. Either job is great and the opportunity I've been waiting for years, after a succession of dull tech-support jobs in which i just get abused and paid a pittance. If I was younger I'd def go for the first as a challenge but now I'm getting on it's security I'm after. But does that mean I'm a chicken who likes to play safe? I dunno... any ideas or advice?</div>

			<div class="content">Well, Job A has the benefit of providing you with new skills that may be of assistance later in your career, as well as offering you more legal tender which may come in handy in case there are any complications later on (your house needs repair, there's a medical emergency), etc. 
<br />
<br />Job B on the other hand, is something that you may find more enjoyable in the short-term, but will it be something that you will enjoy in the long term, e.g. would you enjoy the same old tasks five years from now? It is closer than Job A, and you would save 30 minutes of travelling time on average.
<br />
<br />If I were in that position, I would ignore the financial aspects as money is not that important to me, and I would tend to go with a job that I enjoy, and a company that I respect. I would however, consider the potential job prospects offered by the other role. I.e. if I undertook training in the other role and picked up many new skills, would they be valuable in my future endeavours? 
<br />
<br />In essence, it depends upon where you want to go. Stay in Technical Support which you enjoy, or take on additional responsibilties and move into a slightly different area. I would look to the future Taw, and decide where you wish to be.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Now I will wait for Indy to say something profound, which will inspire Taw to accept one choice or another. Indy has that effect on Taw I've noticed. Sometimes <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.

<br />
<br />Edit - Later!!
<br />
<br />Drive is shorter, less stress, fuel, time lost, less wear and tear on the Auto. If you like both, it can be an influence to take.

			<div class="content">The big thing is how you see your future. As mentioned before, the same thing for the next 10 - 15 years. Nothing new learned acquired? What&#8217;s the future like with the ever changing world of software &amp; hardware? Where would you like to see yourself in 10 years? Today it is always good to have a few skills. Company A offers those skills and are also willing to train you to acquire those skills. This may in the long run means much more to you than what company B offers you. 
<br />
<br />Then you also have to look at the future of both companies. Which one will last the longest in this ever changing world of us? Which one do you feel the most comfortable with? What&#8217;s the turnover of staff in these companies?
<br />
<br />Yup, you have some difficult decisions to make. Pray about it. Talk to your government as well and find out how she feels about it. Also remember, the longer on the road, the longer away from the house.</div>

			<div class="content">I would suggest you choose the first option. Why ? From an exaggerated point of view you have to make the choice between &quot;challenge&quot; and &quot;lazyness&quot; (sorry). 
<br />You are not quite sure if you are the right person in company 1 - but the impoprtant is you know you are not the <i>wrong </i> person. So it is challenging - and that's good for you and your personal future. (I am slightly older than you; in our age we tend to saftey and comfort but we need challenge).
<br />
<br />Nothing wrong about option 2, but the way you describe it shows the (psychological) reasons for the possible decision for this company: safety which means in fact: no change, continuity. But on longer terms stagnation means backwards steps. 
<br />
<br />I don't know you personally, but I am pretty sure that you are still willing to accept a new challenge, maybe even eager about it. Just do it ! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />All the best!</div>

			<h3><a href="#p415945" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">After thinking about this all night, I still haven't come to a decision. I discussed the matter with Tawakalnistan's secular authorities and she thinks I should accept the first one. However, I'm still not sure. What it really boils down to is that I know I can do 2 no problem, hit the ground running as they say, but 1 requires me to push into new areas, and I don't think I'm good enough. It isn't really about the money, or the distance. All that matters really to me is job security and I don't want to be in a position where I might f*** up (or if I do, not be able to cover it up like I normally can!) 
<br />
<br />At nearly 43 I'm now at a stage where radical change bothers me, it's not like I don't want to learn new stuff, in IT you have too all the time. But I know what I can do well and what I can't; I know my limitations. I know that sounds a bit pathetic, but all I really want is consistency and security and a peaceful life, pay my mortgage off in a few years and then depart o relocate Tawakalnistan somewhere more civilised, like the <i>Auvergne. </i>
<br />
<br />I've told Company 2 all this and that while they're my preferred choice re: the work itself, I can't afford to ignore the extra money from Company 1. If they can improve their offer, not necesssarily match it but get a bit closer, I'll go with them. 
<br />
<br />I actually feel really bad about doing that, it seems like I'm playing one off again the other, but I'm not. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for all the suggestions and advice, it's helped <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">What you have done is a good move - Hopefully Company 2 will raise the offer a bit. 
<br />
<br />I understand where you are coming from with the stability issues.  I hope that I never need to leave the company I work for currently.  Mostly because I have someone depending on my income to live and the fact that we'll be looking to extend the family in about 2 years.  You having multiple dependants is something serious to consider - the lure of more money and a chance to earn professional certifications would be a big pull for me, but my confidence level in my abilities would push me away from the change.
<br />
<br />I agree with your assessment, I'd do what you are doing.</div>

			<div class="content">Job number 1.  And not because of the challenge although that is an additional benefit.
<br />
<br />From the standpoint of future business stability.  Assuming the Western economies are going to be slowing down ... at least that's what I see here in the US, the need for secure payment processing on the Government side has longer legs.
<br />
<br />The other firm, if they are managing payment services for the private sector only, they may experience an overall downturn in processing volume plus a bad debt factor which may prompt customers to move some of the volume over to a debt collection service, etc.</div>

			<div class="content">all fair points. However, I bit the bullet and went for No 2, as they equalled the offer of No 1 in every way including pay, pension, professional certification, holidays (plus they operate flexitime)
<br />
<br />call me a chicken, but I chose the safer option - safer in respect that the job will be easier and I can go in on Monday and start straight away. I don't feel nervous about it but I felt very nervous about the first one, I really don't think I'm good enough for it. 
<br />
<br />I hear what you say, Edward, and it's a very moot point, but the 2nd firm has solid contracts for utility billing and data processing and I don't think they'll be going awry. It has been a very difficult choice for me as I have to let someone down and they're both quality firms, but in my gut I feel I've made the right decision. I feel very uncomfortable with change.
<br />
<br />Mullahs are instinctively conservative and traditionalist, you know <img src=smilies/icon_smile_blush.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and a steady income stream must be secured for the Tawakalnistan Exchequer so that the Glorious Jihad Against Heathen Rabbitry can be maintained.

<br />
<br />#2 sounds safer now that you have detailed it more.

<br />I myself am prone to seek known comfort zones rather than work myself into a new one so I know very well of what you speak.

<br />I was only looking at future security in so far as you say you need to get one more after your daughter out of the house and self-supporting.
