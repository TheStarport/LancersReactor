			<div class="content">[FYI - I'm NOT making this mod, it's a concept IDEA for mod makers to use
<br />
<br />I've had an idea for a mod called the class mod. It works like this:
<br />
<br />Players start in Liberty (Manhatten) with no ship and $1,000 +/-
<br />
<br />Players have their choise of everything from light fighters to battleships for about $100 per ship (even for BS's and GB's) but here's the catch: Your starting equipment not only sucks royal (It's all lvl 1 in Liberty) you have to upgrade it one level at a time. 
<br />Every single thing that's flyable can support weapons from level one to level ten, so you don't have to worry about trading in that cool fighter for an uglier one.
<br />
<br />Leveling equipment is easy: Once you can afford an upgrade (weapons, shields, engine, whatever) you can only go ONE level higher than what you currently have. I.E. You can't go from a lvl 1 laser to a lvl 3 laser because your powersupply can't handle a lvl 3 laser. So you have to get a lvl 2 powersupply before you can upgrade your weapons / shields from lvl 1 to lvl 2. 
<br />
<br />Also - you have to go around the galaxy to obtain lvl 9 and 10 equipment. Liberty has levels 1 - 3, Bertonia has 4-5, Kusari has 6-7, and Rhinland has 8-9. lvl 10 equipment could be lootable (or something else, ect) So you now have a REASON to go around the galaxy again.
<br />
<br />As for powersupplies, I've thought of a blancing effect for that as well. Some players could abuse the upgrade system by going to Rhinland and buying a lvl 9 powersupply (From a 1 or a 5, ect) so they automaticly can use lvl 1 - 9 weapons. To prevent this from happening, players have to get a power capacitor - they can't be bought. They can only be looted, and you have to fight pirates or military ships to get them. You start with a level 2 capacitor that allows you to buy a lvl 2 powersupply, but you can't go to lvl 3 without a lvl 3 capacitor. Because they can only be looted, this encourages players to test out their new equipment if they want to get higher stats on their gear. The chance for getting a capacitor from a hostile ship is semi-high (20% +/- of your kills will give you one so it won't take forever to obtain a better one than your current capacitor.)
<br />
<br />Certain ships carry certain capacitors - if your in Liberty, all Pirates and Military ships both carry lvl 3 equipment and capacitors on them, and you will only find lvl 3 capacitors in Liberty. In Bertonia, Pirates and Military ships have lvl 5 equipment (maxed out to their system's equipment level, get it?) Ditto for Kusari and Rhinland (and lvl 10 ships)
<br />
<br />This is to prevent players from speeding through the upgrade process and killing their gameplay to about 5 minutes (from thoes nice $500,000 diamond runs) Another good gameplay extender is the capacitor idea.
<br />
<br />Ship stats mimic thoes of TNG 2.0's - every fighter / freighter / GB / BS has the exact stats and prices as the others. The only difference is detail. (Some players like to fly a Bertonia battleship more than a Rhinland, but don't want the Rhinland to have the upper-hand.) Players can purchase other upgrades besides shields, powerplants, and weapons - they can up their armor level at the cost of speed or cargospace, or raise their engines level at the cost of armor, or (providing this is possible) up their cargo hold at the cost of armor and speed, ect. (SUPER custom ships)
<br />
<br />So if you have always wanted to start as a battleship captain (or pizza delivery man) but want a challange with your new ship, you have to EARN higher level equipment.
<br />
<br />Cool idea huh?</div>

			<div class="content">yeah great idea...but...some of that i do not think is possible...like the &quot;increasing cargo space upgrades&quot;...cause cargo space is part of the ships data line in the shiparch.ini....
<br />
<br />the idea has a lot of promise...but i doubt it can be accomplished....but hell don't let it stop the creator...tell em to make it happen...some of that would be great....kinda like buying Full plate armor for a Rouge and losing your stealth abilities and taking a dexterity decrease by -4 <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /> &quot;To live is to die....but living is to die slowly..why waste time on trivial things just play as hard as you can&quot;</div>
