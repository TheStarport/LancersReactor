			<div class="content">California, Liberty Space
<br />
<br />&#8220;3 minutes,&#8221; the pilot called out
<br />&#8220;Check your weapons; we are doing a hot drop! We have fifteen minutes to extract the hostage from the Rogues. We will be storming Alcatraz Depot. Intel puts him to be in the prison chambers which are approximately three levels down from the docking platform. You all know your job now let&#8217;s go and do it!&#8221; Sgt. Mendez yelled over the engines. He didn&#8217;t have to yell, but it was an old school habit he was used to.
<br />The crew of twelve space marines checked their equipment as they prepared to hot drop out of the ship. A hot drop was when a ship would completely slow down as it went by the target, the ship would activate its cruise engines. While the countdown to cruise was commencing the marines would catapult out of the spaceship (in their space capsules) they capsule would then automatically maneuver into position and once the atmospheric density has stabilized the hatch would open and the marines would get to work.
<br />The plan was to quickly go through the Depot, extract the prisoner and get into a ship and takeoff.  Of course they did not have a lot of time; no matter how good you are you can&#8217;t win if you don&#8217;t have enough bullets to shoot. So they had to get in and out as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
<br />&#8220;1 minute&#8221; the pilot beaconed
<br />&#8220;Pressurize suits, get into position, get ready for launch&#8230;&#8221;&#8230;Mendez again, with his loud yelling.
<br />This particular group of marines has been through this before, this was a high profile mission and they were the veterans that were right for the job. What they didn&#8217;t know is that they were being very closely watched by another group of people that knew of a bigger problem and were developing a team of soldiers to solve that problem. 
<br />&#8220;10, 9, 8, 7&#8230;&#8221; the computerized voice counted down in Sgt. Mendez&#8217;s ear piece. 
<br />Seven seconds later they felt a sudden weightless as they were catapulted out of the ship in their portable capsules...

			<div class="content">Sgt. Mendez looked back at their departing ship, a modified rhino freighter. The ship was modified with a new engine that gave it a significant speed boost. It also had a modified cargo hold that held weapons and other equipment that the soldiers needed.  The ship had almost no weapons except for some turrets. It had a very good shield that could withstand 2 torpedo blasts. But nobody wanted to experiment.  
<br />The marines touched down on the wall of the station and made their way forward to the computerized waypoint setting. Once there they cut a small hole in the frame with a portable laser and quietly went in, weapons loaded and ready. 
<br />Sgt. Mendez and Cpl. Dawson were the first through the hole. They had to adjust their bodies as they went through the gravity change. They waited until all the marines were in the station until proceeding into the station. They sealed the hole. It was a temporary fix, an explosive was placed, set to 15 minutes. This would cover their escape.  
<br />&#8220;I got a bogey on my infra red, 20 feet&#8221; one of the marines called out motioning into the direction of the threat.
<br />&#8220;Roger, proceed according to plan&#8221;  
<br />&#8220;I see him&#8230;&#8221; said a marine along with his rifle.
<br />The bullet went supersonic creating a loud bang as it broke the sound barrier and penetrated the pirate&#8217;s body. The bullet instantly slowed down exploding in the body of the pirate causing severe internal bleeding. The marines proceeded down the corridors unopposed. They knew this wouldn&#8217;t last.
