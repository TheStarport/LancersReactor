<br />
<br />Now! now is the time i will free my people killing so many of those murderous dogs. and when its ovr i want the planets to burn. and i will hunt down the surviorers till i die. i WILL kill them all.
<br />
<br />&quot;sir produtions is complete we are ready to luanch the attack.&quot; my second in command informed me
<br />
<br />&quot;good i will be on the bridge of the flagship.&quot; i said
<br />
<br />i walked down the halls. i saw men running to there places the fear in there eyes. but soon no one would fear agian i would restore all. agian the nations will rise and i will see my home rhienland.
<br />
<br />&quot;fleet adimral welcome to the bridge.&quot; the captain said. &quot;i hope this ship suits you&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;its fine&quot; i said &quot;we ready.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;yes sir, the other ships are entering formation.&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />&quot;oh and we are carrying the torpedos.&quot; i said
<br />
<br />&quot;calling them warheads would be more fitting&quot; The captain said &quot;but yes we are carrying 6. we could destroy two suns with that power.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;good and we will launch 6 at one star.&quot; i said 'open the rift.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;yes sir&quot; he said &quot; but you should know we can only open the rift right above there homeworld it will be a big fight. but still when were there it will take on hour for the warheads to be ready.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;right' i said &quot;proceed.&quot;
<br />
<br />Then the rift opened. it was amazing a hole in space. not like a wormhole becuase wormholes are tunnels. this is a hole. a gap. we were the last to go through. 1500 ships went in and i knew the biggest battle ever would begin.
<br />
<br />we came through. there were fighters everywere . ships flying lasers blaring. already one capship was down it was looking good for us.</div>

			<div class="content">Chapter 11
<br />
<br />My ship was rocked with a blast of fire. Crew mebers scrambled to fix the damage. people were scared. i could see the fear in there eyes. i watched on the screen as shiped fought each other. 
<br />it was so odd it was like they were dancing and one who could not dance would die. one great reading tuaght me something very valuble. the reading said &quot;here are three types of strength. one big strong and nasty. 
<br />two smart and tactil. three strenth in numbers. early one humans fought things much stronger then them. great tigers and such. at first they would die easly. but then people discovered ways to kill the tiger with bows and arrows. 
<br />so number one was not nessacarly the best path but number two could never know out number three. and number three killed in the thousands to millons. bugs! alone they were harmless but they could spread plauge and kill many together. so the wise man would say take all three paths.&quot;
<br />
<br />i when i first commanded others i thought this teaching to be foolish but now i realized its value. kind of sad the day thousands were to die is the die i learned truly how to fight. it was not long ago i was refusing to leave a small patrol. now i commanded a armanda.
<br />
<br />ships fored upon eachother. volley after volley was fired. ships popped in and out. fighters tlied each other. each time one fell two more popped up. it would never end. for the pilots it was if time had folded on itself.
<br />
<br />&quot;admiral the warheads are ready.&quot;  said the captain.
<br />
<br />&quot;set a course for the sun&quot; i said &quot;get a escort.
<br />
<br />&quot;yes sir&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />We aproached then sun and were about to fire. but something stopped us the very dead stopped us.
<br />
<br />&quot;admiral&quot; the captain said &quot;there is a ship not a enemy ship sir. but not one of our ships sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;can it be indenified&quot; i asked
<br />'
<br />&quot;yes&quot; he said &quot;its the fighter from the starfinder. one life aboard. wait ! its hailing us!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;put it up. now!&quot; i said but then as i saw who it was my world changed.
<br />
<br />&quot;what your doing is not right Arion yo can't kill millons of people. people who are peacful.&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />&quot;who are you!&quot; i demanded.
<br />
<br />the man sighed. &quot;i am Lixin&quot; he said
<br />
<br />&quot;no.. no... he died.&quot; i said
<br />
<br />&quot;wrong we all realzied at the last moment that we could use the fighter we all made it.. but the other... thats not importent what is is that you dont fire those torpedos&quot; Lixin said &quot;its wrong  and if you try i can and will stop you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;there is no other way!&quot; i said.
<br />
<br />&quot;yes there is&quot; Lixin said &quot;thses aliens have all there computers to one planet. we destroy that plannet. it maybe a massacre but its better then destroying every planet. the wont be able to build ships it ill take them thousands of years to recover.order you captail ships to begin a bombardment i will go to them.&quot; 
<br />
<br />'alright we will remain here i case&quot; i said
<br />
<br />&quot;alright im going&quot; he said
<br />
<br />five minutes later i turned to the captain. &quot;is he out of range.&quot; i asked
<br />
<br />'yes sir!&quot; he said
<br />
<br />&quot;fire the warheads!&quot;
<br />
<br />END
<br />
<br />Epiloge:
<br />
<br />i had landed on New Berlin. it started to rain. i felt it on my hands. it felt wonderful. funny, i had never felt rain before.</div>
