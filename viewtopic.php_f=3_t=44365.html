			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p33862" class="post-subject">Favorite Weapons, Equipment, And Ships!</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Welcome ladies and Gentlemen, and nomads, and order, and Corsairs, and LPI, and GC, and Blood Dragons, and... *cane pulls man off stage, loud screaming heard, then man comes out again on stage with two black eyes and a bloody nose, barely able to stand.*  This is a thread were u can discuss and debate your favorite weapons, equipment, and ships! So just jump right in, say your favorites and your reasons, debate why there better than others, and so on. Here we go!
<br />
<br />Id have to say that GMG turrets are cool with the refire rate, but not as good damage as the Firekiss turret, who agrees?
<br />
<br />Is it just me, or does the Barrager turret and guns  might not have best damage, but it makes a cool sound, has awesome refire rate, and looks really cool? same with the Golden Chyrsthmeusem's [however you spell it. Suncannons. Like I said earlier, i have two on my Drom.
<br />
<br />I just wish they would sell pyroses at places other than edge worlds. If you took the time to go to Ruiz or Malta, you definetly not going to get a Pyrose instead of Wyrm or Kraken. But its good newbie [im not calling anyone neewbie, we were all Newbiees once, so im not being disrepectful. weapon for ships like Dagger, Bloodhound, Patriot, and Rhino if the thing can fit class four weapons, tho i dont think it can. So maybe in some improvement mod they could sell em at Buffalo, Montezuma, Rotchester, and such instead of having to kill 70 outcast daggers.
<br />
<br />Has anyone ever piloted a Stiletto, if so, how to they handle like? Im always a fan of Borderworld ships, Dromedary and Dagger being some of my favorite ships.
<br />
<br />Do you guys think that the Barracud doesnt have enough energy capacity? i fit like 6 warriors on the thing for my friend when he comes over, and in 10 shots its down to zero energy.
<br />
<br />Is it just me, or does the ship infocard tags are far two much braggy. Take these for example.
<br />
<br />With its increased power capacity, &quot;The Bloodhound&quot; represents a significant threat to police forces and shipping targets in Sirius. Heavily modified from its original chassis design, this fighter is fast and can deliver a lethal payload and array of offensive weaponry. These factors make this ship of great value to alternative fighting forces everywhere.
<br />Thats for the Bloodhound light fighter. But &quot;A lethal payload and array of offensive weaponary?&quot; with max of level four weaponary. 
<br />
<br />With the economic foundation of Sirius firmly built on Liberty's commercial interests, &quot;The Rhino&quot; certainly lives up to its name. The vast cargo hold is the hallmark of this impressive beast, surrounded by doubly reinforced structure and protective armor hull. This and the advanced weapon system make &quot;The Rhino&quot; a force to be reckoned with.
<br />
<br />Thats for the Rhino, and ill give, the thing is handy for single house and some borderworld trading. I know, ive been spoiled by the dromedary, but &quot;A force to be reconed with? Advanced weapons system?&quot; when was level three weapons considered a force to be reckoned with. overall, good starter ship, but oy veh, the Dromedary is much better.
<br />
<br />One of the ships i like, is the Wolfhound. good weapons for being real close to Manhatten, but i know grandma's that turn quicker than the thing. For trade lane disrupting, the things alright, but i'd prefer my good ole Dagger. Well, i dont like her that much when i go against Eagle or titan, but shes a good ship.
<br />
<br />Okay, before i set the record for longest post, i think all stop here. Tell me what you think of these and your own opinions! Debate them with me too! Dont be afraid to write long posts!
<br />
<br /> When all else fails, tell them you want world peace.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p410158" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">The first time I played Freelancer I fell in love with my Anubis, mainly because I had been piloting the Crusader (the Bretonia VHF) up to that point in the game. 
<br />
<br />I felt really strange selling my Anubis for a Titan, even though I knew the Titan was a superior ship... but that's as far as I played that savegame (didn't really like the titan either)
<br />
<br />
<br />My newer games that I've played I've kinda fallen in love with the light and medium fighters. I nabbed a Dagger after going to Bretonia and kicked out of Liberty in the storyline... fell in love with it's maneuverability and the amount of punch it could pack.
<br />
<br />
<br />I still like the VHF/HF class though... and if we're allowed to bring modded games into this.. in my newer Evolutions 1.30 savegames I'm using primarily light and medium fighers, but I did briefly switch to a civilian HF (can't remember which)... thing turned like crap, but it packed a huge punch, and was fun for a little bit.
<br />
<br />Right now in my Evolutiosn 1.30 savegame I'm flying a Couger... which is a civilian Medium Fighter - mounts up to lv7 guns, has 5 gun hardpoints and 1 turret (I think... it might be 4/1), and is fairly manueverable (not as much as a Dagger though).
<br />
<br />I'm saving up for an Edge world fighter... The Basilisk or something like that... but these are both modded ships. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />Favorite equipment - I dont' really have any. My loadout constantly changes. In one game I might use only 1 or 2 lasers to take down shields and then hit them with missiles to kill em, another game I might use ALL lasers (my Couger currently has no missiles)
<br />
<br />Never did learn to use mines properly. Though I love torpedoes. I know a lot of people dislike them for their high cost, but what's better than firing a big, slow-moving blob and watching it utterly destroy the Titan you shot it at? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I also vary in my favorite guns... every now and then I like to dogfight and wear my opponents down with high refire rate laser weapons, other times I like to load my entire ship out with energy-sucking plasma/tachyon weapons to do TONS of damage but with little refire rate. Just depends on my mood, and the ship I'm flying. If I'm flying a LF I'll stick to the higher refire rate weapons with less damage as I can literally fly circles around HF and VHF usually. If I'm in the latter, a HF or VHF I tend to like the &quot;heavy hitting&quot; guns more, one or two good shots will take out most foes with those weapons.
<br />
<br />I've never seriously flown a freighter before... guess it would be possible with Evolutions 1.30 - though I would probably rather save up for a Transport or train if I'm going to do trading routes.</div>

			<div class="content">Note: This replay have spoilers, so I don't know if it's OK to be here. I think all this topic should be on the Spoilers Forum ?!!!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />First of all I will write only about ship in the org. game and SP, because if I debate the ship from the Mods I probably end this year captured in here! (tanx to all that great people wich made thoes amazing ship for as)
<br />
<br />Here I come.
<br />
<br />Starflier. Few people talk about this ship, but I prefer to keeped until almost I leave New York. It is the most manuvrable ship in the Sirius and for a novice it is great, especially when it's armed with Xeno weapons. I know she don't have the energy to power those weapon, but if I am a little carefull with the aiming she's doing gest fine.
<br />
<br />Defender. This is the best ship to have in Liberty. Armed with Scorpion and Justice + Stunpluse turret it's more then enough to bet the New York ship!
<br />
<br />Dagger. It's a very fast ship, good armour (Hovis have this ship, because is very manuvrable). I usualy have on my Dagger the dragon tachyon cannon (class 4) and the Stunpluse turret.
<br />
<br />Drake from Kusari. Armed with those tachyon cannon and a good shield it is a formidable ship. I remember once I keeped until I changed with the Anubis!
<br />
<br />Dragon. It's very triky to take this one, in SP! But, I will not spoiling  how to take it.
<br />
<br />Anubis. Well this ship is a little to big, a little to slow especially after you have the fast manuvrable Drake or Dragon. But, you don't have any other options in the SP game!
<br />
<br />After the SP ends, it's not very important what ship I take. Usual I take Dromadery to reach the max level, and after that I changed into Sabre or Titan.
<br />
<br />The last one it'a again Starflier! Because I allways restart the game...
<br />
<br />Freighters. 
<br />I allways take some freighters when I need money. Depends on my characters Lv. But, I prefer the Mule or Drom. 
<br />That's about all, for the ship.
<br />
<br />Weapons.
<br />i don't know why but I prefer tachyon cannon. It's look great on the Dragon ship with the Dragon cannon in the HUD! But, this weapon will drain energy very fast, so it's imperatives to aim very good.
<br />(I remember once I have on my Sabre 4X Nomad Energy Cannon + 2X Sunblast GMG photon cannon and a Luger turret. The Nomads don't have any chances.)
<br />
<br />Missile.
<br />Usualy I don't take them. They are expensive (ammo) and in SP I always run out of ammo for them. So, I will stick with the cannon.
<br />
<br />BTW. In this game are 5 ship with the name started with &quot;D&quot; all of them are very good ???</div>

			<div class="content">Starfliers do kick Liberty rear when  u have Xeno weapons and that awesome manueuverablity.  Ill have to try out that defender idea u had. BTW, u like GMG weapons, i do of sorts but dont really use em. Only on Gastropedia server where u start with em.   But my deal is i love thrusters. I always use them in combat, in between trade lanes, and the like. But i hate it when a formation leader uses the suddenly. throws u off track. But anyway do u guys use thrusters alot 2?
<br />
<br />Heres another exapmle of what seems over selling a ship.
<br />&quot;With comparable models in active government and military service, the &quot;Patriot&quot; delivers state of the art maneuverability and punishing firepower in one unbeatable package. Impressive extensibility and a generous cargo hold round out the top notch appointments.&quot; I might have been spoiled by dromedaarys but the generous cargo hold part is a wee bit off. state of the art manueverabilty? Yes. Punishing firepower? No. Max of level three guns. But like i said. We have all been spoiled so much by Eagles, titans, and the such, that we all forget the joy of piloting one of these fine, but sold as over fine ships. Personnaly, i like the patriot, not as much as the dagger, but i dont like it when it gets blasted to peices anywhere outside Liberty. What do u think on this? and what is ur favorite ship. Mine is Dagger or Dromedary. Post yours and say what you like and why u think there better. Well save the endless Sunslayer torpedo launcher for another day. Lol.</div>

			<div class="content">Well, looks like I'm going to clone my answer just like in Zeta's another thread about favorite Freighter, lolz.
<br />
<br />My favorite Ship? Of course the Drome! She has the biggest cargo bay. I mean... THE BIGGEST! That would be for vanilla Freelancer... I don't know about the other mods that have larger cargo capacity than that...
<br />
<br />Anyway, why did I fall in love with Drome? 'coz I like its shape. Edgy all over her body ^^
<br />
<br />Favorite Equipments? Well... basically I have no fancy with &quot;those Kusarians' are the best&quot; or &quot;Outcast's has better firepower!&quot; and even &quot;I like laser weapons because they sound cool.&quot; :p
<br />
<br />My equipments consist of... well balanced weapons. Flashpoint and Sunfury-1 are my Laser-Photon based guns, who knows I'm gonna deal with my opposing clan which uses Positron...
<br />Anti Molecular shield: Scrambler Turret-1 (Neutron) and Stealthblade Mk-1 (Tachyon).
<br />last, Anti Graviton: Flamecurse Mk-1 (Plasma)
<br />
<br />&quot;What about the particle?&quot; you might wonder. Well... got lost in a battle... my friend shot it with extreme accuracy....<img src=smilies/icon_smile_dead.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Missiles? They're useful. It's like... using the right shoes for dancing... if you know what I mean...
<br />
<br />That's for freighter. My second favorite ships would be Stilleto and Drake. They are the best &quot;dancers&quot; in Freelancer... imho <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />_____________________________
<br />
<br />Being a Smuggler is a great option! Economically calculated, U get commodities for free and sell them for thousands... remember not to pilot after taking some Cardamine....</div>

			<div class="content">You all know what's coming so I think I'll skip fav Freighter, but I do like the Bertonian freighter as well, good alternative to heavy fighter if you'er a good pilot looking for a challenge.  Fav light fighter? Legionaire, best in terms of firepower, balance, etc at that point in game, and looks cooler than Drake.  Fav Heavy Fighter? Hmm I don't know, defender maybe, don't use them much, generally don't like them.  Fav VH fighter?  Either Eagle or Hammerhead, sure the HH can't equip c10 weapons but the titan handles like crap, and I just don't like the stilleto or whichever one it is.  Fav weapons? generally anything with a refire rate of either 4 or 5.88 is good, don't like laser or high refire weapons, they're annoying, and 3 or 2 refire is just too slow for my taste.  Unless you're using Lavablades early, then they're good, and 3 refire weapons are rather rare therefore I don't use them.  I have developed a liking for missles, but only with mods that raise ammo limit to 100+, but cheaper ammo would be nice.  With missles I prefer Firepower to accuracy, and torps are near useless.  And am I the only one who thinks that missles should just go FASTER? I mean really, you can outrun missles, in any other decent Space combat Sim that would be unthinkable, and rightly so (lock-on and better homing would be nice too).  Never used mines or cruise disruptors, though the Disruptors would probably have been useful sometimes, the mines are useless.  And if modders are reading this ships from Freespace series would be great, I find it sad that the greatest space combat sim ever has been so completely ignored (well it and I-War 2).</div>

<br />
<br />Well... no! I think the same way too! Missiles should be made faster... let's say, 110? Plus your accelerated ship (199 or 200), that would be 310! Now, that's a missile... Of course, missiles can be avoided only if you're an ace or using lots of CMs...
<br />
<br />I have to reconsider about that Bretonian little fish ship.. what was that again?  Cavalier!
<br />
<br />Now I remember that name. That little fish looks cute from a far.. and I lost my weapon again (again!) while foolishly cruise right to him... an opposing force's spy!
<br />
<br />Nice agility and speed. I think that's Bretonian answer for Kusarian Drake, eh?

<br />Yes, the power drained fast but the damage you could hand out in a short burst was amazing. You just fly around do a few barrel rolls waiting for a recharge and go in for the kill. If You are fighting a Saber, Titan, or two or three it gets a little hairy, and it may take a few more recharges but you can take a Titan or three, and or a Saber or three with that setup. 
<br />
<br />Now I&#8217;m talking about Vanilla Freelancer. You don't want to try this in my New Storyline mod or you will be dead. The NPC's don't mess around and there AI is very aggressive.
