			<div class="content">no I wasn't referring to her &quot;twist&quot; and &quot;twirl&quot; but indeed to her betrayal of the Resistance, albeit well-motivated in her efforts to protect Col Tigh. I'd like to know what's been happening to make her so protective of him, seeing as she didn't used to give a damn about him? 
<br />
<br />well, Galactica-Sharon (Helo's Sharon) is def going to be alive mid-season, as is Anders, the Chief, Cally, Col Tigh, former Pres. Roslin, and Tom Zarek. According to the polt synopses, they'll all be off New Caprica in the next two epiosdes (Exodus 1 &amp; 2) and back on Galactica. Big bust up between the Adamas though. Baltar doesn't go back with the Colonials, but he's still going to be a main character and rejoins the fleet mid-season (with Caprica 6 or not, I dunno)
<br />
<br />Gaeta is going to be interrogated for being a collaborator, no-one yet knows he's the Chief's secret source within the puppet govt. Dunno what's going to happen to Jammer, the dorty traitor. I want to see what's going to happen re: the executions! do the NCP turn on the Centurions? was the gunfire from the execution site or from the ambush? why did the Centurions fire on Galactica-Sharon when we were told explicitly that they can't shoot any humanoid Cylon models? aaaaaaaaaaargh I can't wait till the weekend! And I wanna see what Adm. Adama's plan is that Lee got so worked up about. 
<br />
<br />I find the clear parallels with regard to our own current circumstances and world affairs rather compelling and most interesting, don't you?</div>

			<div class="content">Wow, Taw. You seem to know quite a bit about what is to happen. A big 'break up' between the Adamas has already happened (seems like that goes on every other episode). Its not really over moral issues, its the father getting upset about the son being overweight. Which, he is. 
<br />
<br />Interesting thoughts about Roslyn and Zarek... it was interesting to see the rivalry disappear between the archenemies at the end of the premier. Who knows if the friendship will hold?
<br />
<br />What I don't get, is how Baltar has an 'inner 6' and how 6 has an 'inner Baltar.' Does this foreshadow that Baltar is a Cylon, or is perhaps their inventor, or their controller subconsciously? So much potential.
<br />
<br />I hope nothing happens to Gaeda... he's one of my favorite minor characters.</div>

			<div class="content">the rift between the Adama's gets even wider when Apollo refuses a direct order from his dad re: the rescue mission to New Caprica. however don't misjudge Apollo on this - you'll see that even though his dad is right over the rescue mission, more is revealed that shows Adm Adama to not be the rock we believe him to be. 
<br />
<br />As regards Roslyn and Zarek, word has it that Balthar did indeed reward Zarek for his help in the election campaign by making him VP when  they went down to New Caprica, but didn't deliver on his other promises; we've yet to find out if Zarek split with him, or if Balthar dumped him. Whatever, Z was effectively out of a position of influence when the Cylons turned up, and as we know from last week, was arrested almost straight away. 
<br />
<br />The whole &quot;inner 6&quot; and &quot;inner Balthar&quot; thing is very mysterious isn't it? Rumour has it that this will never be fully explained, it's just meant to be very bizarre and act as a handy plot device. Still, you don't want everything to be explained away do you? <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I like it as it is, the internal Balthar was a stroke of genius imo, gave a whole new dimension to the Cylon psyche, and showed Balthar as stronger and more human than he ever is is &quot;real&quot; life if you get my drift (and giving James Callis more opportunities as an actor too)
<br />
<br />The Starbuck's cylon kid story is designed to lift the Starbuck character out of being a hotshot bigmouthed pilot and lift her into a different realm - you'll be getting a lot more mysticism this season and more blurring of the lines between human and cylon. And the Cylon's are looking for Earth too! (but according to RDM, the fleet will *never* actually reach Earth) 
<br />
<br />I'm not <i>that </i> well-informed, I just like to find stuff out, but it's all available. Have you tried the Battlestar Galactica Wiki at all?</div>

			<h3><a href="#p414007" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">just saw it myself, wow, I was really excited! really pleased that Ellen Tigh got caught and wasn't able to do a number on Col. Tigh, although to be fair, she was doing it cos she loves him and didn't want him harmed - treason is treason though. I really do want to know what's brought on this change in her character to dedicated wife from the conniving hussy she used to be. 
<br />
<br />Nice to see Sgt Hadrian back in action (last time I saw her she was in the brig after the tribunals in Season 1, although i remember she was mentioned in the episode where the Cylons boarded Galactica in Season 2.) Wasn't expecting any of that, really thought the Cylon ambush would work. What about shtoopid Cally, running right into the line of fire? (ok she didn't know, and it was for dramatic effect on the part of the writers of course, but of all of the directions to run? I'm sure she was running downhill at first as well, and on the other side of the trucks?)
<br />
<br />So the reincarnation process takes it toll on Cylons for sure, but we'd already had an intimation of this in &quot;Skar&quot; when Sharon told Starbuck that Skar was full of hate and that the download process was painful and terrifying. Interestingly, when Adm. Adama was giving his pre-battle speech to the Galactica crew, he said that they would become immortal (in memory and legend) and maybe this will ultimately be the lesson the Cylons learn from humans, that despite their technological life eternal, the only immortality worth having is in the hearts and minds of your people? Or in the love of an individual? That's why the Cylon's want to reproduce sexuallythough, not for procreation itself, they can manage that fine in their cloning vats, but to create something new from an act of love, which only humans can do.
<br />
<br />Cylons dream and have visions too, and doubts! although one wouldn't have expected it from a 3. Caprica 6 said she'd change her opinions if she ever knew true love, and the Oracle said she'd find it when she held Hera in her arms. Very intriguing side plot - afaik 3's are amongst the most dedicated and single-minded of the Cylon models. I'm pleased she didn't &quot;turn&quot; Sharon, but what she said was trye, Adama did indeed lie to her. These moral paradoxes are fascinating stuff. I wonder what will happen to the other Sharon (the Chief's Sharon) on New Caprica? For that matter, what will happen to Balthar and Caprica-6 once the Galactica rescues the people? And Doc Cottle is such a rotten liar, isn't he? He's one of my fav sub-characters, btw, miserable and cantankerous but with a heart of gold. 
<br />
<br />(btw there being 3's on New Caprica presumably means that the Colonials know full well that Deanna Biers is a Cylon, although Anders' resistance fighters would have known that from Caprica. Was she arrested while the Fleet were still in space, is she dead, or is she down on New Caprica? the 3 in the episode was the 3 from Caprica who Caprica 6 killed with a piece of rubble. 
<br />
<br />I'm really getting annoyed with Starbuck, she's weakening. Mind you she has been locked up for 4 months, but even so, the kid is a Cylon plant - I'd have let it die. I knew she was vulnerable to Conroy from the time she was interrogating him on Galactica, he tied her up in philosophical and emotional knots like Cmdr Adama warned he would. But then, the writers are developing her charcter away from the one-dimensional hotshot pilot by exploring her vulnerabilities, we already know she was physically abused as a child and that she had a very difficult relationship with her father. We also know that she can be weak when it comes to men in her life, Zak Adama for one, who's death she was  directly responsible for (although Cmdr Adama was also to blame)
<br />
<br />Will Tom Zarek become Roslin's VP now they're buddies at last, having faced death together (again?) And I've seen a screenie of Gaeta being interrogated back on Galactica by a tribunal - he'll have to find a way to convince them that he was the mole in Balthar's &quot;govt.&quot; Quite how Jammer's going to get out of his &quot;jam&quot; I dunno; if you look back at his history, he's been negative and morale-sapping since the beginning. And just how did he manage to survive in a storage locker when the Cylon Centurions killed everyone else in the compartment when they boarded? but his interrogation by a 5 would pretty much indicate that he's not a Cylon himself, unless he's another sleeper?
<br />
<br />And, since Sharon is now a Colonial Warrior again, and Adama trusts her, and she trusts him, has she told him who the other Cylons in the Fleet are? 
<br />
<br />Man, i didn't want that episode to end - I howled &quot;Nooooooooo!&quot; when it went off! Can't wait for next week! it's going to be such a good battle...

			<div class="content">I agree with you on that scene, Taw. The scary part is, while that has enabled the rescue mission to go through, it'll only make it harder when Adama is forced to reveal the truth, which I'm guessing is going to be pretty soon. Nice to know also that the download process is very painful... enough that it is making at least one of them want to leave.
<br />
<br />And you're right about Doc Cottle. He's about the only one that really looks like he came from the original series.</div>

			<div class="content">just watched it. I'm all a-quiver! def &quot;best episode ever&quot; !
<br />
<br />points to consider:- (don't read if you don't want it ruined if you haven't seen it yet)
<br />
<br />1. will Zarek now be Roslin's VP, and how can this constitutionally work? She was democratically voted out, she ahs no legal madate, and he was the VP of a now-disgraced but legitimately elected President. Legally unless new elections are held, Zarek should be President!
<br />
<br />2. So Starbuck's kid was human all along? I'd figured that Conroy was frakking her over on this - it's what he does. Everything he says is a lie, especially where Starbuck is concerned, but she weakens to him more very time. Still, excellent acting by Katie Sackhoff there, I really felt her pain and loss when she realised Kasey wasn't her kid.
<br />
<br />3. Jammer - what a wesel. he's now a hero of the resistance even though he was paid up member of the NCP! how lucky just to be in the right place at the right time to become part of the group that retook Colonial One.
<br />
<br />4. Col Tigh - will Ellen's loss mean that he finally becomes a decent guy? or will he become even more of a mean s.o.b. than he was before? Very touching scene that was between the two of them, btw, deftly handled by the director.   
<br />
<br />5. Galactica's appearance above New Caprica City and the fiery descent - well, I've never seen anything like that in sci-fi before, my jaw was on the floor. Truly magnificent. One of the most heart-stopping sfx I've ever witnessed. The to add a Viper launch through the flames, then to jump out straight away? Awesome, in the full meaning of the word. then...
<br />
<br />6. Pegasus! I guessed that Lee would disobey orders and return, and I kinda guessed that they'd lose the Big P, but hoped they wouldn't. Hopefully they won't face anymore huge Cylon fleets though, and besides, the Chief has something to do again with no more construction and repair facilites. 
<br />
<br />7. Kat did very well indeed for a stim-junkie - but will she lose her position as CAG now that Apollo hasn't got a command and Starbuck is back? 
<br />
<br />8. Are we to presume that none of the folks from New Caprica will have a pop at Sharon, seeing as she's now a Colonial officer (and a hero) again?
<br />
<br />9. So the Cylons have Hera, which is ultimately what they really wanted all along. But will this be a good thing for them or their undoing? After all, No 3 now knows that the Oracle was right, that she now knows true love, and Caprica-6 told her that she would change her view of everything once she did. Will Hera be the catalyst that changes the Cylons forever? 
<br />
<br />ah, it was frakkin' superb. I was squeaking all the way through it. Best show on telly bar none.</div>
