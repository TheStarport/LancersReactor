<br />
<br />enrich Bundaberg is more accurate. don't think your hidden agenda hasn't been found out, Flopsy. there's many a poor child who's pestered his parents to let him partake of your foul pseudo-alcoholic beverage that's ended up in hospital because of the rapid acidic corroding of his taste buds. Just bcause you bathe in it doesn't mean you have to inflict it on the rest of us.

			<div class="content">Indy - It is a common misconception that Esquilaxitavian beliefs are based upon religion. In fact, the beliefs of the Esquilaxitavians are the opposite as they are secular, and are even seen by some to be semi-Agnostic. The religious order itself is simply a means to an end; ie. organising Esquilaxitavia into a hierarchy and fostering peace and understanding. The Rabbit-God does not care if people follow his teachings; that's up to the individual. The Rabbit-God also does not believe in forcing his views upon others, he simply offers an alternative. I reckon you've bin listen' to that Taw-fella's propaganda again. He's just jealous of my wide-reaching influence.

			<div class="content">On the contratry famed early Irish manuscripts many of which are translations of the bible by the first Christian Monks are adorned with the most spectacular iconoclastic imagery some of which are even embossed in gold have lasted over 1,000 years. One such manuscript <i>The Book of Tic Kells </i> holds an image which ties Exquilax directly into Christian scripture and also goes some way to explain the origins of the cross bred &quot;horse-hare&quot; form.

			<div class="content">There was a story of why Esq and Taw seem at odds, it is from thier past lives, an over view, if ou will. <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>The Emperor, Tawakalna the first was just leaving the Senate forum. His praetorian guard fell into place, two fore and two behind as he set off for his chambers. 
<br />
<br />The senate was a buzz with conversation. One senator arguing with another. &#8220;My fellow senators, please&#8221; Senator Esquilax began &#8220;Let us resume our business&#8221;. A calm began to move over the forum. Caesar had caused quite an uproar and disrupted the business at hand. But gradually, Esquilax was able to get order restored. He had a way with people, perhaps that was why he held such influence in Rome. He and Caesar had many &#8220;discussions&#8221; about the military. But the Senator would never give in to allow the army in side of the city walls. He believed that was what the praetorian were for. 
<br />
<br />An senatorial aide approached Esquilax, &#8220;I beg your pardon Senator&#8221;. &#8220;What is it Jagged&#8221; Esquilax replied, turning his attention to the young man. He was an able aide that served the senator well. &#8220;I was wondering it you wished to have a meeting with some of the other senators this evening, to discuss the matter further&#8221; Jagged asked. &#8220;No, No not yet, I think I will let the others reflect on what happened in the forum today and then, maybe two days from now, seek their &#8220;Counsel&#8221; on the matter, then things should begin to fall into place&#8221; Esquilax replied. 
<br />
<br />The social life of Rome was not with out its roses. The beautiful and fair maiden sycho_warrior was out on her families porch that over looked the forum. She could see many things that happened in the city, but was privy to only a few. She was said to have her eye on a suitor, but would not name him. Some thought it was a ruse to keep other, less desirables at bay. But, she possessed much wisdom for one so young. She was well versed in reading and sought out the more popular works published and found them informative and entertaining. &#8220;Sycho_warrior, do come inside&#8221; her mother called to her. Her last glimpse was of one of the new Senators, one Corsair, who it was rumored to side with the emperor in most matters.
<br />
<br />The Centurion, one freighter fighter, had been sent with a dispatch from the army camp near Gades, and was to give the dispatch to Senator Esquilax. He headed toward the forum, as the guard at the main gate pointed him on a route that would lead him over the Capitoline Mount. Always a beautiful site, so busy as well. 
<br />
<br />The Coliseum was in full roaring attendance. The gladiators fighting lions and each other. The &#8220;Hero&#8221; of the day was one of the Gauls called Stormtrooper. He had survived many adversaries but was now up against a Batavian of great strength and stature. Stormtrooper moved about with ease, his short sword held to his side. He watched the Batavian, paceing his moves and looked for an opening. One was all he needed and he would survive the day. The Batavian was armed with a trident, a deadly weapon in the right hands. 
<br />*
<br />The Emperor was just entering the palace. The servants knew from his expressions, that silence was in order. &#8220;I grow so weary of the senators with their disputes&#8221; Tawakalna exclaimed to the walls, his rage growing. He slammed his fist on to a marble table and turned, pointing to a servant. &#8220;Bring me Senator Corsair&#8221; he spoke to the chamberlain, &#8220;but do it discreetly, do you understand me&#8221; the threat direct. &#8220;Yes, O Caesar, it will be done&#8221; he replied and hurried off to attend the errand . He knew the back ways so as not to be seen. Failure with this would mean his head. But as he moved past the market area, a face watched, and nodded. 
<br />
<br />
<br />The dawn came over the grand city, the doves soared into the light of the golden sun, yet there was unrest below them. It was growing, this discord. This was a time of peace in Rome. Not as the time of Commodus, or Nero. But this peace was beginning to crumble. Unless providence prevailed.
<br />
<br />
<br />Senator Esquilax had just met with the Centurion and received the news he had awaited. But he had to conceive of a way to &#8220;share&#8221; the news without it appearing that he orchestrated it. He had a deep love for the people of Rome, and it often created difficult situations for him. &#8220;Begging your pardon,  Senator&#8221; his aide spoke. &#8220;Yes, Wolfy, what is it?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;There is a....stranger that wishes to see you, but would not give his name&#8221; the aide replied. &#8220;I have no time right now, send him away please&#8221; Esquilax answered. &#8220;Sir, he did ask me to say a word to you if you declined to see him&#8221; the aid added. &#8220;And what word is that&#8221;, Esquilax replied, now turning his full attention to the aide. &#8220;Praetorian&#8221; answered the aide. 
<br />
<br />The market place was abuzz with buyers and merchants. Each trying to barter and each not wanting to yield. Many people wander the market and are never noticed. A shadow crossed the street and into and alley. No one seemed to care. A ship builder kept a area, strange as it seemed, and displayed models of three ships that he could build. He had found a few customers that were interested in buying a boat, even if it took many months to build. His name was Chips. He and others that worked with him built several fine ships, including the one the Emperor himself used when he traveled. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Senator Corsair&#8221; the aide announced. Caesar was meeting him in an anti chamber rather than the main hall. &#8220;My Emperor, you sent for me&#8221; Corsair spoke, with his head bowed . Caesar motioned for the others to move closer and instructed the aide to leave the room. A large table was positioned in the center of the room adorned with all manner of delicacies. There were goblets and pitchers of wine, fruit in abundance. Tawakalna knew how to win them over. He had a plan, but it required the help of these present and a few others, but craftiness, was a must. To remove a &#8220;Thorn&#8221; in his side, he must wield the knife with skill and cunning. But, he thought, I will remove that thorn. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font></div>

			<div class="content">Well, both Taw and I have been around for a LONG time and it is natural that we would be on opposing sides of most of the great conflicts throughout history. Why? Because he sides with the forces of Darkness, while I side the forces of Right! Or something like that <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. You'll have to ask him for his point of view when he returns <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.

			<div class="content">Things aren't quite that bad Jaggy, but if you would like to join the conflict against my newest foe &quot;Druidia&quot; (or whatever the hell it is called <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), then you must first petition the Rabbit-God for a position. Did you have anything in mind? 
<br />
<br />Indy - Here is one of the many &quot;myths&quot; that were discovered on 3,000 year-old clay tablets in the late 19th century. These words were later translated, adapted, and then entered into the &quot;Book of the Rabbit&quot;. Specifically, this paragraph is from Genesis, Chapter II, Verse V...
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>&quot;And so it was that on the third day, the Rabbit-God came down from on-high in a fiery chariot that outshone the sun itself and proclaimed His Lordship and Dominion over the hopping and peaceful inhabitants of Esquilaxitavia. It is told that He then raised His paws to the heavens and cried 'Today is a Holy day! Today let the Word go forth from this time and place that Esquilaxitavia is under the protection of the Rabbit-God! Let all heed well the words of the Rabbit-God and obey well the words of His chosen priests! Now go ye forth and multiply, as only the folk of Esquilaxitavia can, in order that we may grow and prosper, and defend ourselves against those who would consume us!&quot; As He lowered his paws from the heavens, a great cry went up, and word travelled throughout the city. And so it was that the fonts and basins in the Great Cathedral burst forth and overflowed with the Holy Libation Ginger Beer, and all stood in amazement, and there was much rejoicing and consumption of carbonated beverages. And so it was that the people of the Rabbit-God proclaimed their love for Him, knowing that their patron would watch over them, and protect them from the enemies of the Rabbitfolk of which the rabbit-eating Mullah of Tawakalnistan was foremost, followed closely by the blasphemous practices of the leader of Daftopia....&quot; <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Hmm, that should really be updated to reflect the addition of the evil forces of ID... Fortunately, the Holy Work is updated frequently because Esquilaxitavia believes in a progressive belief system <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />Oghma - Thanks for the above verses. I owe ye one! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
