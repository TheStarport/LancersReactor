<br />Fictional references to the year
<br />
<br />George Orwell's dystopian satire Nineteen Eighty-Four about a future totalitarian society was set in this year. The date was chosen by transposing 1948, the year in which Orwell wrote the book. Nineteen Eighty-Four was used as an imaginary year in the future by others as well, much like 1999 and 2001 was.</div>
