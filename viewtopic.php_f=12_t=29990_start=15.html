			<div class="content">I'm sorry you lost a friend this way. I'm sorry for what your friend's wife and son will have to go through. In 95 a man I considered my mentor, friend, leader and confidant took his own life with a shotgun in his mouth. I was sorry I lost a friend, I was sorry his wife and two daughters lost the man they loved and counted on. But I have to ask you a question, Boscoe. Aren't you pissed? I couldn't tell from your post but I know when my friend took his life I was outraged that anyone could be so goddamned selfish. I have a wife, a seven year old son and a three year old daughter. The thought of purposefully leaving them without my support makes my blood run cold. The act my friend commited was one of the cruelest most heinous crimes any father can commit. He left three people who depended on him for everything with nothing but the memory that they didn't mean enough to him for him to stick around. That's just evil in my book. When I attended the funeral I sat behind his oldest daughter. I got to witness up close and personal what those kids went through. Evil. I've never witnessed such mental devestation perpetrated on another human being.
<br />I don't know about you but I'll never forgive my friend. I'll never again think about him as anything but a heartless, cruel, cowardly, EVIL bastard.
<br />When I saw that your friend had a seven year old I mentally pictured my son.
<br />How the hell is anyone going to explain to that boy why his dad did what he did? How is a seven year old going to come to grips with it? Even in twenty years how is that 27 year old going to understand why his father left him to grow up without his dad? 
<br />Over the years others close to me have told me that the fact that I don't understand why he did it is why I'm so angry about it. Personally I feel that being able to understand how anyone can do something like that to their family is impossible. 
<br />I'm not trying to tell you how to feel about your friend. Maybe you are able to feel some empathy. I just want to know if it makes you angry. I see other people in this thread have lost someone this way but I don't see any anger. Maybe you're all saints and I'm the only one who can't understand how someone can be so selfish. But thinking about what your friend did to his boy just brings back all the rage.</div>

<br />
<br />I am a newcomer to TLR compared to you.  Sorry to hear what happened to your friend and to you because of it.

			<div class="content">First of all, thanks to every one of you for your kind words.  They help, they really do!
<br />
<br />@kaegogi:  I'm certainly pissed off, but my way of showing is much different that yours.  Yes, what Arnold did was and awful and selfish act, something his son will need years of counseling to deal with.  I'm not directly angry at Arnold, just that I'm angry first at his family for being so damn stoic and raised him to never let anyone know something was wrong.  (He' s got very stiff and stoic Dutch parents).  I'm not angry at Arnold, but maybe feeling that useless guilt that &quot;I should have done more&quot; that one gets when this happens.  I'm also finding myself very easily angered and short tempered with my family, and others close to me.  I even yelled at the dogs last night for barking.  Fortunately I see a shrink for my own depressions, and this obviously will be a major topic at our next session.  I can't hold a resentment like you mentioned.  I've found that doing so just leads me to more depression and unrelieved anger.  I've spent the last two days talking, writing, crying, and just keeping busy.  
<br />
<br />If there's any silver lining here, it's that I'm getting back in touch with many people I haven't spoken to in much too long.  That includes my being an active member of TLR.  It's great to be back seeing this screen and typing out my messages again.  It's horrible that it takes tragedies like this make this happen, but I've spoken at length to friends I have lost touch with for years.  It was like we never were apart, just picked up our friendship right where we left it.  That has been the godsend of all this.</div>

			<div class="content">Welcome back my formerly conjoined robot twin.  We've all missed your insight, humor and presence here.  But you know as well as anyone once a member of this family, <b> always  </b> a member.
<br />
<br />My condolences about the news.  Sometimes even life's pitfalls find it's way onto the forums here and every single one of them are delt with sympathy and grace.  Probably one of the reasons why we can be a such a tight-nit community.  We care, that speaks volumes.

			<div class="content">I did wonder what happened to you. A while back I finally saw you come online on MSN and I said hi to you, but I found out it was your 10 year old daughter <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I asked her to say hi to you from me, don't know if that reached you though. 
<br />
<br />I just want to say I fully understand your absence and I'm really sorry for your friend. But let me say I'm also glad you found your way back to us and that you are sharing this with us. That way we can support you all the way and just be there for you. I truly hope you'll stay and if you need anything, just give me a holler. Again, I'm really sorry for your loss.</div>

			<div class="content">what a tragic tale. I can very much relate to it as I suffer from terrible black depressions myself and have quite often had to take anti-depressants for it just to break the depressive cycle of despair and lethargy. There have been many occasssions when i've considered topping myself and very nearly done it too, none of this cry for help bollocks either. However it does get easier as I get older and the guilt and traumas of the past (cos Uncle Taw isn't actually a very nice person) fade with time. The undercurrent is always there though and I find it incredibly difficult if not impossible to discuss certain matters, i suppose that's very unhealthy but I don't hold with all this cathartic &quot;face your fears&quot; rubbish. I'd rather get hammered and lost in the dark milk of intoxicated oblivion, thank you very much.</div>
