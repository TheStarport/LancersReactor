			<div class="content">this is my 2nd story (1st one written a while back ,never made it past the first chapter) i've had little experience in these things but constructive criticism is welcome.
<br />
<br />Hal Reiver strolled into the bar on freeport one. He had served for many years in the police forces of all the major houses, and had plenty of combat experience. He had also been part of The Order, though he'd now resigned and was freelancing a life much more interesting then it had been for a long time. He'd been contacted anominously by an untracable caller. It's message simply read:
<br />
<br />Come to the Bar on Freeport one and go to table 3. if you do anything else, you will be terminated.
<br />
<br />Hal didn't like the sound of 'terminated'. If he took it as meaning to be killed, it sounded very impersonal, like someone who thought you were inferior to them.
<br />
<br />If the Order hadn't been sending him updates everyweek, he'd have suspected nomads. but no, last update said that the hypergate had been inactive for a while, and all nomads traced entering through had been sharply dealt with.
<br />
<br />Hal sighed, pulled up a map of the bar on his pad, found table three, and headed towards it. However, as he drew closer, he saw he wasn't going to be alone at it. there were three more pilots. he recognised there was one Liberty pilot, a woman with a serious look on her, one Rhinelander, a rugged man, who was hunched over a glass of Nitro Fuel (the latest rage in the colonys, Hal had never seen the appeal in it though) and finally a Kusarian, with that haunted look you get after having seen many people die.
<br />
<br />&quot;Interesting.&quot; he thought, &quot;If you include me, thats a representation of all the houses&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hi&quot; he said sitting down
<br />The Libertian looked at him
<br />&quot;What are you doing here Bretonian?&quot;
<br />&quot;I got a message from someone to meet here&quot;
<br />The woman looked surprised
<br />&quot;Did the message look like this?&quot; she asked, handing him her datapad.
<br />&quot;Yes, thats it exactly&quot;
<br />&quot;Ah. My name is Kath, Kath Walker. And this,&quot; she said indicating the Rhienlander &quot;is Wolfe von Hittsun&quot;
<br />&quot;Hello&quot; rumbled Wolfe
<br />Kath turned to the Kusarian
<br />&quot;And is...&quot; she began
<br />&quot;Morita Kaito&quot; he interupted, &quot;but most people oustide of Kusari call me Morris&quot;
<br />
<br />The initial introductions over,they started chatting about their experiences so far. Hal and Morris started arguing over the current contest for power around Harrison between Bretonia and Kusari. 
<br />&quot;it's a viable military tactic!&quot; Hal exclaimed, &quot;Minefields are legal.&quot;
<br />Morris calmly sipped his drink
<br />&quot;that is true but only if they have adaquete warning around them. i believe a few civilian ships were destroyed by the mines, which arn't singleship class mines, those mines are designed to destroy battleships. which means that there should be an exclusion zone of 10 km around the edges.&quot;
<br />&quot;but thats like a quarantine! 10 km from the mine belt give about 10m maneuvering space outside of Harris's Atmosphere!&quot;
<br />Kath reached over
<br />&quot;Stop arguing, we're being given funny looks&quot;
<br />&quot;sorry&quot;
<br />&quot;sorry&quot;
<br />
<br />it was at that point they all simultaeniously recived a call.
<br />
<br />end chapter 1!</div>

<br />
<br />After the second chime, Kath sighed and pulled out a strange looking device from her pocket. Noticing the other's surprised looks, she plugged it the front of her data pad. The instant the activation lights came on, lines of light emitted from each 'pad.
<br />
<br />&quot;Call synchronizer&quot; she explained &quot;latest civilian project&quot;
<br />A much thicker line shot out of her datapad, hit the centre of the table and the inbuilt hologram projecter activated. A figure wearing a grey robe popped into existence.
<br />&quot;Greetings&quot; the figure said. the voice had a slightly metallic tone to it.
<br />&quot;Why's it using a voice synthesizer?&quot; thought Hal
<br />&quot;You four have been selected to go beyond the immediate boundries of the Sirius Sector. Into the fringes of deep space. You will not have to go far. This is a simple exploration mission.&quot;
<br />The voice was sounding more and more like the automated mission readers to Hal.
<br />&quot;However, Deep space is uncharted. We recommend stockpiling on ammo and supplies. If you choose to decline this mission, your short further existence in this universe will be very painful.&quot;
<br />&quot;I guess thats a yes from all of us&quot; Hal said, looking at the other pilot's faces.
<br />&quot;Excellent. we have discovered a jump hole that will take you most of the way. co-ordinates have been uploaded onto your neural net. Call me for help, or further instructions when you are done.&quot; the figure exclaimed beginning to fade.
<br />&quot;Wait!&quot; shouted Kath, &quot;What's your name?&quot;
<br />The robed figure turned towards her.
<br />&quot;My name, is not important&quot; the figure hissed, then vanished from view.
<br />&quot;What a wierd name, Not Important!&quot; said Wolfe, attempting to brighten the mood.
<br />&quot;Come on, lets go.&quot; sighed Kath, wiring the bill and a tip to the barman.
<br />
<br />They walked to the hangar in silence. then spotting something amusing, Hal spoke up.
<br />
<br />&quot;look at that starflier&quot; said Hal
<br />&quot;whoa, I'm suprised its still nearly in one piece.&quot; grinned Morris
<br />&quot;i'm pretty sure that's duct-tape holding that wing on.&quot; said Kath &quot;it looks like if enough people look at it, it'll collapse&quot;
<br />it was at that moment the Wolfe had a look as well. the ship collapsed into a heap of debris.
<br />
<br />&quot;let's run now&quot;
<br />
<br />a few metres away from that heavily borrowed from H2G2G (hitchhikers guide to the galaxey for those who don't know the abbreviation) scene, the writer decided to return to his normal writing style
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah heres my ship!&quot; Hal said happily. &quot;a Corsair Titan, complete with v10 gravitrons and a balanced weapons range. capable of blowing most ships to pieces within a few seconds. And&quot; he added, taking out a button, &quot;remote starting&quot; he pressed it and the engines flared into life.
<br />&quot;I don't see any missles.&quot; said Morris
<br />&quot;Never trusted them&quot; said Hal, leaping into the cockpit and pressing a few buttons. The engines switched off , the loading doors of the cargo bay opened and a loading crane moved to the operational position. Hal sent an order for food and water and climbed out of the VHF.
<br />
<br />Nothing could've prepared him for Kath's ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;A NOMAD FIGHTER?&quot;
<br />&quot;Captured. its nice and light to handle, and i was able to graft a shield on it.&quot;
<br />&quot;so how do you get in and control it?&quot;
<br />&quot;you don't really. you touch it, and sort of, hard to expain, merge yourself with it.&quot;
<br />&quot;Sounds nasty&quot;
<br />&quot;it's wierd the first time, but i'm used to it now. watch.&quot;
<br />She laid a hand on a panel (&quot;did it purr? or was that just my imagination?&quot; thought Hal) and appeared to concentrate. She slowly dissapeared from view. however, when she was completely gone, the fighter seemed actually alive. Hal could swear it was now breathing.
<br />&quot;you see,&quot; said Kath's voice inside Hal's head &quot;it's now like controlling a body. at least i won't need food, until i get out&quot;
<br />&quot;Hal, where's Kath?&quot; shouted Wolfe
<br />Hal said nothing but pointed towards her (&quot;No! its not her, it's her fighter, is it?&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />&quot;Hold on no playing arou...&quot; he cursed in his native tounge &quot; you're saying that she's... one of THEM?&quot;
<br />&quot;No, I'm not a nomad.&quot; said Kath, phasing out of her ship. &quot;it's just one of their ships. and a unique controlling method. where's your ship?&quot;
<br />&quot;being patched up, i ran into some hackers on the way here.&quot;
<br />&quot;much damage?&quot;
<br />&quot;not really, though my engine is breached and at least two of my weapons are in-operable.
<br />&quot;yeeesh. what sort of ship?&quot;
<br />&quot;valkyrie&quot;
<br />&quot;of course&quot;
<br />The was a large crashing noise from outside the station
<br />&quot;what the hell was that?&quot; screamed Hal, from the floor
<br />&quot;Morris here, i had a little accident with a cruiser. shield generator is busted and ship hull needs major repairs&quot;
<br />&quot;how'd it happen?&quot; Wolfe asked
<br />&quot;from what i'm recieving it was because of a faulty tradelane ring, which didn't slow them down enough for the exit. the Zoners are deactivating the lanes here until maitenence from Agiera get here. so we're stuck until they arrive.
<br />&quot;rodger that. need assistance getting back?&quot;
<br />&quot;yeh, engine isn't turning over. looks like the fuel link has been severed.&quot;
<br />&quot;i'll get him. my titans fitted with a tow.&quot; volunteered Hal
<br />&quot;Go ahead, i'm not stopping you&quot; said Morris. &quot;Hey sounds like they're willing to pay for the damage.&quot;
<br />
<br />Half a minute later and Hal was in space.
<br />&quot;Hal, i have a visual on you, i'm on your 8.&quot;
<br />&quot;copy that. is your tractor beam still online?&quot;
<br />&quot;Checking... Yeh, its online. Why?&quot;
<br />&quot;little trick i learnt in the Bretonian Armed Forces. i'm releasing the tow, tractor it onto your ship.&quot;
<br />&quot;can't you just link up usually?&quot;
<br />&quot;not with that amount of fuel around you. my engines would cause it to explode&quot;
<br />&quot;tractoring now&quot;
<br />The space around Hals ship hummed as a lance of energy danced from Morris' ship. Hal scanned the ship, knowing that an external reading would be more accurate then internal as Morris' computer had most likly recieved damage.
<br />&quot;oooh. a Chimera. nice. well, lets see, shield's are gone, engine is actually completly off your ship. and starboard wing is buckled.&quot;
<br />&quot;shut up and get me inside.&quot;
<br />&quot;yessir&quot;
<br />
<br />Hal manevered Morris' Chimera into a dry dock and then watched as the service cranes moved the ship into a repair slot in the hangar.
<br />
<br />after landing himself, Hal ran to Kath and Wolfe who were inspecting the two damaged ships.
<br />Kath turned around
<br />&quot;Ah Hal, i have managed to contact our contractor. he wasn't happy but he accepts we have to stay until repairs are complete and tradelanes are back up. meanwhile, we're to get some rest.&quot;
<br />&quot;seperate rooms?&quot;asked Morris.
<br />&quot;yes, all adjaecent. luckily. leave the datapads on, i've asked the dockmaster to notify us when your ships are ready.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Hal was doozing peacefully in his room when he recieved a call from the station AI
<br />&quot;This is Dockmaster 1A7. The Valkyrie belonging to Wolfe Von Hittsun has had it's repairs complete. The repairs to the Chimera belonging to Morita Kaito are 75% complete. thank you&quot;
<br />Hal woke up, cursed the fact he'd hadn't set the sleep setting on incoming calls (only calls that were of high priority would be let through).
<br />&quot;oh well, seeing as i'm awake i might as well head to the recreation room&quot; he thought gloomily. &quot;there's probably an e-book to read or something.&quot;
<br />suddenly his datapad piped up again.
<br />&quot;Hal, this is urgent!&quot; Wolfes voice filtered through the speaker, &quot;come down to the hangar.&quot;
<br />&quot;ok, what is it?&quot;
<br />&quot;an attack!&quot;
<br />&quot;on a freeport? are they crazy?&quot; then Hal remembered freeport 7 &quot;Nomads?&quot;
<br />&quot;no, their not like anything i've seen before.&quot;
<br />&quot;damn. Hold on&quot;
<br />
<br />Hal ran down the hall way and jumped into the lift. however, he was getting suspicious of lack of alarms, running pilots and escape pods launching.
<br />and he was very suspicious of the fact, that when he got to a window, there were no explosions or any unidentified ships. still he ran to the hangar.
<br />there he met Wolfe who was grinning.
<br />&quot;got you&quot; he chuckled, &quot;anyway&quot; he continued, serious now &quot;we've been placed on standby, Kath and Morris are on their way. Morris' ship has nearly been fully repaired, technically its battle ready, but they're yet to replace the wing.&quot;
<br />&quot;don't do that again&quot; growled Hal
<br />they watched in silence as the new purple wing was fitted to the ship. Target diagnostic went without a hitch as each and every drone was destroyed.
<br />&quot;Good as new&quot; grinned a mechanic.
<br />&quot;Great&quot; said Morris gleefully, &quot;without further ado, lets launch&quot;
<br />
<br />ah , what words can describe the majesty of Omega 3 system in the early morning, as freeport 1 rotated so the inhabitants felt simulated dawn in accordnance with standard time. and the light glinting of the 3 metallic and one crystaline ship was sublime. that is, it was till you heard the trasmissions between each ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bad news fellas, tradelanes are still offline&quot; transmitted Kath.
<br />&quot;Damn!&quot; shouted Hal. &quot;Well i'm not waiting. form up on me!&quot;
<br />the others complied and soon they were cruising the route that the tradelane took.
<br />
<br />End Chapter the 2ndest!
<br />please note, i'm trying to keep this as accurate to the Discovery Mod universe as possible. i can't remeber if Omega 3 has tradelanes or not. so any correctionment will be noted</div>

			<div class="content">here it is... sorry if there are delays with the next few chapters, i'm making the plot up as i go along O.o
<br />
<br />Chapter the umpteenth. Oh wait. The 3rd
<br />
<br />&quot;according to the mission profile, the jumphole we have to take is around here...&quot; mused Kath
<br />they had entered cambridge, encountered a few battleship patrols, seen off a lot of Mollys and nearly ran into one of bretonia's experiments in cloaking.
<br />&quot;initiating long range scanners... Alert! unknown contacts! they don't look dangerous, but stay on your guard!&quot; shouting Hal
<br />&quot;found them&quot; replied Wolfe, &quot;painting them as hostiles to increase their visibility. but don't engage.&quot;
<br />&quot;Jeez,&quot; breathed Morris &quot;what are they? they don't look human, but their metallic. There's no cockpit either... i'm not picking up any weaponry... shall we hail them?&quot;
<br />&quot;i don't see any reason to worship them.&quot; grunted Hal
<br />&quot;so you haven't watched the antique star trecks yet?&quot;
<br />&quot;nope&quot;
<br />&quot;alert!&quot; shouted kath &quot;the contacts... they're changing!&quot;
<br />indeed they were. their wings lengthened, their engine swelled to twice their previous size and weapons started popping up out of compartments. a strange voice, over the radio speakers said
<br />&quot;your destruction shall be but a ripple in the ocean of revenge!&quot;
<br />then they opened fire. Hal shields went down after the first salvo. the next passed through empty space as he thrusted upwards.
<br />&quot;i've found the jumphole!&quot; yelled kath &quot;uploading coodinates now! just dock with it. don't engage the enemy, they're too strong!&quot;
<br />&quot;rodger that&quot; said Hal opening up his cruise engines, as another lot of enemy gunfire missed due to a strafe. he opened up a screen from a camera that was tracking the others. to his relief they too had activated cruise. however, there was something headed towards Wolfe. it wasn't a laser... he zoomed in. it looked awfully like a... oh s***!
<br />&quot;Wolfe your gonna get disrupted!&quot;
<br />the disrupter exploded.
<br />&quot;all systems are offline! Weapons, engines, shields and comms are offline! i'm having to use a datapad! losing signal...&quot; Wolfe panicking voice faded from hearing.
<br />&quot;Damn! an EMP!&quot; swore Hal &quot;Computer, get me a firing solution. weapon: tow rope, target: Wolfe!&quot;
<br />&quot;Acknowleged.&quot; droned the computer &quot;please exit cruise&quot;
<br />Hal swore again. but already, missiles, lasers and even what looked like torpedos where heading towards Wolfe's ship.
<br />&quot;thank gods their weapons move so slow!&quot; he thought.
<br />&quot;Hal, this is Kath. Morris and i have gone through. where're you and wolfe? we're not picking up a signal from him. is he... gone?&quot;
<br />&quot;not yet&quot; said Hal through gritted teeth.
<br />he exited cruise and fired the tow at Wolfe. there was a satisfying 'clunk' as it attatched too his ship.
<br />&quot;thanks Hal!&quot; wolfes voice crackled, &quot;i'm using direct link on the pad, only way to get through. lets GO! theres five seconds to impact!&quot;
<br />Hal swore again and punched his cruise activation button. the engines hummed as they charged up... only not fast enough.
<br />&quot;4 seconds to impact&quot;
<br />&quot;garn it! computer, divert all power into the engines!&quot;
<br />&quot;acknowleged&quot;
<br />&quot;3 seconds&quot;
<br />&quot;2&quot;
<br />&quot;1&quot;
<br />the cruise engines finally caught light and speared Hal's ship foward. the tow lost all slack and lanked Wolfes ship out of the way of the incoming projectiles. well most of them.
<br />&quot;i've been hit! losing life support i think!&quot; and indeed there was a background hissing noise to the transmission
<br />&quot;hold on!&quot; shouted Hal and plunged into the jumphole
<br />the enemy fighters stopped just short of the jump hole
<br />&quot;shall we follow them?&quot;
<br />&quot;no need. they will die quicker anyway. and now lets recon the economic hub of this civilisation. if that should accidently fall, then millions upon millions will starve and our grand vengance shall have started.&quot;
<br />that end of the line broke into manical laughter, while the rest of the wing edged nervously away from it.
<br />
<br />end of 3rd chapter
<br />cor, this plot lark is hard. any suggestions?</div>

			<div class="content">i don't want to sound impatient, but is anyone reading this? well ihers 4th for any1 that cares.
<br />
<br />chapter 4
<br />&quot;Exiting jumphole.&quot; stated Hal's computer. the flashing blue and yellow tube around the craft began to fade, and a hole through which normal space could be seen had appeared. His ship broke through and he was sent flying forwards with the force of decelaration. then he flew forward again, as Woles ship rear ended him.
<br />&quot;Sorry&quot; shouted Wolfe
<br />Kath drifted closer. &quot;that looks nasty, we'd better get you repaired.&quot;
<br />&quot;Where though? infact, where in Sirius are we?&quot;
<br />&quot;Nav map is going crazy, hold on... picking up a station... looks like it's human? out here?&quot;
<br />&quot;is it manned?&quot;
<br />&quot;can't see from here. we have to get closer. Hal? you have a Discovery scanner, what can you see?&quot;
<br />&quot;hmm. its aged it as being here for 100 years. and yes it is manned, but has been heavily damaged over the years... also i'm picking up smaller items... what look like really old weapon platforms.&quot; Hal read out. &quot;Kath? Contact the Mission CO and see what he says about it.&quot;
<br />a few minutes passed, in which Hal preformed a scan as far out as the scanner went. it's results were inconclusive ( long range scans where notoriusly vague) but he dectected what looked like an asteroid field, and at least one planet.
<br />&quot;the CO says to dock with it. its presence here is top secret, but is kept well supplied. apperantly their not happy about you picking them up Hal.&quot;
<br />&quot;really?&quot;
<br />&quot;yeh, they want to have a look at your scanner, to see how to block it in future. you weren't supposed to pick up lifesigns. it's disguise was an old disused station.&quot;
<br />&quot;figures&quot;
<br />&quot;yeh,&quot; snorted Morris &quot;as if anyone comes out here anyway.&quot;
<br />&quot;the order does...&quot; said Kath meekly
<br />&quot;what!?&quot;
<br />&quot;its sort of a border station for Sirius itself, like the Osiris stationed by the Hyper gate&quot;
<br />&quot;hmm&quot;
<br />&quot;there are more of them. no faction knows about each other, except for high command. their only to discover each other if one fails to contain a threat to sirius...&quot;
<br />&quot;how'd you know all this stuff?&quot; asked Hal
<br />&quot;i just got told it, by the CO, which means either A. he's one of the high command of the order, or B. he knows too much.&quot;
<br />&quot;how come they didn't notice the stuff on the news about the Nomad order?&quot;
<br />&quot;its remote out here, and i guess their suppliers were told not to tell them.&quot;
<br />&quot;hmm, seems to me like the Author is now just trying to get his story to fit in with the main one!&quot;
<br />&quot;quiet! he doesn't like out of character stuff!&quot;
<br />*Kracka-boom!*
<br />&quot;See?&quot;
<br />&quot;sorry&quot;
<br />&quot;whatever, lets just dock!&quot;
<br />end chapter the 4th
<br />sorry about breaking the 4th wall there, i couldn't help it.</div>
