<br />I would just like to quote a couple of passages that I came upon, *Ahem*:
<br />&quot;I cant get milkshape to work! It just crashes whenever I try to run it. &quot;
<br />&quot;Milkshape wont start up. Why? ...why? why? why?&quot;
<br />&quot;But why cant I select a face to make into a hard point when I'm in 3D view?&quot;
<br />&quot;Also, when I select a face, it highlights all the faces that are aligned tothat one all the way to the other side. Why?&quot;

<br />Oh, and no I don't think there is, you'll have to export anyway.

			<div class="content">My room-mate being something of a visual artist, i gave the task of 3d modeling for my mod over to him.  I can sort of use milkshape (i made a cylinder ship once), but I'm not very good at it.  We're still stuck on textures, (like why they load in some areas of the ship and not others, when we've triple checked to make sure there are no more inverted faces!!!).  But yeah, I stick to the ini stuff, and he does the graphics (although I do the hardpoints since he finds it tedious and is never sure which faces to duplicate for it).  I have lightwave 7 and he loathes it, he loves milkshape.  lol.  but then he does this stuff on a 233 laptop with windows 98, while i do the text editing on my p4...  kind of ironic no?  I don't lightwave would even allow itself to be installed on his computer heh.</div>

			<div class="content">milkshape is perhaps one of the greatest 3d modelling programs to learn how to model.  But when people from other platforms try to use it they're used to some of the extra bells and wistles which milkshape doesn't have.  
<br />
<br />Personally, I never used a 3d modelling program before milkshape, and have never tried modelling anything before it, I dled milkshape and learned how to use it strictly for the purpose of mkaing ships for freelancer, inwhich with almost everyship I learned something new or a better/quicker way to have done it in milkshape.  After using milkshape I did try a number of other 3d moddelling programs (lightwave, 3ds max, gmax, maya PLE, autocad, formz, solidworks (god I love university computers in the structural enginneering lab) and cinema 4d).  But, interms of just making low poly ships, milkshape is still one of the best, the other programs tend to have 80% of it's material interms of making it easy to deal with high poly models, and not that useful in regards to what you want to do.  In milkshape, you make what you want, nothing special.  (BTW, for all you who are complaining bout not being able to edit in 3d space, milkshape 2.0 is going to have those capabilities when it's released)  another btw, there are a number of tools and plugins which don't come with milkshape which are just circulating on the forum.  This includes two different non official update packs for milkshape 1.7.0, so you might wanna look round there for some of those tools.  Personally the texture refresh plugin is one of the best things bout milkshape though doesn't come right with it, have to dl it seperately.  There are some people who are maxing out there milkshape with over 100 different plugins, so before you start complaining about milkshapes abilites, you should look into what abilities it actually has, only prob though that I admit is a lot of the plugins are smeared across the years of posts on the forum, so you have to do some work to find them all lol.
<br />
<br />Personally I learned to model strictly for the purpose of making ships for freelancer, right now I'm learning how to use cinema 4d because I can take nice renders in it, and possibly make some nice animations. (Btw, all you guys who post up pics of your ships, c4d has a free demo version, which while you can't save your work it never stops to work, you CAN still use all the advanced rendering capabilities of it, so no reason to post 'crappy' looking pics, take a good render of it)  
<br />
<br />But these two programs are perhaps the best two I've used, milkshape for low poly work, and cinema 4d is certainly my favorite out of all the &quot;higher-end&quot; modelling programs.  All of the ships I have hosted on my <a href='http://home.earthlink.net/~enlight10ment/index.html' Target=_Blank>webspace</a> are made in milkshape with the exception of the newest ship heretic, cause I was transfering it back and forth between milkshape and c4d. conversely the oldest ship, Black_thunder, is the first thing I ever made using a 3dmoddeling program.  Kinda fun going back and looking at how the designs and efficiency of the models I made have improved over time. 
<br />
<br />And just to have a little blab bout the original topic, nope, no cmp exporter for 3ds max, you have to export from max into one of the dozens of formats milkshape can import, then export it to freelancer, But truth of the matter, just not having a export from max to freelancer really doesn't matter much, you can still pretty much competely make your entire model in 3dsmax and do a very simple and fast converstion between the two programs no sweat and no extra work, I think the majority of the people who can't figure out how easy it is to transfer projects between various programs and milkshape, mostlikely have that problem because they never bought or registered milkshape and their demo ran out, hence where the real problem comes in <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">no you don't have to, you could just make the hardpoints in another program as you would have made them in milkshape.  Also, you don
<br />t make you texture in milkshape, you make your textures in a program like photoshop.  You uv unwrap it in whatever program you are most familiar with or want to use.  If you are using 3ds max, then one would assume you know how to uv unwrap in it and make seperate groupings for hardpoints.  Once you are done, just export into one of the multitudes of formats milkshape can open, and then export again to cmp.  All you have to do in milkshape is export it to cmp, anything else you can do using anyother program, it's just up to you inwhich program you think you can use easiest to preform the operations.</div>

			<div class="content">lol - i didn't make any ships at all. The models mainly were from other poeple - like Firebase, Giskard, Wanderer, Caid, and Paul.
<br />
<br />However, now PantherX has joined us, and Osprey too, oh - and Illero as well <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> - so the models are made by them (well, mainly by panther at the mo - who has made about 10 models for us <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />I did convert all NPC ships to be flyable by players, and i do all the ini work for those ships (i get the CMP file and Mat file, and take it from there), but in the <b>REAL    </b> making of ships, i have no hand in (well, apart from the odd &quot;ooo&quot; and &quot;arrrhhh!&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">said time and time again, you can do it in any 3d modelling program you want, but for someone who advocates so strongly against milkshape and it's &quot;hard of use&quot; and other programs being easier, you really should try using it sometime and see how easy it can do this <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Select face you want, duplicate (ctrl-d), that's it and all, if other programs can do it easier, then use them, but ease of use is dictated by knowedge of how to use the program, and if you don't know how to copy and paste things well in 3ds, only shows that milkshape would be an easier option for you to use.
