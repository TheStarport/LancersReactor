			<div class="content">Chapter 4: Strange Openings
<br />
<br />Track and Alice were being escorted back to New Berlin by Gamma 1 in his fighter, the two pilots flying alongside with an eager feeling of wanting to know what was going on.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Rheinland Intelligence located a jump hole in the nebula, one that was rather unstable, but was suspected to become useable over time. It became active at least a few months ago, and they sent in a wing of fighters to look around.
<br />
<br />&#8220;They ended up in the middle of a large radioactive nebula, although the gas did not affect their fighters much at all. Located nearby was an Outcast base with two ports and a large fighter wing compliment. The fighter wing immediately broke off and headed back into the jump hole, returning to New Berlin and telling them everything. The Outcasts seem to know about the jump hole too, and they seemed to be ready for outfitting a base on the other side of the jump hole. Why they needed two dock yards for capitol ships, I don&#8217;t know.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We were planning on using those science ships as a cover for heading into the nebula and looking around, seeing what they had put up already. We know that they have at least a forward outpost with some sentry guns and a large wing of fighters. Rheinland Intelligence thinks the force is sizeable enough to take on our forces here in the New Berlin system. If they did that, and managed to seal off the exits out of here, we would be in for some serious trouble. We need to take over the jump hole in the nebula, seal it off, and destroy any remaining Outcasts in the area once it is complete.&#8221; Gamma 1 completed his story, and topped it off with a confirming click on his comm.
<br />
<br />Track sat back in his seat, switched to autopilot, and did some reflecting.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait&#8230;&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You are going to ask us to do something for you, aren&#8217;t you? Otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t have called us back to base.&#8221; Track commented.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not a special assignment, but I am giving you each command of your own squads. Your objectives will vary from one thing to the next, but this thing with the Outcasts has made our forces move over to tactical deployment. We are going to need our best pilots out there.&#8221; Gamma 1 explained. Alice made a bit of noise on her comm, as if to wonder what her part in all of this was.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Rheinland Command will give you your assignments when you get back to base. I am just the messenger. Not a lot of other pilots know about this. They think this was a simple exploration and science mission, and Outcasts just so happened to be in the area. Lets keep it that way until further notice.&#8221; Gamma 1 ordered. Track and Alice confirmed, and they continued on their heading for the New Berlin docking ring.
<br />
<br />Track set his fighter down on the landing pad gently, and he watched as Alice flew overhead and landed on the pad beyond the building he was staring at. He was less concentrated on the mission at hand, and more concentrated on the little get-together they were planning on having, but he dismissed the thought when he remembered that they probably wouldn&#8217;t have the time. This was a serious threat to Rheinland Security, and the New Berlin Intelligence Council was probably aware, but the neighboring systems might not have a clue what was going on. Rheinland Systems were usually viewed as able to take care of themselves, due to the vast military size. But Track was wondered if they would have the means to combat a large-forced nemesis, let alone the fact that they might be using Sabre fighters in the struggle.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What now?&#8221; Track heard a familiar voice call to him from his left. He looked, and Alice stood there, her hands on her hips and her long brown hair waving with the wind as it breezed around the buildings.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I guess we head over to Fleet Command. They will probably want something out of us.&#8221; Track mentioned. Alice nodded, and then started to head back for the landing bay.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait, they probably don&#8217;t want us over there in our ships. Gamma 1 said this was a covert assignment. Better if we took a civilian vehicle so no one will identify our fighters.&#8221; Track recommended. Alice raised an eyebrow.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You really are taking this seriously aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Alice asked. Track looked around, kind of trying to avoid the question.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I take a lot of things seriously, since a lot of things I used to do were quite serious.&#8221; Track explained. Alice nodded, shifted her thighs to the left from her right, and then turned around.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well I don&#8217;t care what you say. I&#8217;m taking my fighter over to Command whether you recommend it or not. I don&#8217;t think anyone is checking.&#8221; Alice sighed, waved Track off as she walked back towards her landing pad. Track shook his head and followed her.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I might as well just fly with you since I have my fighter already parked in the hangar.&#8221; Track said. Alice continued on until she reached the landing pad, clamored into her fighter with Track following behind her and jumping in the rear cockpit. Alice started the flight sequence and lifted the craft off the ground. Track fastened himself in, and Alice took off.
<br />
<br />Track was fiddling with his thumbs in the back of the ship, and wondering if Alice still remembered was she said earlier. She shifted in her seat and then spoke up over the tension Track was feeling.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Remember what I told you Track&#8230; about getting together some time&#8230;&#8221; she asked. Track nodded and let out a &#8220;Uh huh&#8221; in the process. Alice smiled a bit. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I had been planning something like this for a while now. The last time we went out somewhere, you were too drunk to do anything so I just took you home.&#8221; She laughed at the thought of Track stumbling over his own feet through the halls, complete out of it and speaking nonsense.
<br />
<br />&#8220;But you and me&#8230;&#8221; she said &#8220;We have been seeing each other for a while now&#8230; I think we could try something for a change.&#8221; She looked back at Track as he sat there childishly in the seat.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Maybe afterwards we could do something else. I think I could grow up living with you Track. You&#8217;re a nice guy.&#8221; Alice commented. Track felt very small at this point, having Alice doing all the talking and speaking of sex and long relationships. Track just nodded again. The fighter danced over the air in New Berlin and slowed down as they came closer to Rheinland Command.
<br />
<br />&#8220;They give all the soldiers some prep time before every assignment, at least a day, and I think we could squeeze our time into that one day.&#8221; Alice suggested. Track perked up and said &#8220;Ok&#8221; quickly. He felt like she was, indeed, in control of what they did and how they did it and when they did it. Track felt like saying something stupid.
<br />
<br />&#8220;At least you know I&#8217;m not after you because you&#8217;re rich.&#8221; Track laughed. Alice also laughed at the thought of pathetic rich men asking to marry her just because she was one of them. She thought that she joined the military to get out of a life of being waited on hand and foot and do something else in the world.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That is true. Which reminds me, how long have we been dating?&#8221; she asked. Track counted back his years of service in the Rheinland Military. It dated back at least three years. He met Alice when she was a new recruit in the patrol service two years ago. After some time as friends they had at least grown fond of each other at that point. Track never knew the official date of when they started seeing each other on more personal notices, but it went back a while. Track guessed a number.
<br />
<br />&#8220;A year.&#8221; He commented. Alice nodded. It must have been that long. She didn&#8217;t quite know the date either, but after some time together they had hit on each other more often than not. It was becoming quite regular to see each other&#8217;s faces when turning the corner. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re here.&#8221; She said. Track looked out the window. Rheinland Command glistened with search lights placed on all four corners of the base&#8217;s square foundation. The docking bay nearby signaled them in, and Alice maneuvered the Valkyrie towards the large opening roof doors, set the ship down, and shut off the engine. Alice and Track hopped out of the ship, and an officer approached them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The general wishes to see you immediately. He has been expecting you.&#8221; He said quickly. Track and Alice looked at each other, and then nodded and followed the officer.</div>

<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />Chapter 5: Reveal the Truth
<br />
<br />Track followed silently behind the Rheinland officer, keeping a close proximity to Alice. He nudged up to her side, and she looked him the eyes. Neither had any idea what was going on. They expected their arrival to seem more on-time, but it seems they have been expected much earlier.
<br />
<br />The officer hit a switch next to a set of doors, and a clank noise rose up a shaft, and an elevator came up behind the doors. The doors opened quickly, and the officer motioned them inside. Track and Alice walked in slowly, stopping when they were inside. The officer hit the switch again, and the doors closed in front of them. They were left alone on the elevator as it skimmed the walls down the shaft.
<br />
<br />Alice eyeballed Track out of the corner of her eye, and Track looked back at her. Both had no idea what was going on, nor what was going to happen. Rheinland Command was rumored to be far underground, and it was apparent this is where they were going.
<br />
<br />The elevator came to a half, and the large doors opened. When they stepped out, what they saw astounded them. The entire Rheinland Command was stationed in a massive complex underground. There were at least four levels, each room massively large with hundreds and hundreds of workers moving about. Another officer, this one a bit smaller than the last, approached them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Please come with me.&#8221; He asked them. Track and Alice exchanged glances, and then followed him further along. He reached a set of double doors, punched in a code on a nearby keypad, and the doors opened slowly. Track and Alice were motioned forward, and they continued along the hallway that led to a much larger room.
<br />
<br />Inside, there was a set of seats, a desk, and a large chair behind it. The chair swiveled around, showing a man dressed formally sitting in it. He sat up strait, and Track and Alice assumed he was their superior officer. They both instinctively saluted.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ah, some of our two best pilots in the fleet. Welcome to Rheinland Fleet Command. My congratulations on having made it this far in the chain of command.&#8221; The General stood up and extended a hand. Track curiously took him up on his handshake. The General behind the desk seemed rather cheerful and forthcoming.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You both know why I called you hear, but in case you have forgotten, we have a bit of a rodent problem that needs to be taken care of.&#8221; The General explained. Track and Alice nodded.
<br />
<br />&#8220;As you saw, Outcast ships are slowly moving from this nebula, and into Rheinland open space. We first came into contact with them when they attacked supply convoys from various groups. Their escort fighters were unable to save the transports, but made it back to the dockyards to inform them of their story.&#8221; The General finished the main part of his speech.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Listen, I&#8217;m giving you both command of your own part of the fleet. We know from your service records you have proven yourself outstanding field commanders, as well as pilots in our service. Other then that, Track&#8217;s record of service with Outcast ships in the past may come in handy.&#8221; The General smiled.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That is generous of you sir&#8230;&#8221; Alice started. The General held up his hand.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No need to thank me. It is I who should be thanking you. You have done a favor to this navy, and as such I&#8217;m letting you have your part done to protect it.&#8221; The General put a set of documents on his desk.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Open it.&#8221; He said. Track and Alice looked at each other, and then reached for the document. It was a folder with various papers inside of it. Track was the first to grab one of the sheets of paper, and looked it over. It contained fleet intelligence of the size and support of the 36th Ravens. Behind it, attached, were slips of paper containing every pilot&#8217;s record, every weapon in their arsenal, every speck of data they had recovered in their service with the Rheinland 2nd Fleet.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You are giving me command of the 36th Ravens?&#8221; he asked. The General nodded, and Track looked back at the papers unbelievingly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The old commander of the fleet passed away at least a week ago. We have been looking for a new replacement with decent combat experience. You do understand this is a large promotional jump. You will be moving from Captain to Rear Admiral. Alice, your part in all of this is to serve directly under Track&#8217;s command. You will run fleet preparations and tactical deployment.&#8221; The General finished.
<br />
<br />Alice looked at the General quizzically, and then back at Track, who shrugged. She nodded, smiled, and said &#8220;thank you&#8221;. The General seemed happy to accommodate their promotion, and sat down.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You will have at least a few days to think over, and of course, read over, your new assignment. Everything you need to know is in that folder. Some of our best are in that squadron, along with a handful of covert ops specialists who have been working with the Rheinland Command and Fleet Intelligence for years. Utilize your teams accordingly to skills. Dismissed.&#8221; The General waved them out, and Track and Alice saluted, then walked out.
<br />
<br />They both looked at each other, disbelieving. The priority commander of Rheinland Command just promoted them to Rear Admiral and gave them command of their own squadron within the 2nd Fleet. Either command wanted their service bad, or they had stopped being promoted around a year ago, and this was just a way to make up for it. Who knew.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Looks like we&#8217;ll have more than a day to think this over.&#8221; Track said, staring down the hallway.
<br />
<br />&#8220;And us?&#8221; Alice asked. She nudged up against Track and moved herself alongside him. Track looked back down at her, and she smiled innocently.
<br />
<br />&#8220;First thing when we get home&#8230;&#8221; he laughed. Alice laughed as well, and both of them trotted out of Rheinland Command and headed back up the service lift to the surface.</div>
