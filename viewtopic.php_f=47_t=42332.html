			<div class="content">Uh-oh---he's at it again!
<br />
<br />YessirreeBob, I've started yet another fan fic for your reading pleasure. It is entitled 'Freelancer: Beyond&quot; and it is a sequel to &quot;Freelancer: Armageddon.&quot;
<br />
<br />I decided to do a sequel to that story because I thought it would be interesting to do a story with Trent being dead, but still including the original characters. I've decided to make Michael King the focus of the story, as I feel he is a character with a lot of storytelling potential.
<br />
<br />I hope you'll forgive me for not coming up with a completely original idea, but this is a concept I've been thinking about for some time. I hope you enjoy the story.
<br />
<br />
<br />---&quot;Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast.&quot;

			<div class="content">To start it off, here is the Prologue.
<br />
<br />PROLOGUE
<br />
<br />	The two men sat quietly, keeping themselves distant from the rest of the patrons in the bar. This way it would be easier to listen to the voices from beyond.
<br />
<br />	Blix and Jonner were a strange pair. They were a frequent sight at the bars on New Berlin, offering their bizarre array of services to the patrons. Most of the New Berliners regarded them as &quot;fortune-tellers,&quot; eccentric but harmless and always good for a show. Blix, a small blond-haired man, never spoke a word, instead channeling his thouhgts via telepathy to Jonner, who would act as his voice. The duo had made quite a name for themselves offering &quot;readings&quot; and opportunities to &quot;contact the dearly departed.&quot; It was a good ruse, all in all.
<br />
<br />	Blix posessed a strange artifact, undoubtedly alien in origin, that enhanced his natural telepatic abilities in such a way as to allow him to see and hear things beyond the natural world. It was a vast array of information he had access to, and there were a few who were willing to pay handsomely for the duo's strange services.
<br />
<br />	Jonner sat quietly across from Blix, watching the smaller blond-haired man as he sat in his trance, the large purple crystal of the artifact glowing feebly and casting an eerie glow around the booth. Blix was in one of his &quot;resting trances,&quot; relaxing completely and letting the myriad alien voices wash over his mind. He could sense nearly every emotion in the alien music: Happiness, anger, even regret. It was an interesting sensation. 
<br />
<br />	Suddenly Blix's eyes opened, and a look of fear came over his face. He began to tremble and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Jonner began to stand up, but as quickly as it had come, the fit had passed, and Blix relaxed. He looked at Jonner, and relayed the strange cryptic message he had heard in his trance from a vaguely familiar voice that was definitely not alien:
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion...find Orillion!&quot;
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">And now, fresh out of the oven, I give you Chapter the First.
<br />
<br />Chapter 1
<br />
<br />	LSF Commander Michael King sat with his feet on his desk, staring blankly into space. He was bored.
<br />
<br />	Ever since the end of the Dom'Kavash invasion two years ago, there had been little for the LSF to do. The colonies were enjoying a time of peace and prosperity that no one had thought possible. Even the criminal organizations, with a few exceptions, were seen less and less, and when they did show up, the local house police forces were ususally sufficent to handle them. As a result, the LSF had mostly been reduced to desk jobs, helping out occastionally with difficult cases that still sprung up every now and then.
<br />
<br />	King had been promoted to Director of LSF Operations for Manhattan, following in the footsteps of his friend Jun'ko Zane, who had resigned the post after the Dom'Kavash invasion had been thwarted. It was during that battle that their good friend Edison Trent had perished in the line of duty. Juni had taken Trent's death very hard, and she resigned from the LSF shortly thereafter. King had heard she was working for the Kusari State Police, but didn't know for sure. He had not seen or spoken to her in two years.
<br />
<br />	King cursed, picked up a dart that had been sitting on his desk and threw it at a dartboard mounted on the opposite wall. There was a picture of an old girlfriend taped to it, although King couldn't remember which one or even why he had put the picture there in the first place. He really wished he cound be out flying again, picking off Liberty Rogues and Xenos, even flying missions for the Order, his &quot;other&quot; employer.
<br />
<br />	Little did he know just how true his wish would become.
<br />
<br />	-----------------
<br />
<br />	King was studying the latest report on Junker activity in Manhattan. Normally the Junkers were harmless, spending most of their time salvaging scrap out of the debris fields, but as of late they had started to raid the trade lanes, which was an unusual move for them.
<br />
<br />	The alert on his comm system chirped, and King answered the call. It was the administrative assistant for his branch of the LSF.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Commander King, I have an incoming priority message on the secure channel for you. It's President Jacobi.&quot;
<br />
<br />	President Jacobi? &quot;Go ahead and put her through.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The image of President Jacobi appeared on the screen. She was an attractive dark-haired woman in her mid 30's, and despite the stress of dealing with Nomad and Dom'Kavash invasions, and the general hassle of running an entire House, she still looked great. King had always harbored a secret crush on her, which annoyed him greatly. &quot;Crushes are for schoolgirls,&quot; he thought to himself regularly.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hello, Madam President. How are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm fine, Commander. How are things in the LSF?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Other than the fact my ass is growing roots into my chair, things are fine.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Jacobi chuckled. King had always been a smartass. It was part of his charm. &quot;Very nice. Now to business. I think we may have a problem here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I have a question for you, first of all. Has Orillion contacted you recently?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, he has,&quot; King replied. &quot;Last week he requested patrol route and fleet strength information for Liberty. I forwarded it to him. Why do you ask?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Jacobi was silent, and King could see that Jacobi was clearly disturbed by this revelation. Finally she spoke.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion never cleared that with me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	King winced involuntarily. &quot;I'm sorry, Madam President. I just assumed he cleared it with you like he normally does.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's all right, Commander, you're not to blame. I just find that disturbing. It's not like Orillion to do something like that. He's always consulted me beforehand before making such requests. I hope it's nothing, but I fear that something may be amiss.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So what do we do?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Commander, I don't want to put you in a difficult spot, as you are his friend, but I must ask you to report to me any requests of that nature that Orillion makes in the future. See if you can find out why he is making these requests. As much as I respect Orillion, I cannot give him access to confidential information without knowing why.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I understand, Madam President. Anything else I can do?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hope and pray that this is nothing. Take care, Commander.&quot; Jacobi's image faded.
<br />
<br />	King sat back in his chair and put his hands behind his head. What was going on? he wondered.
<br />

			<div class="content">Sorry about the long wait, but here is Chapter Two.
<br />
<br />Chapter 2
<br />
<br />	Jun'ko Zane flew her Hawk through the dust cloud that made up nearly all of the Chugoku system, weaving her ship nimbly through the asteroids. It was out here, surprisingly, that she felt the most at ease.
<br />
<br />	Much had happened since the final battle with the Dom'Kavash and the Nomads nearly two years ago. In the days following the battle and the funeral of Edison Trent she had grown increasingly melancholy and depressed. She had lost, in the space of three years, many close friends, and nearly all of them had been related to the Order in some way. She decided that if she remained with the Order she would lose many more friends, and that was something she did not want to live with any longer. She resigned her commission as an Order officer, which Orillion had reluctantly accepted, and returned to the LSF, where she was named chief of Manhattan operations.
<br />
<br />	Juni had been back with the LSF for two months when she had abruptly resigned, stating she had found a new opportunity that she wanted to pursue. In reality, Jun'ko Zane wanted nothing other than to leave Libery forever. The memories of those who she had known and loved were too much to handle, and staying in Liberty wasn't helping matters, so she decided to go to Kusari and begin a new life.
<br />
<br />	It was in Kusari that she found her way back to the Blood Dragons. She had been fying a freelance mission for the Kusari Police when she had come across a patrol of Blood Dragons. Juni had flown with the wingleader several times during her first stay on Kyoto during the First Nomad Invasion and was surprised that the Blood Dragons remembered her. She accepted an invitation to accompany them back to Kyoto, and upon her arrival decided to make Kyoto her permanent home.
<br />
<br />	She flew occasionally with the Blood Dragons, who had renewed an old feud with the Hogosha, but spent most of her time tutoring new Blood Dragon pilots and cruising through the asteroids that littered the Chugoku system. It was a rather good life, but Juni couldn't help but wonder if something was missing from her life.
<br />
<br />	-------------------
<br />
<br />	&quot;Kyoto, this is Dragon Fuji One-dash-Four, requesting landing clearance.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Roger, you're clear on dock two. Welcome back, Ms. Zane.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Thanks, Kyoto.&quot; Juni eased her Hawk into the dock opening and set the ship down on the landing pad. She powered down the ship's systems and climbed out of the cockpit. Juni sighed as she looked around the vast hollowed-out asteroid at the civilization the Blood dragons had created for themselves.
<br />
<br />	She turned and walked toward the Kyoto bar and saw a figure walking toward her from the shadows. As the figure stepped into the light, Juni's jaw dropped.
<br />
<br />	Lord Hakkera was, even at his age, an imposing figure. He was taller than the average Kusari citizen, and his piercing eyes were enough to make even the most hardened Corsair back down.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hello, Jun'ko.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hakkera? What are you doing here?&quot; Juni said when she had regained her ability to speak.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I am afraid there is something we must discuss. Please, let me buy you a drink, and we can discuss things.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Hakkera and Juni sat down in an isolated booth. Hakkera looked around, then looked at Juni with those hard, piercing eyes.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Jun'ko, have you spoken with Orillion lately?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, I haven't spoken or even seen him since I resigned my commission. Why?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Hakkera was silent for a moment. &quot;I'm afraid I must tell you that I am in hiding. My title and authority has been stripped from me. It is because of Casper Orillion.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What?&quot; Juni said in surprise.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Something has happened to Orillion, Jun'ko. He is not the same man that we once knew. He has changed somehow. At first I wondered if somehow he had been affected by the Nomads, but I knew that ths could not be the case, as he did not seem to be affected by the raw cardamine we had been using to create our anti-Nomad weapons. 
<br />	
<br />	&quot;I confronted him some time ago, and he became angry, angrier than I had ever seen him. He ordered me back to Kusari and said he would handle things himself. I had no idea what he meant, but shortly after my return to Kusari I was visited at my home by several agents from the Kusari military, who had orders to arrest me. Fortunately, I was, shall we say, rescued by several of our Blood Dragon friends as they escorted me to New Tokyo. I have been in hiding ever since, moving from one safe house to another, until I was able to make my way here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;But how do you know it was Orillion?&quot; Juni asked, shocked at what she had just heard.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Just before my arrest, I received a neural net message. It simply said, &quot;Your time is over.&quot; It was signed by Orillion.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Could it have been faked?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Possibly, but I have no way to prove that. I must assume the worst, and that is that Orillion considers me a threat, but for what reason I do not know.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Lord Hakkera, this is insane. What could you have possibly done? You've been nothing if not loyal to the Order for who knows how long!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I know, Jun'ko. I don't have any answers.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Juni sat back and pondered all of what she had heard.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So what happens now?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I have contacted Von Claussen, and he has noticed the same strange change in Orillion as well. He is on my side. I must ask you, Jun'ko, if you will help me do what I must do.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Juni thought this over. On one hand, she did not want to get involved in this mess all over again. On the other hand, Hakkera was a good friend and Juni felt a strong sense of loyalty to him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right, I'm with you. What do we have to do?&quot;
