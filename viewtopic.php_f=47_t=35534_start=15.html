			<div class="content">New chapters, finally!
<br />
<br />        <b>Chapter Five
<br />	Near Planet Houston, Texas System  </b>
<br />
<br />	The Flamechaser glided silently through space.  Planet Houston was near.  Jack knew that he owed his life to this stranger, so he figured that he at least ought to let the man take him to where he was heading before he started asking questions.  Jack knew that he was very lucky to be alive.  Moments after they had left the station, it had been destroyed by the large ship.  They had narrowly escaped.  The attackers hadn't noticed them at all, so they had managed to slip away. 
<br /> 
<br />	Jack looked into the viewport.  A large planet was coming up.  It was a tan color, and Jack didn't exactly like the look of it.  He watched as they drew closer and closer to it.
<br />
<br />	After entering the atmosphere, the man guided the ship down towards the planet's surface.  Jack watched as tall buildings and huge factories came into view.  Hundreds of ships, of all sizes, were flying between, over, and around the buildings.  The scale was enormous!  Whoever had created this was a highly advanced civilization, with much technology at their disposal.  The only problem with it was that the sky was so polluted that it was a brown color now.  It gave the whole planet a slimy look to it.  The man guided the ship down into a particularly slimy area, and set it down on a landing pad in a back alley.  The alley didn't exactly seem like a place Jack wanted to be, but if he wanted answers, he would have to follow the man.  The man exited the ship, and Jack followed, like a shadow.
<br />  
<br />	He walked into a small door near the pad, where he was faced with several doors.  He went up to the farthest one on the right, and pulled a key from his pocket.  He slid the key into the lock, and opened the door.  Jack and the man both went inside. 
<br /> 
<br />	Inside, there was a small table, a bed, and a holoscreen on one wall.  It was very simple, with no decorations.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Please, have a seat,&quot; the man gestured to Jack.
<br />
<br />	Jack sat in one of the two chairs at the table.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Before you start asking questions, I want to introduce myself.  I am Matt.  Now, let me explain, because I know where you are from, and I can guess what happened.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;My name is Jack, by the way, and I seriously doubt that, sir.&quot; Jack replied, sure of himself.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, let me tell you what I think happened.  You are a human from Earth.  This ship, the Flamechaser, crashed there, and you just had to go into it and see what it was.  For some reason, the ship launched, and you were in it, and you somehow followed its course back to Sirius, and then Madison Base.  I am correct, right?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wow.  You are pretty close, but, more importantly, how do you know?  And what is Sirius?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I know because the same thing mostly happened to me.  I am from Earth too, Jack, and I did mostly the same thing that you did.  I am still a relative newcomer to this place, I arrived about three months ago.  This place is Sirius.  It is a whole sector.  You will learn more soon.  Now, here is what I want you to do.  I will go give you a book of information on this place.  You read it, while I pack up my things.  Okay?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Fine with me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Matt went to get the book, which turned out to be a datapad that had a file on it for Jack to read.  Jack laid on the uncomfortable bed, while he read and read.  In an hour, he read about the entire history of the people of Sirius, their culture, the four Great Houses, all of the known factions, ships, equipment, goods, other people, stations, bars, nebulas, minefields, radiation, stars, and other things.  None of the items went into much detail, and there was no particular order, which seemed to mean that it had been hastily compiled, most likely for Matt's own use.  Despite that, Jack learned a lot about where he was in that hour, and he felt he understood most of it.  It was still hard to grasp, though, because of the shock of this new world.  He was going to ask Matt to take him back to Earth, but changed his mind.  He had wanted adventure, and here was a golden opportunity.  He had his answers, now he needed to know how to use them.

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter Six    
<br />	Planet Houston, Texas System  </b>
<br />
<br />	Jack followed Matt out to the ship.  They entered, and Matt walked into one of the open bedrooms.  It had many of his personal belongings there, and Matt said that the rest were in the cargo hold.  Jack offered Matt the datapad, but Matt told him to keep it.  He could use it as a reference.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Where are we going, Matt?&quot; Jack asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Houston Spaceport.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What are we doing there?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I put out an ad on the job board system a few hours ago.  We need to hire some freelancers.  Then, the Chaser will be ready to do whatever we need it to, with a full crew.  I also want to sell the fuel and the metals in the back.  We could use the money, for the freelancers will use up the few credits I have left.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Okay, sound good.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good, get inside, and take the co-pilot seat.  We will leave momentarily.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Matt went back inside to close things up, and Jack went to the cockpit.  Moments later, Matt came in and took the pilot seat.  The ship took off, and soared over the skyscrapers, towards the spaceport.
<br />
<br />	When they got close, Jack could see the spaceport.  It was a large, rounded dome, and a large hole in the center was constantly filled with ships flying into and out of the port.  The dome was absolutely huge, over ten miles wide, and was a marvel of engineering.  Windows covered much of the outside of the dome, and there was a variety of doors and walkways leading from the spaceport to either the ground below, or one of the nearby buildings.
<br />  
<br />	The Flamechaser moved into the spaceport, and a voice came over the comm.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Ship #256434, state your destination, please.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;This is ship #256434, we are heading to the freelancer sector.&quot; Matt replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Roger, 256434.  Proceed.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The ship moved down, and came to a specific aisle of landing pads.  A lighted sign said: <i>Freelancer Sector </i>.  Matt guided the ship down onto the first available pad he saw.  The engines stopped, and Matt got up from his seat, and went out onto the pad.  Jack followed, remembering his last experience like this very well.  Matt was going towards the bar, and Jack jogged to catch up with him.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;We are meeting all the interested freelancers in this sector's bar,&quot;  Matt said.
<br />
<br />	He reached a door, and it opened for them.  They walked into a long, tall, bright hallway.  Several groups of people were walking along the hall, but none were close by.  Matt took a right, and the two of them walked down the hall a ways.
<br />  
<br />	Finally, they reached a large door on the left, and a sign that indicated that this was the Freelancer Sector Bar.  Matt pushed the door open, revealing a small bar, with various booths lining the walls and middle of the room.  The bar was along one bar, with a bartender, a thin man in a tuxedo, behind it.  No one else was currently in the bar.  Matt walked up, and told the bartender to direct all people looking for his job to their table.  The bartender smiled and nodded.  Matt found a sizable booth, large enough for six, in the corner, and sat down.  Jack followed suit.  They patiently waited for a time, and then two people walked into the bar.  They immediately went up to the bartender, and he motioned towards Matt and Jack.  The two people, one a woman, one a man, walked towards them.  Matt moved over, and motioned for them to sit down.
<br />  
<br />	The woman was the first to speak.  &quot;You have a job for us?&quot;  She was tall, thin, and good-looking.  She wore loose clothes, and looked like she knew her business.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Yes, you are interested?&quot;
<br />
<br />	It was now the man's turn to speak.  &quot;That's why we're here.  We can always use credits.  Start talking.&quot;  The man was shorter, with a full head of black hair.  While the woman looked rather American or British, the man looked German, and he seemed tough, but kind at the same time, an interesting personality mix.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have a ship, and we need a gunner and engineer for it.  They need to be skilled in those positions, as well as skilled with small arms, as well.  Other skills are helpful, but not worth extra.  I will pay you one hundred down, and fifty per week.  Not to mention, we will be acting as a privateer, so you can expect individual rewards as well.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What kind of ship are we talking?&quot; the woman asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have a Rhino, but it is well-outfitted, and will serve us well.  I also plan on giving it upgrades before we leave.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sounds like a good deal.  We're in.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good, you may get your possessions, and meet us at pad F34 at 1400 hours.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We'll see you there,&quot; said the man.
<br />
<br />	After they had left, Matt went up to the bartender and ordered a drink.  Jack watched as the bartender gathered together a bunch of strange looking ingredients, and mixed them in a bluish liquid.  The bartender handed Matt the drink, and Matt slapped a few credits onto the bar.  The tender scooped them up, and put them in a drawer under the bar.  Matt came back to the table.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What's that?&quot; Jack asked, referring to the drink.
<br />
<br />	&quot;A California Calypso, my favorite drink.  Wanna try it?&quot; Matt asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm not sure, is it legal?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The drinking age here is thirteen.  I know, I had trouble getting used to it at first too.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Jack thought for a second.
<br />
<br />	&quot;How old are you, Matt?&quot; he asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I am twenty-three.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Then exactly how long have you been here in Sirius?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It has been about six years now.  Yep, I've been here since I was seventeen.&quot; Matt replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wow, what did you do in those six years?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, that's a long story.  I basically freelanced, and I had worked my way up to the point that I had a good ship, and I was known, although not well, throughout all four Great Houses.  Then, I was ambushed near Madison a few weeks ago by a group of bloodthirsty pirates called the Outcasts, who wanted my blood because LPI had hired me to kill one of their best pilots.  Man, that was one hell of a mission.  Anyway, they overwhelmed me near Madison, and shot the hell out of my ship.  I ejected at the last possible second, and they left, thinking I was dead.  A group of Liberty Rogues, allies of the Outcasts, picked me up, without knowing about my record with the Outcasts, and took me to their new base in the area, Madison.  I was let free in the base, where I used my last few credits to get a room and food.  I was almost out of the credits in my pocket when you showed up.  Fortunately, I had several hundred credits in my apartment on Texas, so I have enough now to pay for these freelancers.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Didn't you have any friends you could ask, instead of having to pay people?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, everyone thinks I'm dead, and that's a good thing.  The Outcasts will have included my name in the monthly list that they leave for the Police.  A list of people they have confirmed killing.  They do as a matter of pride, so everyone knows who they've killed.  So, now I am technically dead, and I hope to create an alternate identity, so I can travel freely, without old enemies chasing me.  Basically, I am starting fresh, with a clean slate, something many people don't have the ability to do.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Jack nodded, satisfied.  He took a long sip of the drink, and thought that it tasted very good.  It had a cool, refreshing taste, and tasted little like what he had expected.  
<br />	
<br />	Thirty minutes later, Matt and Jack went up to the screen at the landing pad.  Jack watched as Matt had the computer system call the commodity dealer to their pad.  A moment later, a man came out of the door that led to the big hallway.
<br />  
<br />	He was middle-aged, and his hair was starting to gray around the edges.  He walked up to Matt and Jack.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What can I do for you two gentlemen?&quot; asked the man.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have some commodities to sell,&quot; replied Matt.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What do you have to offer?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Thirty units of H-fuel, and forty units of niobium.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Excellent.  According to the current Houston Market prices, we offer you 950 credits for the whole package.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sounds good.  We accept,&quot; said Matt.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You are lucky, sir.  The Market has been showing a lack of those commodities lately.  You have gotten a good price.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I am glad.  Can we do the exchange immediately?  We need to leave.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Of course.  I will summon a pair of lifters to get rid of it, and then I will transfer the credits to your account.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Can I get hard cash for this?&quot; Matt asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;If that is what you prefer, then yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The dealer pressed a few buttons on the datapad he held, and two robots came out of the hallway door.  Jack was initially scared, but Matt gave him a look that told him that it was okay, that the robots were normal.  Jack relaxed, but was still partially uncomfortable.
<br />  
<br />	The robots moved towards the cargo hold, which caused Matt to run into the ship, and the cargo hold door opened.  Matt came out of the ship.
<br />  
<br />	The robots went up the ramp that was formed by the door opening downwards.  They rolled on wheels, and other than that, were humanoid shaped.  They had claws that seemed very strong, which made sense, if their purpose was to lift and haul cargo.
<br />  
<br />	Moments later, the robots came out of the hold, each holding several of the crates.  They went back into the hall, and returned a minute after.  The process continued through several cycles, until all the cargo was unloaded, at which point the robots simply didn't return from the hallway.
<br />
<br />	The dealer produced a chunk of credits from his pocket, and quickly counted through it, with the skill of a practiced businessman, or an experienced card dealer.  He held out a pile of credits.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;950 credits, sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Matt rifled through the pile.  When he was satisfied, he nodded and thanked the dealer, and both men went their separate ways, the dealer back to the hall, and Matt to the ship.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Satisfied?&quot; Jack asked Matt.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah, we got a smoking deal, even for this junky planet.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What time is it?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;1355 hours, our new friends should be here any minute.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Are we going to wait in the ship?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, I want to see them coming.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Five minutes later, the pair of freelancers came out the hallway door.  Right on time.  Matt walked up to them, and greeted them.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;My name is Matt Robinson, and you are?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm Regina Staffords,&quot; the British, or Bretonian, woman said, &quot;But you can call me Reggie.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I am Mike Gotenburg,&quot; the German, or Rheinlandic, man said.
<br />  
<br />	&quot;Good, is the ship satisfying?&quot; asked Matt.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, considering the fact that we?re dirt poor, and have no ships,&quot; said Mike.
<br />
<br />	Reggie agreed.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good, shall we board?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Matt entered the ship, and the other three followed him.  Matt gave a quick tour of the ship, not before Jack removed the body of the ship's former owner from the one room, and took it to the hold.  They didn't want the freelancers to start guessing where they had gotten the ship.
<br />
<br />	The Flamechaser lifted gently off the pad, with Matt as the pilot, Jack as captain, Reggie as engineer, and Mike as gunner.  Matt, Jack, and Reggie were in the cockpit.  Mike was up in the gunner's loft, which was a small room, accessed by a ladder in the cockpit, that had consoles that controlled the guns, as well as a variety of small windows and screens. That enabled Mike to get a good view of what was around the ship.
<br />  
<br />	Jack was very excited, because Matt had appointed him the captain of the ship.  He would assess the current situation, and make decisions.  Matt would help him along, but Jack knew that Matt would be making most of the important decisions; Jack would mostly serve as a navigator, because he was given the job of deciding the course and destination of the ship.  Even though he knew he wouldn?t be doing much, he liked having the job.  It made him feel powerful.
<br />
<br />	The ship left the spaceport, and soared off into the Houston sky.  They exited the atmosphere via a docking ring, and headed for the New York system.
