			<div class="content">Sorry, I thought everybody lost interest <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />121-140:
<br />
<br />If I come into possession of an artifact which can only be used by the pure of heart, I will not attempt to use it regardless. 
<br />
<br />The gun turrets on my fortress will not rotate enough so that they may direct fire inward or at each other. 
<br />
<br />If I decide to hold a contest of skill open to the general public, contestants will be required to remove their hooded cloaks and shave their beards before entering. 
<br />
<br />Prior to kidnapping an older male scientist and forcing him to work for me, I will investigate his offspring and make sure that he has neither a beautiful but naive daughter who is willing to risk anything to get him back, nor an estranged son who works in the same field but had a falling-out with his father many years ago. 
<br />
<br />Should I actually decide to kill the hero in an elaborate escape-proof deathtrap room (water filling up, sand pouring down, walls converging, etc.) I will not leave him alone five-to-ten minutes prior to &quot;imminent&quot; death, but will instead (finding a vantage point or monitoring camera) stick around and enjoy watching my adversary's demise. 
<br />
<br />Rather than having only one secret escape pod, which the hero can easily spot and follow, I'll simultaneously launch a few dozen decoys to throw him off track. 
<br />
<br />Prison guards will have their own cantina featuring a wide variety of tasty treats that will deliver snacks to the guards while on duty. The guards will also be informed that accepting food or drink from any other source will result in execution. 
<br />
<br />I will not employ robots as agents of destruction if there is any possible way that they can be re-programmed or if their battery packs are externally mounted and easily removable. 
<br />
<br />Despite the delicious irony, I will not force two heroes to fight each other in the arena. 
<br />
<br />All members of my Legions of Terror will have professionally tailored uniforms. If the hero knocks a soldier unconscious and steals the uniform, the poor fit will give him away. 
<br />
<br />I will never place the key to a cell just out of a prisoner's reach. 
<br />
<br />Before appointing someone as my trusted lieutenant, I will conduct a thorough background investigation and security clearance. 
<br />
<br />If I find my beautiful consort with access to my fortress has been associating with the hero, I'll have her executed. It's regrettable, but new consorts are easier to get than new fortresses and maybe the next one will pay attention at the orientation meeting. 
<br />
<br />If I am escaping in a large truck and the hero is pursuing me in a small Italian sports car, I will not wait for the hero to pull up along side of me and try to force him off the road as he attempts to climb aboard. Instead I will slam on the brakes when he's directly behind me. (A rudimentary knowledge of physics can prove quite useful.) 
<br />
<br />My doomsday machine will have a highly-advanced technological device called a capacitor in case someone inconveniently pulls the plug at the last second. (If I have access to REALLY advanced technology, I will include a back-up device known as a battery.) 
<br />
<br />If I build a bomb, I will simply remember which wire to cut if it has to be deactivated and make every wire red. 
<br />
<br />Before spending available funds on giant gargoyles, gothic arches, or other cosmetically intimidating pieces of architecture, I will see if there are any valid military expenditures that could use the extra budget. 
<br />
<br />The passageways to and within my domain will be well-lit with fluorescent lighting. Regrettably, the spooky atmosphere will be lost, but my security patrols will be more effective. 
<br />
<br />If I'm sitting in my camp, hear a twig snap, start to investigate, then encounter a small woodland creature, I will send out some scouts anyway just to be on the safe side. (If they disappear into the foliage, I will not send out another patrol; I will break out the napalm.) 
<br />
<br />I will instruct my guards when checking a cell that appears empty to look for the chamber pot. If the chamber pot is still there, then the prisoner has escaped and they may enter and search for clues. If the chamber pot is not there, then either the prisoner is perched above the lintel waiting to strike them with it or else he decided to take it as a souvenir (in which case he is obviously deeply disturbed and poses no threat). Either way, there's no point in entering.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p92378" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">141-160:
<br />
<br />As an alternative to not having children, I will have lots of children. My sons will be too busy jockeying for position to ever be a real threat, and the daughters will all sabotage each other's attempts to win the hero. 
<br />
<br />If I have children and subsequently grandchildren, I will keep my three-year-old granddaughter near me at all times. When the hero enters to kill me, I will ask him to first explain to her why it is necessary to kill her beloved grandpa. When the hero launches into an explanation of morality way over her head, that will be her cue to pull the lever and send him into the pit of crocodiles. After all, small children like crocodiles almost as much as Evil Overlords and it's important to spend quality time with the grandkids. 
<br />
<br />If one of my daughters actually manages to win the hero and openly defies me, I will congratulate her on her choice, declare a national holiday to celebrate the wedding, and proclaim the hero my heir. This will probably be enough to break up the relationship. If not, at least I am assured that no hero will attack my Legions of Terror when they are holding a parade in his honor. 
<br />
<br />I will order my guards to stand in a line when they shoot at the hero so he cannot duck and have them accidentally shoot each other. Also, I will order some to aim above, below, and to the sides so he cannot jump out of the way. 
<br />
<br />My dungeon cell decor will not feature exposed pipes. While they add to the gloomy atmosphere, they are good conductors of vibrations and a lot of prisoners know Morse code. 
<br />
<br />If my surveillance reports any un-manned or seemingly innocent ships found where they are not supposed to be, they will be immediately vaporized instead of brought in for salvage. 
<br />
<br />I will classify my lieutenants in three categories: untrusted, trusted, and completely trusted. Promotion to the third category will be awarded posthumously. 
<br />
<br />Before ridiculing my enemies for wasting time on a device to stop me that couldn't possibly work, I will first acquire a copy of the schematics and make sure that in fact it couldn't possibly work. 
<br />
<br />Ropes supporting various fixtures will not be tied next to open windows or staircases, and chandeliers will be hung way at the top of the ceiling. 
<br />
<br />I will provide funding and research to develop tactical and strategic weapons covering a full range of needs so my choices are not limited to &quot;hand to hand combat with swords&quot; and &quot;blow up the planet&quot;. 
<br />
<br />I will not set myself up as a god. That perilous position is reserved for my trusted lieutenant. 
<br />
<br />I will instruct my fashion designer that when it comes to accessorizing, second-chance body armor goes well with every outfit. 
<br />
<br />My Legions of Terror will be an equal-opportunity employer. Conversely, when it is prophesied that no man can defeat me, I will keep in mind the increasing number of non-traditional gender roles. 
<br />
<br />I will instruct my Legions of Terror in proper search techniques. In particular, if they are searching for escapees and someone shouts, &quot;Quick! They went that way!&quot;, they must first ascertain the identity of this helpful informant before dashing off in hot pursuit. 
<br />
<br />If I know of any heroes in the land, I will not under any circumstance kill their mentors, teachers, and/or best friends. 
<br />
<br />If I have the hero and his party trapped, I will not wait until my Superweapon charges to finish them off if more conventional means are available. 
<br />
<br />Whenever plans are drawn up that include a time-table, I'll post-date the completion 3 days after it's actually scheduled to occur and not worry too much if they get stolen. 
<br />
<br />I will exchange the labels on my folder of top-secret plans and my folder of family recipes. Imagine the hero's surprise when he decodes the stolen plans and finds instructions for Grandma's Potato Salad. 
<br />
<br />If I burst into rebel headquarters and find it deserted except for an odd, blinking device, I will not walk up and investigate; I'll run like hell. 
<br />
<br />Before being accepted into my Legions of Terror, potential recruits will have to pass peripheral vision and hearing tests, and be able to recognize the sound of a pebble thrown to distract them.

			<div class="content">161-180:
<br />
<br />I will occasionally vary my daily routine and not live my life in a rut. For example, I will not always take a swig of wine or ring a giant gong before finishing off my enemy. 
<br />
<br />If I steal something very important to the hero, I will not put it on public display. 
<br />
<br />When planning an expedition, I will choose a route for my forces that does not go through thick, leafy terrain conveniently located near the rebel camp. 
<br />
<br />I will hire one hopelessly stupid and incompetent lieutenant, but make sure that he is full of misinformation when I send him to capture the hero. 
<br />
<br />As an equal-opportunity employer, I will have several hearing-impaired body-guards. That way if I wish to speak confidentially with someone, I'll just turn my back so the guards can't read my lips instead of sending all of them out of the room. 
<br />
<br />If the rebels manage to trick me, I will make a note of what they did so that I do not keep falling for the same trick over and over again. 
<br />
<br />If I am recruiting to find someone to run my computer systems, and my choice is between the brilliant programmer who's head of the world's largest international technology conglomerate and an obnoxious 15-year-old dork who's trying to impress his dream girl, I'll take the brat and let the hero get stuck with the genius. 
<br />
<br />I will plan in advance what to do with each of my enemies if they are captured. That way, I will never have to order someone to be tied up while I decide his fate. 
<br />
<br />If I have massive computer systems, I will take at least as many precautions as a small business and include things such as virus-scans and firewalls. 
<br />
<br />I will be an equal-opportunity despot and make sure that terror and oppression is distributed fairly, not just against one particular group that will form the core of a rebellion. 
<br />
<br />I will not locate a base in a volcano, cave, or any other location where it would be ridiculously easy to bypass security by rapelling down from above. 
<br />
<br />I will allow guards to operate under a flexible work schedule. That way if one is feeling sleepy, he can call for a replacement, punch out, take a nap, and come back refreshed and alert to finish out his shift. 
<br />
<br />Although it would provide amusement, I will not confess to the hero's rival that I was the one who committed the heinous act for which he blames the hero. 
<br />
<br />If I am dangling over a precipice and the hero reaches his hand down to me, I will not attempt to pull him down with me. I will allow him to rescue me, thank him properly, then return to the safety of my fortress and order his execution. 
<br />
<br />I will have my fortress exorcized regularly. Although ghosts in the dungeon provide an appropriate atmosphere, they tend to provide valuable information once placated. 
<br />
<br />I will add indelible dye to the moat. It won't stop anyone from swimming across, but even dim-witted guards should be able to figure out when someone has entered in this fashion. 
<br />
<br />If a scientist with a beautiful and unmarried daughter refuses to work for me, I will not hold her hostage. Instead, I will offer to pay for her future wedding and her children's college tuition. 
<br />
<br />If I have the hero cornered and am about to finish him off and he says &quot;Look out behind you!!&quot; I will not laugh and say &quot;You don't expect me to fall for that old trick, do you?&quot; Instead I will take a step to the side and half turn. That way I can still keep my weapon trained on the hero, I can scan the area behind me, and if anything was heading for me it will now be heading for him. 
<br />
<br />I will not outsource core functions. 
<br />
<br />If I ever build a device to transfer the hero's energy into me, I will make sure it cannot operate in reverse.

			<div class="content">GRAND FINALE: 181-200
<br />
<br />I will decree that all hay be shipped in tightly-packed bales. Any wagonload of loose hay attempting to pass through a checkpoint will be set on fire. 
<br />
<br />I will not hold any sort of public celebration within my castle walls. Any event open to members of the public will be held down the road in the festival pavilion. 
<br />
<br />Before using any device which transfers energy directly into my body, I will install a surge suppressor. 
<br />
<br />I will hire a drama coach. The hero will think it must be a case of mistaken identity when confronted by my Minnesota accent (if everyone sounds American) or my Cornwall accent (if everyone sounds British). 
<br />
<br />If I capture an enemy known for escaping via ingenious and fantastic little gadgets, I will order a full cavity search and confiscate all personal items before throwing him in my dungeon. 
<br />
<br />I will not devise any scheme in which Part A consists of tricking the hero into unwittingly helping me and Part B consists of laughing at him then leaving him to his own devices. 
<br />
<br />I will not hold lavish banquets in the middle of a famine. The good PR among the guests doesn't make up for the bad PR among the masses. 
<br />
<br />I will funnel some of my ill-gotten gains into urban renewal projects. Although slums add a quaint and picturesque quality to any city, they too often contain unexpected allies for heroes. 
<br />
<br />I will never tell the hero &quot;Yes I was the one who did it, but you'll never be able to prove it to that incompetent old fool.&quot; Chances are, that incompetent old fool is standing behind the curtain. 
<br />
<br />If my mad scientist/wizard tells me he has almost perfected my Superweapon but it still needs more testing, I will wait for him to complete the tests. No one ever conquered the world using a beta version. 
<br />
<br />I will not appoint a relative to my staff of advisors. Not only is nepotism the cause of most breakdowns in policy, but it also causes trouble with the EEOC. 
<br />
<br />If I appoint someone as my consort, I will not subsequently inform her that she is being replaced by a younger, more attractive woman. 
<br />
<br />If I am using the hero's girlfriend as a hostage and am holding her at the point of imminent death when confronting the hero, I will focus on her and not him. He won't try anything with his true love held hostage. On the other hand, the fact that she has been weak, slow-witted, naive and generally useless up to this point has no bearing on her actions at the moment of dramatic climax. 
<br />
<br />I will make several ludicrously erroneous maps to secret passages in my fortress and hire travellers to entrust them to aged hermits. 
<br />
<br />I will not use hostages as bait in a trap. Unless you're going to use them for negotiation or as human shields, there's no point in taking them. 
<br />
<br />I will hire an expert marksman to stand by the entrance to my fortress. His job will be to shoot anyone who rides up to challenge me. 
<br />
<br />I will explain to my Legions of Terror that guns are ranged weapons and swords are not. Anyone who attempts to throw a sword at the hero or club him with a gun will be summarily executed. 
<br />
<br />I will remember that any vulnerabilities I have are to be revealed strictly on a need-to-know basis. I will also remember that no one needs to know. 
<br />
<br />I will not make alliances with those more powerful than myself. Such a person would only double-cross me in my moment of glory. I will make alliances with those less powerful than myself. I will then double-cross them in their moment of glory. 
<br />
<br />During times of peace, my Legions of Terror will not be permitted to lie around drinking mead and eating roast boar. Instead they will be required to obey my dietician and my aerobics instructor. 
<br />
<br />Now that you understand my plan, i must kill you all!! 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Whoa, that was exhaustive! The place I got it from only goes until 200. So if anyone finds the sequel, feel free to take over the floor <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
