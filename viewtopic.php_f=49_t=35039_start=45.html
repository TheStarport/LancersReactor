			<div class="content">The movement came slowly, as if in animation. The blade ,red and menacing,  turned loose from it&#8217;s owners hand and began to turn in a small circle arc, inching towards its target, the students neck. He saw with horror what was coming, yet now even he could not move. He watched as the blade neared his neck. It seemed to take minuets, but was over in less than a second. Darth Neo_kuja&#8217;s head lay on the cave floor, the sword, switched off now, lay beside it. He had been defeated and yet, even as the last thought left his head, he wondered how he had lost, then darkness.
<br />
<br />Satisfaction in defeating an enemy filled Darkstone, but, at the same time, emptiness. His anger sated, was of no comfort to him. He knew the may he had just fought and killed. He had studied with him at the academy and not, he lay dead. No satisfaction in that could be found. Perhaps this is what his father was trying to teach him, many years ago. A lesson he had such a hard time with. He and another, a girl that was being trained by his father personally and his Aunt Lea. They were secretive in the training, never with others around. He never understood it and never asked either. He would have to face the girl, to face a member of his family, to stop the Sith. 
<br />
<br />The Death Star prepared to get underway. Reactor power was at full. Thrusters, standing by. The target, Naboo. Home to the Dark Lord&#8217;s family. They had originated there so many years ago with Queen Amidala, the darklord&#8217;s grandmother. This, was where her anger was focused the most. A peaceful and idyllic world. One, that would soon be destroyed in a display of superior technology and firepower equaled to none. All additional fighter craft would remain and defend the shipyards. 
<br />
<br />Indy was in the command center. He had all operations ready for flight control. He keyed the final commands in to begin the trip to Naboo. He was ready to witness the operational fire power of the station. Construction of internal sections continued around the clock. The station resembled the second Death Star in appearance, but was greater in power and size. It was the ultimate destructive force in the galaxy. 
<br />
<br />Lord sycho_warrior was in her chamber. Watching as the stars coalesced in a mass as they jumped to hyperspace. It was a fearsome site for such a structure to be able to travel in hyperspace, but the new shielding made this a reality. She returned to her meditation. She attempted to feel her pupal, but could not sense his energy. She awaken just before a message was relayed to the chamber. It was a transmission from the same source as before. But there was a piece of video attached that was addressed to her, by the name of Carla. That name she had not used or heard used for many years. 
<br />
<br />She keyed up the video sequence, it was images of a sandy cave floor. The recording source, panned around to settle on a body, perhaps the one her disciple was sent to terminate. The camera moved closer and closer to show the body was headless, then a panning to the head. Her anger raged. She fought to strike out at anyone near her. She must focus on her objective now. The image steady now, on the head of Neo_kuja. Failure, failure of the student, of her hand picked disciple. Failure of a sith, at the hands of a Jedi. The image also showed a lit light saber before ending.
<br />
<br />She would seek out and face this threat to her empire and her rule. Then, she would choose a new student to train in the ways of the darkside. She signaled Commander Indy to join her in her chambers. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone had R2 fire up the converters, he had a meeting to attend at the Jedi Counsel. There would still be time to make the time and place of the battle. Tatooine, such a dusty and dismal world, for such an incredible number of encounters between the Jedi and the Sith over the years. Dust swirled and a bantha called out to a mate as Darkstone lifted off the surface. He headed back to Mos Eisley space port. He would tell an old friend what had happened and get him safely away from here and back to Locutus on the Star Princess.
<br />
<br />Han was not all that willing to let Darkstone go after his daughter, but, he was in no position to do anything. He could not fight a sith, nor could he reach his daughter that he never knew. She had not been part of his life, and now, he was about to loose her to her cousin, his nephew. In a battle that would decide the fait of the Galaxy. He could only do as Darkstone asked and headed to meet Locutus and disappear until word was brought as to the fate of either of the two children.

			<div class="content">Han was not all that willing to let Darkstone go after his daughter, but, he was in no position to do anything. He could not fight a sith, nor could he reach his daughter that he never knew. She had not been part of his life, and now, he was about to loose her to her cousin, his nephew. In a battle that would decide the fait of the Galaxy. He could only do as Darkstone asked and headed to meet Locutus and disappear until word was brought as to the fate of either of the two children.
<br />
<br />Darkstone landed on the lone pad. His walk to the Jedi chambers was silent. No one had come to meet him, in spite of sending a message that he was on his way. He had sent the signal of the demise of the dark student to the council as well and now he surmised they were not happy with him. He keyed the entry lock and headed to the turbo lift to the main meeting hall. 
<br />
<br />No one was there when he arrived. Now, he was a little perplexed. He decided to go to his quarters and rest a while. Protocol droids that saw him in the hall, gave him preference, which was unusual. One droid, though, stopped him. &#8220;Master Darkstone, it&#8217;s so good to see you fully functional&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see you again too, 3PO&#8221; Darkstone remarked. Now he was curious. He had left 3PO in the care of Han, but, now he was here, why?
<br />
<br />&#8220;Begging you pardon Sir, but masters Gowserpaul and Gowserchris would like to see you in thier office as soon as possible&#8221; 3PO said. He still hated being a messenger boy, but resigned himself to his lot in life. He turned to follow Darkstone as he headed for the office. He still though of humans as strange creatures, but counted himself lucky to belong to a species that did not find him tasty. 
<br />
<br />The door slid aside as Darkstone approached the chamber. There were several seated in the room as he walked in. Han, Locutus, Esquilax, Wizard, Chips as well. There was a holo graphic player set up as well on a side table. The image was frozen in its motion. A light saber blade, turning to cut off an individuals head. This would be a pointed meeting. 
<br />Naboo, such a beautiful planet. It had remained as it was during the rule of Queen Amidala. Pristine and green. Water flowed, clear and cool over the falls outside of the palace. The current queen, two years in the office, was Wen Shin. She had meany of the features Amidala had and then some. She ruled with a wise head and the planet grew and was extremely prosperous. The Gungans had their own shipping business as well. The son of Jar Jar Binks was the head of the corporation. He did not have his fathers clumsiness, but was wise and sure footed in his dealings.
<br />
<br />The Queen and her ministers were in a closed door meeting over the dreaded news they had received from the Jedi. A Death Star, could easily destroy their world in a second. There was no way to defend themselves from that. It had come down to their resolve to defend themselves by what ever means they could. All of their Naboo fighters would join with the republics fighters that they were sending and with the fleet that was due to arrive latter in the day. They would not simply roll over and die.
<br />
<br />Her ground forces commander, Major Striker, was already formulating an attack plan, if they send troops down first. He would be ready for any type of attack. He coordinated with the Gungan troops that all areas would be covered and any fall back points, if needed, were set up. Nothing would be left to chance.
<br />
<br />The republic fleet, dropping out of Hyper Space, assumed an orbit with the planet ant the position of the Death Star, that would be arriving with in a day. There were eight bulwark battle Cruisers in this fleet as well as several dreadnaughts. Fighter complements were tripled what was at the last battle. The would be poised to give a greater fight this time. They also had an edge as well. An imperial shuttle and a transport were intercepted and brought to this location. In board the transport were two weapons. After interrogating the officer in the shuttle, they now knew these were ultimate weapons that were originally intended to be used on planetary worlds. 
<br />
<br />The officer, freighter fighter, gave them much information as to the capabilities of the weapons. They could in fact, cloak, making the deadly on delivery as the target would never see them coming. It was arranged that a &#8220;slip&#8221; in communications would be sent out once the death Star had arrived. It was hoped the knowledge of having these weapons, would literally send the death Star packing and leave the Imperial fleet alone, to be destroyed. But, time would tell if it would be believed. 
<br />
<br />Admiral Bargib and Commander Spix were conferring over the current situation. The both decided it would be a good idea to have the fighter support in space when the fleet dropped out of hyper space. That way, they could engage the enemy fighters quickly, taking an element of surprise. Arania would head up the assault wings and relay all orders to the wings as needed. Bargib was still doubtful of success of this battle. A lot hinged on the bluff they had to pull off. The Death Star would still have to be dealt with, but, this battle was a diversion as well. A smaller, more powerful fleet was headed to Yavin and the shipyards. They had to destroy it at all costs.
