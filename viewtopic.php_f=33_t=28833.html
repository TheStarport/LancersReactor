			<div class="content">Hello, I'm a great fan of the Rebalance Mod and have enjoyed playing it for some time now.  However, there are two things that I would really REALLY like to see in the next version:
<br />
<br />1.) I have always been hoping that someone would, in a mod, restore the Rogue base which is destroyed at the beginning of the SP game.  I just think that a pirate base which you could dock at inside that air bubble in the particle field (inside the Pittsburg debris field) would be really cool.  Though Rochester may be strategically located if you are preying on the tradelanes around Fort Bush and Manhattan, a Pirate base in that Pittsburg particle field would be extremely useful to pirate beginners as it would be near the almost entirely Boron freight line between Pittsburg and Baltimore, and would offer... hidden in that bubble in the particle field... a very real sense of being part of the pirate underground.  
<br />
<br />2.) The Mule is a funny ship for the Xenos to be flying... as they are former aegira employees and enemies of most Liberty pirate factions... so, how would they get it?  Could you maybe give them the starblazer or some other enhanced but civil looking ship instead?  Maybe a souped up Rhino could do the trick?  Also, so as to not make it (the Rhino) too common, why not give the Junkers something like that freighter sold on Newark instead?.. or, possibly even a more rusty coloured heavy lifter?  It doesn't make sense that a mostly scrap collecting organization like the Junkers would have shields on ~all~ their ships.
<br />
<br />Thanks a bunch!
<br />
<br />Eric

			<div class="content">Actually, I think those ships models are pretty cool... well detailed compared to others I have seen.  The problem in servers is that everyone wants to drive a ~hot rod~, which doesn't create the most realistic gameplay experience.  Nobody flies these ships because they're not armed and armoured enough to be competent against anything sold outside of Liberty, and yet they can't carry enough to make long distance trading worthwhile.  Even so, however, they're decent for they're price tags and I, amongst these, am particular fond of the freighter and light fighter (a.k.a., inter-gallactic egg beater) sold on Newark.  I haven't personally bought any of the nifty homeworld ships on Trenton, yet... but they don't seem to be bad either.
<br />
<br />Online, the problem is to find people who actually ~enjoy~ playing the mediocre, anonymous corporate cargo pusher/miner/escort pilot/scrap collecter.  Yet, having a lot of players filling these roles would add alot to the gameplay experience.  The problem is, almost everyone who plays MP wants to think of themselves as the supreme fighter ace of the galaxy... so it is no wonder that player controlled, mid-level ships are few in number.

			<div class="content">Good call Gladius!  
<br />but.. hmm.. people in those average corporate ships are very easy targets for those champion pilots of the universe to prove the brute force of thier ship by randomly choosing such averge and not so ultimate ships as target practice for there state of the art ultimate super duper guns that kill in one hit (i know it always takes 2) just to prove there strength and further fortify there massive egos.  So.. who wants to be a target..?  Who wants to be the champion..?  Ya it makes sence I geuss... lol!  But true that if there were less of that it may actually increase the experience somewhat.. As it is, you cant duel with anyone.  Why?  Because everyone is trying to trade with these cheap routes and get as much money as fast as possible to buy this Leviathen or Sabre or whatever it is that floats there boat.  Then what do we get?  A universe filled with capships and ultimate pilots where no one fights anyone or anything.  At this point they start a new character and do it all over again so they can have more Ultimate characters.  lol!  Sometimes I wish all trading could just be ommited!  But thats only because I long for the battlefield and the thrill of the hunt!  That wouldnt be fair to the common docile attitude of most players who think your ann asshole if you shoot at them.  Sigh.  Have I gotten off subject?  Anyways, hey MD, can you please get rid of that stupid trade from Jupiter base to Earth with light arms.  Thats entirely gay and ruins the point of earning anything.  Nobody earns anything it seems they just fly back and forth for a few hours and VIOLA!  They get a Leviathan for all thier so called hard work!  I mean atleast the trade to New tokyo was more than a 40k trip or even the engine components to mactan took more time and required work to get freindly with them.  But jesus now theres no work involved at all.  And do you think after they get these Leviathans they want to duel eachother? hell no they just wanna go bully liberty till they get bored, then move on to a new character.  It spoils the point of MP cause the only interaction from player to player is to give away some of there massive fortune to look cool to new players which they did not even earn accordingly!  I propose that the ease of trading should be decreased and I hop someone can agree with me here.  Even using EFA as a shortcut for trades makes it extremely easy compared to that in unmodded freelancer.  There must be a way to make people earn money again.. I think people will get bored to quickly if they just spend a few hours doing the same 2 way trade path and then are maxed out.  Just suggestion.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
