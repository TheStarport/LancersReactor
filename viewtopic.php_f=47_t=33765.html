			<div class="content">OK, the sequel to Captured will be ready very soon. Chances are, it will be up tonight. I have finally decided on the name Chaos Theory. No, I didn't get this name from the new <a href='http://www.splintercell3.com' Target=_Blank>Splinter Cell 3: Chaos Theory</a> game from Ubisoft. I would tell you what the title has to do with anything, but that would be spoiling the story. Therefore, all I will say is that the sequel to Captured will be called Chaos Theory.

<br />Chaos Theory Pt. 1: The Night Hunter
<br />
<br />
<br />    It had been nearly five years since the second Nomad and Dom Kavish invasion on Sirius. After Marshal Law had been lifted on Sirius and humanity had gained it's freedom back, Trent and Juni were honored. They were the only two surviving members of the crew that set off on the Freedom and Independence nearly five years ago. When Trent had finally proposed to Juni, he swore everyone on Los Angeles could hear the echoing YES, YES, ES, ES. And so finally, the day of their wedding had come, with Trent in a black tuxedo, and Juni in the most expensive wedding dress money could buy. Juni's mother and father had been invited, and had come all the way from Hokkaido, but unfortunately, Tobias was also there, and was really drunk. After the preacher had pronounced them &quot;Man and Wife&quot; and they kissed, the audience rose and applauded. Tobias was starting to get very drunk, and almost said something that would he knew he would regret. &quot;I like-&quot; Tobias stopped mid-sentence. Trent was glaring at him, and so he took his seat. Every one in the chapel turned and scowled at the man, and a few laughed.
<br />
<br />    After the ceremony was completed, Juni and Trent had decided to start a new life on Toledo. It was quiet there, and there was no one else around except a few guards, and the new leader of the Order, Kress. They had decided to live there because no one would bother them, but unknown to them, their lifetime vacation was about to be rudely interrupted. There had been dozens of reports of people seeing others with glowing blue eyes, and spreading seeds to another. But Trent thought that it was just a bunch of crazy people trying to get attention, although most of the events were explained scientifically, some had no other explanation except that the Nomads were still alive.
<br />
<br />    Late one night, Trent couldn't sleep. He had tried to take sleep aids, but nothing seemed to work. So he went back to bed after watching TV for a couple of hours, and just laid there. Juni was laying asleep beside him, and he didn't want to disturb her, so he quietly got up, went into the kitchen and made him some ice cream. While he was sitting at the table, Trent thought he could see movement out of the corner of his eye. He got up to investigate, but every thing appeared normal. I must be more tired than I thought.  Trent though to himself. After finishing his ice creme, Trent went back into the room and tried to go back to sleep. But after a few seconds, he noticed that the sheets felt wet. He opened his eyes to see the same, unchanged, dark room, where the moonlight entered through the big bay windows, the thought he could see a dark color on the white sheets. Trent rose up, and turned on the lamp. Then he noticed something strange, there was blood all over the sheets. Trent, now getting quite nervous, cocked his head to look at Juni. What he saw almost made him sick to his stomach. Juni was laying there, hardly breathing, with a long, skinny cut down the middle of her throat. He slowly put his head to her chest, and listened. There was a faint heartbeat, but it was very weak. Trent slowly stood up to pull the emergency alarm, but he felt like some one or something was breathing right on his neck. 
<br />
<br />    He spun around just in time to feel a sharp pain in his right shoulder. He looked down, and a knife blade was sticking into his arm. In the shadows, there was a faint blue glow in the shape of two eyes. He felt another pain near his collar bone as he jolted back. &quot;That's twice I have missed your heart Coronal Trent. But I assure you, I will not miss again.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />This is the end of Chaos Theory Pt. 1
<br />Episode 2 should be out tomorrow. I promise that the next chapter will be longer.

			<div class="content">Chaos Theory Pt. 2: Drafted
<br />
<br />
<br />      &quot;Thats twice now that I have missed your heart Colonel Trent. But I assure you, I will not miss again.&quot; The man was clearly infested with a Nomad, the blue eyes gave Trent all of the proof he needed. Trent swung at the man with his left arm, but missed. The man easily dodged all of Trent's swings, practically asking for more. Trent swung with all of his strength, but the man ducked, and kicked him in the stomach as hard as he could. 
<br />     Trent slammed up against the wall, and he felt dizzy, but his vision cleared up just in time to dodge another swing from the man. He tackled Trent and had him on the floor. He pulled out the knife, and pointed it right at Trent's heart. Trent was fighting it with all he had, but the man was just too strong. The blade inched closer to his chest, almost to his Shirt. It was then that Trent noticed exactly where they were, right above him, on a wall rack, were Juni's most prized possessions, ancient Samurai swords. With one arm, the man was easily overpowering Trent, and the knife was now almost to his chest. With all of his might, Trent pushed the knife back and reached for one of the swords. As the man was regaining his balance, Trent had the sword unsheathed, and was ready to fight. Again the man came at him at breakneck speed with the knife. 
<br />   Trent didn't even have time to react, and again, the knife was just about to pierce his chest. Trent kicked the man with all he had, and slashed him in the face with the sword. The man went into shock, his eyes turned to a dull blue color, and a long, slim cut opened on his face. Blood started to drip out, and the man fell, a large puddle of blood now starting to seep onto the floor. &quot;Overhead&quot; Trent said, and the main light came on. It was then that Trent realized just who this man was, it was the new leader of the Order, Kress.
<br />  He thought he was going to be sick, in the past six years, he had lost Enrique, Orillion, King, and now Juni and Kress. He walked over to the bed where Juni lay, still in the position she had gotten into the bed in, with the sheets covered with blood. She was not breathing, but Trent could still hear a very faint heartbeat. Trent rushed over to the alarm and triggered it. About twenty- five seconds later, armed guards rushed into the room, guns drawn. They looked at Kress, at Trent, and then at Juni. They put her in the portable stasis pod and rushed her off to the medical chamber.
<br />  About one hour later, Trent was approached in the waiting room by a strange man. &quot;Col. Trent?&quot; The man asked. Trent looked up and stared at the man, and then shook his head. &quot;I'm the newly appointed leader of the Order.&quot; The man said, extending a hand. Trent ignored his hand and said &quot;Can I help you? If your offering me a job, this really isn't the time.&quot; The man shrugged and said &quot;It's not an offer Mr. Trent, its a draft.&quot; Trent was shocked, and he looked at the man. &quot;I'm afraid that you no longer have a choice in the matter. You are the Order's best pilot, and you will help with this situation, or be imprisoned until this is resolved, IF it is resolved.&quot; The man pointed to Juni in the O.R., and grinned a little. Trent stood up. &quot;Look, I have helped save humanity twice. I'm sure that there is some one in the Order that is better than me, after what happened, I just don't want anything to do with this. What will I get out of it?&quot; This was indeed, a stupid question. The man pulled out a gun &quot;Your life Mr. Trent. I think that is a fair and reasonable reward, don't you?&quot;
<br />
<br />This is the end of Chaos Theory Pt. 2
<br />Pt. 3 will be coming soon.

			<div class="content">Chaos Theory Pt. 3: The Return
<br />
<br />    &quot;Your life Mr. Trent. I think that is a fair and reasonable reward, don't you?&quot; The man pointed his gun at Trent's arm that had been treated for the knife wound, and said &quot;If you don't do this, I will be forced to have you arrested and chances are, if you don't help, humanity will be lost in a matter of days.&quot; The man lowered his gun, and to Trent's surprise, put it back in it's holster. Trent looked in the window of the Operating Room where they were preforming a very difficult, hopefully life saving procedure. &quot;You don't want that to happen to almost every one do you? If you don't help, the human race will become extinct in under a week. So Mr. Tr- Colonel Trent, will you help the Order? Will you help humanity?&quot; Trent closed his eyes and bowed his head, he was apparently praying for Juni's life. He brought his head back up and faced the man. The words on his name tag were <b>Com. Jodeco Blanca  </b>. &quot;OK, I'm in. What do I have to do?&quot; Trent asked, already knowing the answer. Commander Blanca explained that several Nomad Interceptors had been reported in the Sigma cluster and most of the Omega, Tau and Omicron systems.
<br />
<br />   &quot;Well, do I get another Anubis? I really liked that ship. Just please, don't assign me another crap pile like that Raven Claw 6300. That thing was nothing but a flying, metal scrap heap.&quot; For the first time, Com. Blanca smiled a little. &quot;I have something I think you might like even more. Have you ever heard of the El Chupacabra? In English that translates to 'The Goat Eater'&quot; Commander Blanca said with a smile. &quot;That's what you will be flying. It can hold six torpedo launchers, 12 Lv. 10 turrets, 6 Lv. 10 guns, it's shield strength is about 600,000. And it's hull is nearly indestructible. This is by far the best ship mankind has ever built, and its not a freighter, its a VHF.&quot; Trent was shocked. Never in his life had he even dreamed of a ship this powerful, but the Order was just giving him one even stronger, with all of the weapons included, at no charge. He didn't even think that 900 million credits could buy a ship that strong from the Order, but he now had one for free. 
<br />
<br />  Commander Blanca motioned for him to follow, and follow Trent did. When they reached the hangar, Trent was speechless. &quot;This ship is about the size of a Humpback, but with micro thruster technology, it will handle like a Dagger.&quot; This was by far the best ship he had ever seen in his life, and it was his, all his. The doctor came walking into the room, and with a smile on his face said &quot;Jun'ko Zane just needs a little rest now, after that she should be fine. Mr. Trent, I don't think you know just how lucky she was to survive long enough to get into the PSP (portable stasis pod). She lost nearly all of the blood in her body, her main vain in her neck was cut. And I'm sorry about what happened to Commander Kress.&quot; Again Trent bowed his head and shook it. 
<br />
<br />   An alarm sounded, and red lights started flashing all over the place. The intercom boomed &quot;We have very strange readings on our long- range scanners...&quot;there was a short pause. Then &quot;Readings confirmed to be Nomad energy signatures. All fighters, report to the landing bay immediately. All other personnel, prepare for an EVAC of the base ASAP. I repeat, all fighters to the landing bay, all personnel, EVAC ASAP!&quot; Trent rushed to his ship and climbed in. The engines roared to life and lifted the massive ship off the floor and moved it to the launch pad. The ship lifted off the ground and began to reach the top of the atmosphere, were he could see the docking ring already opened. Trent cleared the planetary orbit with several other ships ready to engage the Nomads. As soon as the Nomads saw them, they opened fire, destroying several ships almost instantly. Trent fired 8 torpedoes and all of his main guns at a Nomad Capital ship that had just uncloaked, all hitting it on the top side of it's hull. The ship exploded with it's usual blue flash as Trent focused on a Nomad Interceptor. With the new and powerful guns he had, the ship was gone after three shots, and he focused on another one.
<br />
<br />   Trent loved this ship. Not only did it have a lot of firepower, and Blanca wasn't joking when he said it handled like a Dagger, this thing would turn on a dime. Trent took out five more Interceptors just as three more Nomad Battleships were uncloaking, which didn't surprise Trent in the least. Again he fired his arsenal at the Battleship hitting it directly on it's belly. Yet again the ship exploded and only two of the original four Battleships were still there. The Nomads saw what Trent was doing and broke their attack to fire on Trent.
<br />
<br />   He began dodging wave after wave of Nomad fire, but there was just too much. His shield had already been drained to half- power, and he was almost out of batteries. &quot;Shield Failed.&quot; the computer said in it's usual calm voice, oblivious to the fact that it could be destroyed. Trent's shield was now out, and he was starting to take substantial hull damage. Five Nomad Interceptors flew at him in an intercept course at breakneck speed, firing their torpedoes. Trent flew straight into the torpedoes and was now in the &quot;Critical hull&quot; range as the computer called it. His shield came back on-line, just in time to save him from sure death. The docking ring had been opened on both sides and now transports and freighters were pouring out, helping Trent a little.
<br />
<br />  A voice came over the radio, &quot;Everyone, this is Commander Blanca. Your are ordered to rendezvous with the Osiris. A waypoint has been uploaded into everyones on board computer. I repeat,  rendezvous with the Osiris.&quot; Another Battleship reveled itself and began opening fire on all of the human crafts. &quot;Com. Blanca, another capital ship just uncloaked, we can't leave.&quot; Trent said into the radio, hoping everyone would follow his lead. &quot;Col. Trent, you are to return to the Osiris immediately. That is an order!&quot; Commander Blanca shouted over the radio. But Trent couldn't leave, not as long as there were still people on Toledo, including Juni. He had to stay. He fired another wave of torpedoes and missiles at the most recently arrived battleship, crippling it severely. Trent fired on another one, but it got him first. He was flying right into the Nomad fire, and the words that the computer said sent a chill down his spine. &quot;Shield failed. Hull breach imminent!&quot;

<br />I don't know when the next episode will be up, if it will be today or not. I am pretty sick today, but I will get it up when I get a chance.

<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Shield failed. Hull breach imminent.&quot; The computer said in it's calm voice, not aware of the fact that it was about to be blown to bits. Trent just couldn't believe his luck, after all he had been through, he was going to die like a wimp. Just flying into the Nomad m&#234;l&#233;e, like a rag doll. He just couldn't believe it. His engines had been disabled and he had lost his steering and navigation, but somehow, his ship held together. The Nomads seized their fire, and just left Trent alone for the time being.  This doesn't make any since, why don't they kill me?  Out of his window he could now see why the Nomads had ignored him. It was the Battleship Osiris, drawing all of the Nomad fire. The Osiris cloaked, and then appeared right under Trent. The Nomads fired at both ships, damaging the Osiris and destroying Trent's. But luckily, he had ejected just in time. The Osiris tractored him up, and fired it's thrusters. &quot;All remaining personnel have been cleared from Toledo. Launch the EMP mines. I repeat, launch the EMP mines and hit star drive. I want a course for Juneau Shipyard, Alaska system, Liberty space.&quot; Commander Blanca said over the intercom.
<br />
<br />As Trent was climbing out of the R/EP(rescue/escape pod) and making his way to the bridge. Commander Blanca yelled over the intercom again &quot;I want that EMP launched and the star drive activated. Were going to Alaska.&quot; By this time, Trent had made his way to the bridge and was being stared down by Blanca. &quot;You disobeyed a direct order, Mr. Trent. Consider this your warning. Should it happen again....&quot; Blanca said, flashing his gun. He then picked up the microphone and yelled into the intercom &quot;Why the hell hasn't' that mine been launched yet? We should be half way to Sigma 19 by now. What's Taking so long? The Osiris is taking heavy damage!&quot; Everyone in the room and on the ship could tell that Blanca was not happy at all. The mine was finally launched and the star drive engines were on line, and the Osiris was now on it's way to Alaska.
<br />
<br />As the Osiris entered hyperspace, Trent approached Blanca. &quot; I just need to say that I'm sor-&quot; Blanca held his hand up, telling him that he had already heard enough. Blanca just walked away, and turned down the corridor that led to his quarters.
<br />
<br />After about an hour, Trent decided to visit Juni in the medical bay. The doctor saw him and led him right to Juni's room. She was awake, watching the news reports about the increased encounters with what seemed to be Nomad ships. When Trent walked in, she looked at him and smiled. He walked over to the bed and sat down on the corner and smiled. &quot;Thank you. You saved my life, I would be dead right now if it wasn't for you.&quot; Juni leaned up and kissed him on the cheek. After Trent had told her what he had been through, he found some sheets, a blanket and a pillow. He set up a little bed on the couch and spent the night there, with the woman he loved by her side.
<br />
<br /> While Trent and Juni slept, Blanca was in the Com. Tower. He was trying to get in touch with President Jacobi, at about 3:15 AM SST. Jacobi awoke to a beeping  on her neural net communicator watch, so she flipped it on and a holographic image of Commander Blanca floated above the watch. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Madam Jacobi?&quot; Blanca asked blankly.
<br />She yawned and said &quot;Who are you and how did you get my NN address?&quot;
<br />&quot;Ms. Jacobi, this is Commander Jodeco Blanca of the Order. We have urgent news. We need you on the Osiris.
<br />&quot;What's this all about?&quot; she asked, now starting to sound like her proper, well mannered self. &quot;It isn't them again is it? Where is the Osiris?
<br />&quot;Not over the Com. Channel. We will send one of our pilots to pick you up.&quot;
<br />&quot;How soon do I need to be there?&quot;
<br />&quot;How soon can you be ready?&quot;
<br />&quot;Maybe twenty minutes at the most.&quot;
<br />&quot;Good, our man will be there in fifteen. Blanca out.&quot;
<br />
<br />There was a knock on Juni's door, and Trent got up to get it. The door slid into it's pocket and in stepped Com. Blanca. &quot;You have the chance to redeem yourself Mr. Trent. We need you to go to Manhattan and pick up President Jacobi. The Order will give you another El Chupacabra, and the weapons load-out. So, are you in?&quot; Trent shook his head, still half asleep, not quite sure about what he was agreeing to. &quot;Good, you leave immediately.&quot; Com. Blanca said tossing him his helmet from across the hall.
<br />
<br />Trent was ready after a short time and was walking to the landing bay, accompanied by Juni. As Trent stepped into the elevator that would take him to the landing bay, he could see Juni waving at through the closing glass doors. She blew him a kiss, and he pretended to catch it. He mouthed the words &quot;I love you.&quot; as the elevator dropped down the shaft, watching Juni disappear from his sight.
