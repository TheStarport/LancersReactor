			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p21617" class="post-subject">*FIX* MODS crashing on loadup? FL crashing on Loadup?? Find</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Okay - just a quick one from earlier posts by me, but here poeple also post the same question - so this is just a paste from elsewhere - so it may refer to other poeple <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><b>Having trouble with crashes on startup? Errors in destinations when activating?     </b>
<br />
<br />Okay - follow these <b>SIMPLE    </b> rules, and most poeple will be fixed. This is <b>NOT    </b> a help thread, we won't sort your problems out with finding things or anything else, that is for the <b>maker of the mod to do    </b>, HOWEVER, there are an ALARMING AMOUNT who don't read the readme file for help, OR the mods don't supply it. To get you working quickly - here is the fixes in general*
<br />
<br />1. Please make sure you are using Freelancer Mod Manager Version 1.2 Beta 9 as most mods need this version. It contains instructions that previuos versions do not, and also options and other things. You can find this <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=747' Target=_Blank><b>HERE        </b></a>
<br />
<br />Okay - now install that if you haven't already. Good stuff - you are about 3 steps away from working.
<br />
<br />
<br />Next - your mod won't activate. Their is an error - something is missing. 
<br />This means that thier is a discrepancy between your files and the mods. This can be from a previous mod that didn't deactivate all the way to a space in a file (honest!). Their are two fixes to this problem:
<br />
<br />1)<b> Reinstall FL        </b>. I know - its gonna take 5 mins - is it worth it? Up to you - either play the mod or not <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. So, yep - go to your freelancer gameFolder and DELETE the freelancer folder (default is c:\program files\microsoft games\). Once done, insert the CD and have reinstall.
<br />
<br />2) <b>Use the Freelancer SDK         </b>(not official) which contains all the ini files pre-decompressed by Louva Deus. He has also fixed many basic errors in the files, and although there is no proof it makes the game run smoother or better, personally - I still believe it doesn't harm. this is also the &quot;cheap&quot; mans reinstall - as it gives you clean ini files without reinstalling <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />You can download the SDK  <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=747' Target=_Blank><b>HERE        </b></a>
<br />
<br />Once you download it, it uses an installer. Make sure its going to install to your Freelancer Folder. You need to make sure its path is your DATA folder, but by default its going to write to that anyway - see below picture for what i mean!
<br /><img src='http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/SDK.JPG     '>
<br />
<br />Obviuosly its going to install to data folder, so i don't need to select the data folder at all - otherwise it would make a folder called data inside the data folder! That would be stupid <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay - so now you have a clean game. now activate the mod and it should work!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3. I CRASH WHEN LOADING.
<br />
<br />Okay - this is the most COMMON complaint at the moment. Crashing when loading up - splash screen then desktop. Okay - to fix this problem you need to do a few things for us <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> First - open FLMM and then go to the tools menu - here you will find the &quot;Delete autosave&quot; - click on that and delete it please <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br /><img src='http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/FLMMautosave.JPG     '>
<br />
<br />Next - IN the same bit you will see the &quot;Open Save games folder&quot; - click on that as well. This opens up your save games (of which i have thousands here obviously - shows how often i do this) and then select them all and delete them 
<br />
<br /><img src='http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/savegames.JPG     '>
<br />
<br />The MOVE save games DOESN'T always work! So try this. Then - follow above - install the SDK or reinstall again and give it another go.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay - other problems? Deactivation. IF ANY errors arise - then click on RESTORE backups in the tools part. It may automatically restore backups - but you can try this again. Personally - if something doesn't deactivate properly - i just reinstall the game again. Sometimes files aren't restored and it deletes them instead - this is when you have to reinstall - however, that will have been fixed in the first part <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />There we go - after that - have fun and enjoy. IF you crash whilst playing - try again. If you crash again, then please tell the modder. They cannot fix bugs without information though - so DO NOT BOTHER unless you are going to include:
<br />
<br />Where you were (system)
<br />Location? (at Fort Bush)
<br />Action? (Launching or docking with tradelanes etc).
<br />
<br />These are sooooo necessary. Also include if you were doing a mission, WHOM AGAINST??? there are thousands of reasons for crashes, but that info there narrows it down from looking through a few MILLION charactesr of text down to looking at a file containing only around 40 thousand instead. Trust me - some files have 60,000 lines in them, and a crash can be from something as small as a single spelling mistake - so as much info as possible is needed. Tell them your loadout, your ship, what you had for breakfast - EVERYTHING you can. If you crash on a base, were you launching, which room did you go to? what were you clicking on and other things - as this cuts it down from 8 files to just around 100 lines of text. See how helpful it is?
<br />
<br />There we go folks - stick to this and you should be working <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />*won't fix all, only startup crashes for mods and clean FL games. For other crashes IN game, please email the respective mod makers, or post in THEIR FORUMS which might be below editing forums, or supplied a link inside FLMM to their forums.

<br />
<br />This can be several reasons. Are you playing a mod or not? If not, then try the ABOVE to make sure that your files are clean totally, and then try again.
<br />
<br />If you are, then the chances are that the mod has bad encounters problems outside the base. You might be able to launch about 50% of the time, but sometimes the bad faction encounter is there, and it crashes. Complain to the mod maker about that one.
<br />
<br />If your on <b>MP SERVERS </b> and you get a disconnected message instead, then the chances are that you were booted by the patch, as it detected something. Are you running any mods? Does the server have any mods? If you ran a mod recently, follow the first posts instructions to make sure you have a clean game. After that, it could be that the server crashes whilst you were taking mission object back to base, and that caused the crash (as its still in hold although mission is gone <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> - just jettison it).
<br />
<br />Sometimes, FL just crashes. I once tried in a unmodded system, with NO npcs in it, (i removed them all) and launched and landed repeatedly. I did it about 12 times in IMMEDIATE succession, as i selected the base as soon as i launched and hit dock. ROughly once every ten launches the game crashed. There was NOTHING that could have caused this apart from inherent game instability - so if you were pissing about trying to get new bribes or other such stuff at stations, that could be why <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />For all problems other than this when running mods - CONTACT MOD MAKERS as they need to fix the bugs in their mods to make it worthwhile playing <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> - and suprisingly enough, they cannot do this unless you tell them your problem <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> - they cannot find everything you know <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />If its a clean game, and you have the frames problems, then i have no idea, i am NOT a technical person <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Some other issues that I found when I had the same problem was my video card drivers were goofy.  I removed all traces of the old drivers and installed a good clean set (following all of the instructions in the readme file) and reinstalling the game and DirectX, and all of my problems went away.  Hope it helps!</div>

			<div class="content">I have a problem running Porches Star Wars ship pack in SP.
<br />  When I get to Toledo after doing the nomad power cell mission, Slave I is replaced with a starflier. All my weapons and cargo have been robbed too, all that remains is my cash. I thought it might have something to do with the ship but I tried going back to an earlier save and reluctantly doing the mission in the Anubis, but the same happens. Also, I assume there must be a cut scene which doesn't happen leaving me totally stranded as there is no way out of the system, no jobs in the bar either. Someone please help. More information available at request, Thx</div>

			<div class="content">I dont know if this topic is still looked at...I hope it is!
<br />
<br />So okay...what if FL crashes WITHOUT any mods in it?
<br />
<br />What I mean is that when I start FL up from the EXE folder...I gets to the splash screen loading up then I drop to desktop and get a fatal error. And yes, I have already tried reinstalling...didn't help. And yes, I have check Microsoft's own support site...and didn't help.
<br />
<br />Finally, to add salt to the wound; I could play FL on my same computer, the ONLY difference is that I dl'ed a new graphics update for my graphics card...which should NOT have changed anything...but its a possability...I REALLY hope someone reads this!

			<div class="content">All,
<br />I installed the &quot;All Good Things&quot; Mod and get through the story til I have to go and rescue Rheinland operative (Von Claussen) in the Frankfurt system. While trying to use the jump gate from New Berlin to Frankfurt my computer will reboot after the &quot;Loading&quot; message comes on in the jump tunnel. 
<br />
<br />I have turned all other mods off (de-activated). I have purchased one of the &quot;Privateer&quot; ships (Centurion) with &quot;Green Terror&quot; turrets and &quot;Nomad Cannons&quot;. Could this be the problem? Does anyone know why I cannot get through the Frankfurt jump tunnel without a forced, undocumented rebooting of my computer? I am about to give up completely on this whole modding idea. It has been troublesome to say the least and I HATE HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE STORY TIME AFTER TIME!! ARGHHHHHHHH!
<br />Please help!
<br />Steve &quot;protomatter&quot; Williams

			<div class="content">@Everyone else - sorry, never noticed replies in this thread before.
<br />
<br />@Above - fraid its best off to ask the advice of the creator of that mod. What i would say is save your save games (my documents/my games/freelancer/accts/singleplayer/) to a safe place (zip em up perhaps?) in your my documents folder first. THen - deactivate mod, UN-install FL and delete the mod.
<br />
<br />Now reinstall FL, redownload and install mod - and return save games to position you took em from. Now try again.
<br />
<br />The ONLY time i heard about something even remotely like this was when one of my testers got kicked to desktop going through a jumpgate. There was no coding error at all - it was a 'glitch' - which disappeared as soon as he did a complete reinstall and redownloaded the mod.</div>
