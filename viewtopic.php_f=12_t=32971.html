			<div class="content">From the NY Times
<br />For Asimov, Robots Were Friends. Not So for Will Smith.
<br />
<br />July 15, 2004
<br /> By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN 
<br />
<br />
<br />At the beginning of the film &quot;I, Robot,&quot; which opens
<br />tomorrow, we seem to be in a world that has yet to even
<br />imagine the idea of a robot. It all seems a bit retro, even
<br />by today's standards, let alone 2035, the year the plot
<br />unfolds. Will Smith, as Detective Del Spooner, groggily
<br />shuts off an old-fashioned alarm clock. His bathtub has
<br />claw feet. His footwear? Vintage black Converse sneakers. 
<br />
<br />Spooner's apartment might even resemble the world in which
<br />Isaac Asimov lived when he wrote the stories in his 1950
<br />book &quot;I, Robot,&quot; on which the movie is very loosely based.
<br />The first story appeared in 1939, when Asimov was just 19,
<br />a galaxy far, far away by science fiction standards. The
<br />tales appeared in pulp magazines with names like Super
<br />Science Stories and Astounding Science Fiction. 
<br />
<br />And though they imagined worlds far in the future - the
<br />first takes place in 1998! - even the pocket calculator
<br />makes no appearance. Asimov's scientists use slide rules.
<br />Aside from the notion of a robot's &quot;positronic brain&quot; (a
<br />term Asimov later called gobbledygook), technological
<br />innovations involve allusions to a &quot;dielectrode plate&quot; and
<br />a &quot;spectroreflector&quot; that even Tom Swift might have found
<br />quaint. 
<br />
<br />The movie's retro material, then, may be a kind of a wink
<br />at its antique source. But in his book, Asimov also
<br />declared war on those who think about robots with fear and
<br />trembling, dreading the dangers of technological change.
<br />The new movie, though, often seems to oppose Asimov's view.
<br />Spooner hates robots, and he may have good reason. So
<br />Asimov's old battles are being engaged yet again and may be
<br />worth thinking about because they touch on so much more
<br />than android design. 
<br />
<br />Asimov's robots can certainly seem born of a more innocent,
<br />less knowing world: one loves hearing children's stories,
<br />another malfunctions by drunkenly going around in circles,
<br />a third may or may not be masquerading as a well-meaning
<br />human politician. Surely this gently imagined future is
<br />hopelessly eclipsed now that we have seen the killer
<br />android of &quot;Terminator 2&quot; morph into any human shape out of
<br />blobs of mercury, or watched the machines of the &quot;Matrix&quot;
<br />trilogy rule the post-apocalyptic earth, plugging humans
<br />into energy pods with elaborate software. 
<br />
<br />The movie, as if troubled by its innocent origins, even
<br />tries to leave the book behind. (A more faithful adaptation
<br />is in a published screenplay for &quot;I, Robot,&quot; written in the
<br />1970's by Harlan Ellison.) Any similarities that remain are
<br />on the surface. 
<br />
<br />This film, directed by Alex Proyas, is actually a hybrid
<br />that developed out of a robotic murder mystery by the
<br />screenwriter Jeff Vintar and was then transformed after the
<br />acquisition of rights to Asimov's book. That hybrid
<br />character exists even in its views of technology. The movie
<br />wants to look backward toward Asimov and sideways toward
<br />Hollywood technothrillers. It promises a fresh embrace of
<br />technology while rounding up the usual technological
<br />suspects. It is torn between the two sides but is far more
<br />interested in one than the other. 
<br />
<br />This was not Asimov's approach. In 1956 Asimov explained
<br />that before beginning his robot stories he had tired of the
<br />typical robot plot about &quot;the creature that turned against
<br />its creator, the robot that became a threat to humanity.&quot;
<br />That plot was there with the very invention of the word in
<br />Karel Capek's 1921 Czech play, &quot;R.U.R.&quot; and became
<br />disturbingly perverse in Fritz Lang's 1927 film,
<br />&quot;Metropolis.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I didn't see robots that way,&quot; Asimov wrote. &quot;After all,
<br />all devices have their dangers.&quot; For him robots were
<br />&quot;machines, not metaphors.&quot; 
<br />
<br />So the Frankenstein question was irrelevant for Asimov. In
<br />his stories fear of robots is irrational; it impedes
<br />understanding and leads to robotics researchers being
<br />called &quot;blasphemers and demon creators.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The robot, for Asimov, was humanly designed and had
<br />built-in safeguards. His character, the human
<br />robopsychologist Susan Calvin, even asserts that robots
<br />differ from people because they are &quot;essentially decent.&quot;
<br />That belief came from Asimov's famous Three Laws of
<br />Robotics, which were hard-wired into every robot. (They
<br />also appear on screen at the opening of the new film.) The
<br />first law guaranteed that a robot could not harm a human
<br />being or through inaction allow a human being to come to
<br />harm; the second was that a robot had to obey human beings
<br />except when doing so would conflict with the first law; and
<br />the third was that a robot had to protect itself as long as
<br />that did not conflict with the first or second law. 
<br />
<br />But these laws weren't the source of Asimov's optimism.
<br />Asimov kept exploring how complex these laws were, how much
<br />they depended upon interpretation, and how unpredictable
<br />robotic intelligence could become. What if multiple people
<br />are being harmed and a robot had to act? What if one person
<br />had to be harmed to save another? Such dilemmas could cause
<br />robotic confusion and delusion. Asimov said, though, that
<br />an underlying logic would allow the difficulties to be
<br />sorted out. 
<br />
<br />This was Asimov's rebellion against the Frankenstein plot,
<br />and it was one reason he wielded such influence among
<br />scientists. Even when Asimov's robots begin to resemble
<br />people in intelligence and subtlety, Asimov rarely sees
<br />apocalypse in the offing. 
<br />
<br />These views made him seem a kind of retro anomaly in later
<br />sci-fi, with its dark Frankensteinian visions of nuclear
<br />horrors and technology run amok. In Kubrick's &quot;2001: A
<br />Space Odyssey&quot; the computer HAL must be dismantled before
<br />it kills more astronauts. In the first &quot;Terminator&quot; film,
<br />the killer android is sent from the future to insure the
<br />dominance of machine intelligence. The mad scientist of old
<br />melodrama becomes the mad machine of sci-fi, often aided by
<br />the requisite greedy corporation: the usual suspects. These
<br />themes run riot in the new film of &quot;I, Robot&quot; as well,
<br />which is what can make it seem so alien to Asimov. 
<br />
<br />There is, of course, much room for variation and
<br />exploration. Technology can be put in its place. The first
<br />&quot;Star Wars&quot; films, for example, celebrate an almost
<br />pretechnological universe in which the heroes fight with
<br />ramshackle equipment, aided by clanking, whirring droids
<br />and the ancient laws of the Force. 
<br />
<br />The robot could also become an answer to humanity: its
<br />finest creation and greatest hope. Ridley Scott's 1982 film
<br />&quot;Blade Runner&quot; made the mad scientist and mad corporation
<br />far more nefarious than their robotic creations. And in
<br />Steven Spielberg's 2001 film, &quot;A.I.,&quot; robotic intelligence
<br />ends up transcending the human altogether; even flesh
<br />becomes a memory. 
<br />
<br />But these opposing visions coexist. On the one hand is the
<br />Frankenstein plot, on the other the quest for salvation; on
<br />the one hand is the danger of technology, on the other its
<br />promise. &quot;I, Robot&quot; can't quite decide. But perhaps when it
<br />comes to robots, we are all hybrids.</div>

			<div class="content">That's what happens when you make a book into a movie.  Look at Starship Troopers.  I have both movies and the book.  The first Starship Troopers was barely based on the book.  The only similarities between that book and the movie, were some of the characters' names that were used.  That was pretty much it.  Even the story was slaughtered for the movie.  So, as long as you don't expect the movie to be anything like the book, you'll probably have a good time.</div>

<br />
<br />Frogive me, im going to go Aranic Here:
<br />Im trying to overcome the basic dilemma of Machine superiority programming(When the machine AI slaughters the humans, deeming them unneccesary) by incorporating a Command core that states the basic operation template of the program, only able to be modified by neural interfacing with 3 diferent people. above that is a sub-command shell contining current tasks and commands, this is still not modifiable by the program, but can be modified by a neural interface with one person, this shell stores current long-term tasks and ovverides.
<br />The last two shells are program-controlled and dictate short-term function, shell 2 being the short-term task itself, and shell 1 being the actions required to carry out that task. The AI pogramming itself is interfaced with this. It is literally impossible for the AI to override or 'ignore' the Shell 3 and 4 commands, but can ovveride the 1 and 2 commads by deleting them.
<br />The problem with apocalypse-scale AI's is that they do not have this restriction system and can do whatever they want.
<br />Im incorporating this system into my latest 'Prometheus' (AI-7/I) and 'Gaia' (AI-8b/I) projects</div>

			<div class="content">I think the problem is that all classic SF writers wrote their books because they felt they had sth to say. Todays movies are made because the filmmakers feel they could make a profit (and that references to classic writer upon whose books the films are supposedly made could attract audience that otherwise would not come to see the movies). Consumerism... Hollywood is just one (tho probably the most prominent) example. Thinking soils the brain, so to speak...
