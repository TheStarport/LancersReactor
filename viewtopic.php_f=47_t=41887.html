<br />
<br />Trent is sitting in the Manhattan bar, drinking a Liberty Ale. He then sees Juni come in. He embraces her.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hi Juni. I haven't seen you in a while since that promotion.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, it turns out to be really boring.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why is that?&quot; Trent drinks his Ale.
<br />
<br />&quot;Because I don't get to go on missions anymore. I have to command LSF agents now, and some of them are real asses. They can't kill a Liberty Rogue! Unimaginable how they got into the LSF. Either way, I have to tell you something.
<br />Meet me on Planet Junyo.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? Junyo...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent finishes his ale. &quot;Oooo...&quot;
<br />
<br />Juni glared. &quot;Please Trent. Meet me on Junyo as soon as possible.&quot;

			<div class="content">(I broke up what I have written so far into parts because for some reason there is a limit to how many words i can put in at a time)
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine. Unbelievable. What the hell would you want there. Why not Curacao?&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent made his way to his ship and took off. He put in &quot;Planet Junyo&quot;
<br />on his Neural Net. It then displayed the shortest path to there.
<br />
<br />&quot;Dammit rogues!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Drop your cargo. You've got H-Fuel and I want it now!&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent then opened fire on the rogue ships. His Stiletto destroyed them in no time. He found an unidentifed gun in the wreckage. He tractored it in.
<br />
<br />He flew to Baltimore Shipyard, and then was at the Colorado jump gate. Again he was ambushed, but this time by Outcasts. They also went down as fast as the rogues. &quot; Un- fricking believble. More and more bastard criminals are coming for me.&quot;
<br />
<br />He went through Colorado without being attacked. But, when he made it to Kepler, his trade lane was disrupted and saw 4 Xenos piloting Falcons. &quot;Since when can Xenos afford Falcons?&quot; He attacked them, and was in disbelief.
<br />They were using Nomad Weapons. Fortunately they didn't bother to equip themselves with cruise disruptors, so it wasn't difficult to escape.
<br />
<br />He called Orillion on his neural net communicator. &quot;Orillion. Are you there?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes Colonel Trent. What is wrong?&quot; &quot;Ehhh it's just Trent. I was just attacked by Xeno Falcons equipped with Nomad Weapons!&quot; He could hear Orillion spit some liquid out his mouth. &quot;WHAT? Where did you get attacked by them?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;In the middle of the tradelane between the Colorado jump gate and Ames Research Station, in Kepler.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok Trent. We are sending agents to investigate.&quot;

			<div class="content">Trent got to the Shikoku jumpgate. Junyo wasn't too far away. After he had made it to Shikoku, he saw some Blood Dragons ambushing a Samura convoy. &quot;Ahh, old times,&quot; he thought to himself. He took the tradelane and got to Junyo. When he landed, he saw Juni with Lord Hakkera.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hakkera! I haven't seen you in a long time...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; I know, Trent. I gave up my prefect position to live on Kyoto. I was getting stressed, what with all of the things going on.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; I guess I'll be able to see you a lot more now. I see Juni waving. Let me see what is going on, why she told me to go to Junyo.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; Juni! Are you going to tell me what is going on?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; Trent, I wanted to propose to you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; Propose what?&quot;
<br />
<br />Juni kissed him gently on the cheek, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes!&quot;  Juni and Trent embraced. They kissed. Hakkera sees them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Jun'ko, Mr. Trent, you remind me of my younger ages.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hakkera!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sure we do.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hold on Trent. I'm asking Orillion if we can have the wedding on the Osiris.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Orillion, this is Colonel Zane.&quot; &quot;Trent, I don't believe he still calls me that-&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Colonel Zane, what can I do for you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I proposed to Trent. Can we have the wedding on the Osiris?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course! It's sitting in Texas anyway...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you, Orillion!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Did you hear that, Trent? We can wed on the Osiris!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes! I'm going to get you the best dress money can buy.&quot;
<br />
<br />           The next day they were both on the Osiris.
<br />
<br />At the reception Trent saw a lot of old friends- Von Claussen, Tobias, Hakkera, Cobo, Kress, King, Quintaine, Sinclair, and Orillion. King walked up to Trent.
<br />
<br />&quot;Trent, it's good to see you. Looks like you're not going to be freelancing for a long time, doesn't it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;To tell you the truth, King, I really don't know.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; Did you know? I proposed to Sinclair.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Really, what did she say?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The usual- she's thinking about it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice...&quot; Von Claussen comes over.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mr. Trent, it is good to see you again. I remember when I first met you on Holstein. You have changed a lot.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; I guess so, Von Claussen.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I am going to the refreshments.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Wait for me!&quot; Said King.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tobias! Where have you been when they kicked you out of the Bretonian Military?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ahh, I have stayed at home. I have incredible news for you. I have recently dug up some documents which belonged to your great-grandmother. I hired a lawyer to examine it, and it turns out to be....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? What is it?&quot;

			<div class="content">&quot;A will left to you leaving 13.5 million credits.&quot; Trent almost fainted.
<br />
<br />&quot;How do I get it then?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Take this.&quot; He gives Trent a piece of paper. &quot;Give this to the court on Leeds.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Unbelievable, Tobias. Thank you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't thank me. But when I need your help, please assist me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I will Tobias.&quot; He sees Juni waving.
<br />
<br />&quot;Juni? Is it about to start?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. Let's go.&quot;
<br />
<br />5 minutes later, Hakkera is saying the wedding vows. Then Juni and Trent kiss.
<br />Then comes applause!
<br />
<br />&quot;Juni, i have some incredible news.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Tobias dug up old documents that were found to belong to my great-grandmother. It was a will leaving me almost 14 million credits.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, my god. How did she get that much money?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; I don't know, but one thing is for sure.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What's that?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We are going on our honeymoon.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I know where- the Cruise Liner Hawaii in Sigma-19.&quot;
<br />
<br />         The next day, they were on the Hawaii, in one of the swimming pools.
<br />Some guy said to Juni &quot;Hey hotstuff, wanna go for a ride?&quot; She threw a shoe at him, hitting his face. His expression drooped. &quot;'Guess not.&quot; Trent laughed. Half an hour later they went back to their suite and ate. &quot;This kicks the ass of Synth Paste many times,&quot; Said Trent. Juni said,&quot;Yes, it does. Now if only I had a-&quot;
<br />The ship's command made an announcement. &quot;All guests, please be advised that GMG ships are on an intercept course to the cruise liner.&quot; &quot;Oh, my god,&quot; said Juni.&quot;Why the hell are GMG ships attacking a cruise liner?&quot; &quot;Because they're fat bastards,&quot; replied Trent. &quot;I'm going to my ship to attack the GMG ships. You stay here.&quot; Suddenly the ship started shaking violently. &quot;Nevermind, Juni. Get what you can and get out of here. We can finish our honeymoon somewhere else. Hurry!&quot;
<br />
<br />          They got to their ships and launched. &quot;Holy-. look at all those ships! There has to be at least 20 Falcons!&quot; Trent launched a Firestalker missle and destroyed an engine. He then finished that Falcon off. Thankfully, they weren't the only guests who were retaliating against the GMG. When the fight was over, 1 GMG worker tried to escape, but someone hit him with a cruise disruptor and finished him off. A guest said that the GMG probably attacked the Hawaii because of the Hogosha and Outcast artifact trading. The Outcasts recently cut off the GMG from their artifact affairs, making the Hogosha their primary artifact dealers.
<br />The guests wondered why the GMG would criminalize themselves to get at the Hogosha.
<br />
<br />          Back on Manhattan, Juni showed Trent some unbelievable news. The Hawaii had been destroyed. A data cache salvaged showed that nobody was able to get out because somehow the docking doors were jammed. Authorities believe that there were at least 3,000 casualties. Witnesses say that the Gas Miner's Guild destroyed the ship, and when police went to Sigma-13 to arrest the GMG, they were all gone. &quot;I'm glad we left the ship before it was too late, Juni.&quot;
<br />&quot;Me too Trent, but it doesn't make sense. Why the hell would the GMG, a noncriminal organization, get so pissed off about lost revenue over artifacts when they make damned H-Fuel for Kusari?&quot; &quot;Hell, I'm as confused as you are.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Something very strange happened- Tobias is in prison. Trent and Juni left to BPA Glutton (Bretonian Police Authority Prison Ship Glutton) to bail him out. He was taken to New London Court, but not until being ambushed by Mollys. Their Bloodhounds were annihilated by Trent's Skyblast B's. &quot;Those really come in handy, don't they,&quot; said Juni.
<br />
<br />&quot;All the time,&quot; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />         An hour later, Tobias was released, and went back to his equipment shop. &quot;Tobias, why did you go to prison? You had me worried.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Trent, I got into fight at the bar. Some redneck named Jack Peterson started...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh. Take better care of yourself, Tobias. I might not always be around to get you out of trouble.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I know, Trent.&quot;
<br />
<br />         A week later, another strange thing happened. Trent returned from a meeting with King to find Juni unconscious on the floor. She had a long gash on her arm. Trent took her to Medical. After she had regained consciousness, she told Trent what had happened. &quot;I opened the door to someone that said they have a delivery for me, and when he came in, he lifted his arms, and then it seemed like I was bound by invisible ropes. He said something about &quot;a taste of what is in store for you&quot;, and then cut my arm with a strange-looking knife of some sort. Then everything went black.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank God you're alright. We have to get as far away from here as possible.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Reminds me of a while ago.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's go to Freeport 9.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Freeport 9? The Zoners built that many Freeports?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah. The most recent one is Freeport 10 in Tau-37.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Tau-37? Where- oh, never mind. Let's go to Freeport 9, wherever that is.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hmm, the LSF must've not cared about the goings-on in the Edge Worlds. Since Freeport 9 is surrounded by Outcast and Corsair patrols, we don't have to worry about being attacked- much. I did jobs for them earlier, but since they only concerned Bounty Hunters, we will probably get attacked by them. Fortunately, they are nowhere as deadly as the Outcasts or Corsairs.&quot;
<br />
<br />          2 Weeks later they got to Freeport 9. &quot;Wow, Trent, I have never seen anything like it before.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, the green dust clouds? I've seen quite a lot of them.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Want to hear something weird?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why is it that nobody has salvaged most of the 80-year- war derelicts in Sigma-13? I've been there once, and I have collected lots of ultra-powerful &quot;classified&quot; weapons. There's even a Junker base there, and there's still lots of weapons on the derelicts.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Later that night...
<br />
<br />&quot;Juni, I love you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I love you too, Trent.&quot; She kisses him. &quot;I have been wondering something lately. Why didn't we get together earlier?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I wanted to, but you were always busy.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, that's going to change. Good night.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You too.&quot; Then Trent's neural net communicator beeped. It was Orillion.
<br />
<br />&quot;Orillion? What's wrong?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nothing. I still don't believe that you were attacked by those Xenos. We've searched all of Kepler. No signs of Falcons or Nomad weapons.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sorry to hear that, but I really was attacked by them. I even scanned their cargo.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine. Orillion out.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Trent, what was that about? You were attacked by Nomads?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, but by Xeno Falcons bearing Nomad weaponry. Orillion has investigated it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;God. I thought that was over after we reactivated the Hypergates.&quot; Trent embraced Juni.
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't worry. They didn't even bother to mount cruise disruptors on their ships!&quot;
<br /> 
<br />           After Juni went to sleep, Trent was still awake. He thought about Juni.
<br />&quot;She is a goddess, with her perfect eyes, curves, and skin.&quot;  He had always thought of her as very attractive, with an excellent personality to match. He soon fell asleep.
<br />
<br />            The next day.....
<br />
<br />&quot;Remember when we were escaping from Liberty and you said that we might not make it? I'm glad we did. I didn't want the Navy to get you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;To tell you the truth, I didn't want them to get you, either.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What if we never met?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I think you would keep freelancing, if you got a ship. I would still be an LSF commander.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And we wouldn't have helped the Order kick the Nomads out of Sirius. I wonder who would've done what we did.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Me too.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And remember when that Navy officer was about to shoot me because that artifact theif showed me what he stole off of Pygar? Thanks for saving me there.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't mention it. He was about to kill me too!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;By the way, did you know that Pygar is in this system?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It is?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, with a jumphole to Sigma-17 not too far away. Freeport 7 was located in Sigma-17.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And Orillion was there before it was destroyed, I think. He was trying to buy the Dom Kavash artifact from the theif.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Makes some sen-&quot; The station started shaking. &quot;What the ****?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;All hands, this is the Command. We have lots of Red Hessian ships on our screen. They are attacking the station!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why the **** are the Red Hessians attacking a neutral Zoner station?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Because they are Satan's helpers, that's why. Juni, you wait here. I'll help the retaliation along.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't get yourself killed!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't worry, I'll be fine.&quot; He kissed Juni.
<br />
<br />He got into his Sabre and launched. &quot;What the hell ships are those?&quot; Sure enough, he saw ships with the texture of Border Worlds fighters, yet with a completely new design. Fortunately, they didn't fare too well against Trent's Skyblast B's.
<br />
<br />He docked with the station. Juni ran up to him and embraced him.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm fine, Juni. The Hessians were using ships I've never seen before. They had the texture of my Sabre, but the design was different.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Unbelievable. Why the hell is it that wherever we are, we get attacked? First Hawaii, then Manhattan, and now this. I feel like I'm constantly being watched.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;Juni, don't worry about what happened just now. They barely damaged the station. Even the Corsairs and Bounty Hunters helped kill them. The Corsairs have a thirst for Hessian blood.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Unbelievable. Now the attacks are suicidal.&quot; Trent embraced her.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's a good thing. That means that no one will perish in the attacks, unless if the opposite side is winning.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I guess you're right, Trent. Are we going to spend the rest of our lives here?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, we're not. Where do you want to go?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why not kill some Rogues in Liberty?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nah, they all went to join The Order. But the Xenos didn't.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ohhhh...., but where will we live in Liberty? I don't want to live on Manhattan.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Me neither. But we can live on the Corsair homeworld.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I've heard about it, but only as a rumor. Are you sure it exists?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;With a connection to there from this system!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But... is it dangerous in the Corsair system?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If you're trusted by them, not really. But keep an eye out for Bounty Hunters, as in the Edge Worlds they are nowhere as dangerous as in Liberty.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">After Juni woke up, Trent told her to close her eyes and follow him. When she opened her eyes she freaked out!
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh my god, Trent. Is that really for me?&quot; She looked at a blue Titan.
<br />
<br />&quot;A legendary Corsair ship. Damn, it's so nice!&quot; She embraced Trent so hard that it was hard for him to breathe.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ooo... Juni, I get it, you love the ship. Want to test it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'd love to!&quot;
<br />
<br />            They both got into their ships. &quot;You might not like the backwards-only firing turret.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? Why wouldn't I? I could plink at others while in pursuit! Either way, it doesn't really matter. It has a Sunslayer torpedo launcher! This really kills the Liberty ships. It even turns good, too!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The Corsairs are marvels at engineering, aren't they?&quot;</div>
