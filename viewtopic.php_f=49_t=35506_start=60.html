			<div class="content">Carla was up to speed now. The month they had trained had paid off for the both of them. She had learned to control her anger and she had taught Darkstone more of the unused force powers she had gained while on the darkside. He, though was reluctant to teach her the Jedi mind wall that he had learned, as it was too close to the darkside and might tempt her back to it. He would though, one day, when she was ready. For now, they headed to the fighters that were sitting side by side on the family land. They were matching X-Wings. Darkstone had a second one constructed just for her. It had a mental link set up to the R5 droid that Carla would carry on her ship. It&#8217;s controls were set to a Jedi&#8217;s reflexes as well. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I want you to meet my wife, Carla. &#8220;Darkstone explained as they headed for space. &#8220;She does not have the force ability about her, but her love and heart more than make up for it.&#8221; He finished. Carla saw a smile on his face at the though it had produced. 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, above Yavin, the remains of the space battle that settled little. Both fleets escaped with little remaining. The ship building facilities were scrap metal. Nothing left, nor anyone left alive. A Jedi fighter cruises through the wreckage. Ships torn apart. Parts of a bridge. Large drive engines, all floating in the sea o stars. Reminders of a war. Master Jedi Esquilax guided his craft skillfully among the debris. He sensed some thing. A presence. But, he could not tell where from. Not close, but near enough to view th carnage this battle had caused.  He continued his inspection. Searching for any life that might have survived, how ever remotely. He was one of only a hand full of trained Jedi who survived the destruction of the world of Coruscant. It was a tragic loss to the galaxy. Trillions of lives lost, knowledge lost, great minds lost, forever. He wondered how any could see this and continue to support the remnant. How could not any other not want to rise to the occasion and give hand to fight back.
<br />
<br />A shadow. A shadow hidden among the wreckage watched. It observed the intruder as he made his way through it&#8217;s domain. As the ship jumped to hyper space, the shadow moved, ever so slowly. It raised an antenna and transmitted a signal. Destination? The far reaches of the galaxy. Then it moved deeper among the debris. Hidden again until another intruded in its lair.
<br />
<br />Darkstone and Carla set their crafts down on the landing pads of Bespin. It still produces gas for sale every where. It was also where they would find Darkstone&#8217;s wife. She chose this world to stay while her husband was away, so as not to become a target to be used against him. Her name was Karen. She met him as he entered the space port with a hug and a kiss. She looked over his shoulder at Carla. She had received the message that she would be coming along but was unprepared for how beautiful the woman was. It struck her strange that one so beautiful had also been so evil. But, she knew all that had transpired and she welcomed Carla and turned to the waiting grav craft that would take them to their home.
<br />
<br />They rode in silence as the waited to arrive home. But, there was peace there. Peace that nearly wasn&#8217;t. But, thanks tot he force and Darkstone, it is. Karen got the door when the arrived at their quarters. Spartan by many standards, they seemed too sterile, even for a Jedi to Carla. They lacked that , home, touch. But, there was an area, apparently reserved for meditation that over looked the clouds surrounding the city. The view was breath taking. Carla moved to a pad and sat, seeking to meditate while Darkstone and his wife got reacquainted. 
<br />
<br />An hour later, there was a knock at the door. It brought Carla back to the present. She had seen the dark one again in her meditations, calling her. This left a frown on her face. Darkstone noticed and moved to the window side of the room and sat. He waited for her to speak first. She began, hesitantly, &#8220;There is an image, a face I see when I meditate&#8221; she spoke, her voice on an even keel. &#8220; It is a dark face, a, Sith&#8221; she said, eyes looking away, &#8220;he was calling me to come back to him.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Darkstone rose and moved beside Carla and sat. He raised her chine so that she looked him in the eye. &#8220;You are not alone in this fight&#8221; he spoke soothingly to her, &#8220;I and others care about you and will do what ever we have to, to protect you.&#8221; She nodded assent, but inside, she doubted her confidence to resist the darkside and its call. She did not trust herself at all. She had been blinded by a lie from the beginning and now, was hearing that lie again. She was weak to fight against it. It was the hate before that fueled her drive, but now, that was gone.
<br />
<br />She rose and walked to the window, staring at a security craft as it flew by. She wanted to reach out to it, to catch a ride to any where but here. She wanted to be free of this thing, from the force. But, she knew she would never be. But, now she knew she had family and she had her father back too. She turned to darkstone and took his hand and led him out side. To where the could see the clouds first hand. There she spoke her fears and her doubts to him. She asked his help and wisdom as to what to do. He answered her questions, spoke of ideas and dreams, of desires, but also of the force and helped her understand why, why she felt the way she did, why she feared falling back to the dark side. He also spoke of one who could teacher her peace and how to find it. He told her he would contact Gowserpaul and together they would help her over come the dark side desires and powers.
<br />
<br />After returning to his quarters, Darkstone put a call into GowserPaul. He knew that he was on Dagobah, but would still ask if he could come here, if not, they would go there.
<br />
<br />Admiral Tawakalna was weary of the day. They were orbiting Geonosis for a month now. There was a need for patience. A virtue that he did not possess. The fleet was damaged and lost all the ships in the fight at the ship yard and the loss of the ship yard as well. That would not bode well for him with the dark master. Though, he had not seen nor heard from her in a month. Not since she left the Death Star at Naboo. He, however, would still carry out his duty. Until he could confirm she was dead, he would not risk the wrath again. He was awaiting word on the second ship yards readiness to begin to produce ships. 
<br />
<br />The Death Star was in a secret location to continue the building of its shell. He had over seen some of the continuation and was pleased to see that Indy was indeed a capable commander. His first task, was building again a sizeable fleet and escorting the death Star to the next world and begin the landing of troops to control it. Once fear moved on the world, it would be his to control. The Admiral was a wise tactician and would pass up worlds that would defend themselves in order to control those that would fear him and the fleet. That would increase the size of supplies and the fear would spread to other systems like a virus. It would weaken a planet capable of fighting, from within. Then, he would possess the planet, for his master. He would have a position in the new Empire.

			<div class="content">The Death Star was in a secret location to continue the building of its shell. He had over seen some of the continuation and was pleased to see that Indy was indeed a capable commander. His first task, was building again a sizeable fleet and escorting the death Star to the next world and begin the landing of troops to control it. Once fear moved on the world, it would be his to control. The Admiral was a wise tactician and would pass up worlds that would defend themselves in order to control those that would fear him and the fleet. That would increase the size of supplies and the fear would spread to other systems like a virus. It would weaken a planet capable of fighting, from within. Then, he would possess the planet, for his master. He would have a position in the new Empire.
<br />
<br />Captain Jagged was still alive, but, not for long. The Admiral had removed him from the flagship and placed him in command of a light hunter craft. He was to be bait for any republic fleets. It was his job to enter a system, and attempt to draw a few ships into a battle then flee back to the Imperial fleet so that the followers could then be destroyed. His life and skill were on the line. The admiral had held him by the throat and looked him deep in the eyes. And, barley above a whisper uttered a death sentence, &#8220;Fail me again, and you will see the vacuum of space, first hand&#8221;. The admiral was not concerned if the republic fleet destroyed one ship or not, he wanted bait to piece by piece , take apart the republic fleet. It was no concern of his if the Captain died in the process.
<br />
<br />He knew that if he could divide the fleet, he could destroy it. And, a lowly hunter craft was not worth sending a fleet after, only one or two craft would be sent. Then, the ship would bring the prey to the hounds, to be destroyed. The Admiral would have laughed, if he had been able to. The scars were a constant reminder to him, to complete the tasks at hand. He would have his revenge on the Republic. 
<br />
<br />Captain Jagged prepared for the jump. He had the revers course set, he would be save, no matter what was behind him or in front of him. His worries would be over soon. He would find a new world and begin again. His crew was loyal to him and would comply with the deception. They would jump into the system as planed, but would leave the moment they could execute the coordinate changes. They would leave a buoy with the location of the fleet. That would by them all the time they needed.
<br />
<br />The jump began well. Jagged was on his way to freedom. On his way to a new life far from Admiral Tawakalna and the fear he brought. Jagged never sought this type of life. He just wanted to be the captain of a ship, nothing more.
<br />
<br />Bargib was in command of the assembled Republic main fleet. It was massive. Thirteen Bulwark battle cruisers as well as over twenty Republic assault ships. More than a match for most fleets. He was ready as soon as word was given as to the location of the Remnant fleet. The sooner they were dealt with, the sooner the death Star could be dealt with as well. That would require every capital ship available, unless they could find a weakness.
<br />
<br />Bargib had just returned to the bridge when a ship popped out of hyper space. A lone hunter and alone at that. Prime target to remove. He was about to order the fleet to open fire, when the ship launched something and jumped back into hyperspace. &#8220;Track that ship and dispatch one battle cruiser and three assault ships&#8221; cam the command from the admiral. &#8220;Take prisoners if at all possible&#8221; was also relayed over the com before the ships jumped.
<br />
<br />In the mean time, he scanned the object dropped by the ship. It was recorder buoy. He had a ship bring it aboard and hook it up to a droid to find out any information, if possible. He needed any data he could get his hands on.
<br />
<br />Captain Richardson of the Bulwark cruiser Alpha three five, was ready when they dropped out of hyper space. They were considerable distance from where this ride began. Too remote for an ambush. Still he was cautious in approaching the ship. He ordered the assault ships to bracket the hunter. They needed prisoners first, the destruction of the ship, second. They sent a communications over, to surrender or die. It was replied to with a hologram of a man with the rank of a captain. He removed his cap and spoke in normal tones. &#8220;Captain Jagged here&#8221; the man replied, &#8220;I request your terms&#8221;. The man must have not heard the com message, so Richardson repeated the demands and added there was no other terms.
<br />
<br />The message seemed to distress the captain a great deal, in that he moved closer to the holoprojecter and spoke quickly, &#8220;I have information that would be useful to you, but I must be guaranteed safe passage afterward.&#8221;
<br />
<br />This puzzled Captain Richardson and said he would get back to him and broke the channel. He would get information on this from the Admiral. This seemed a prize worth keeping. This could be what Bargib needed.
<br />
<br />Half an hour later, the crew of the hunter was taken aboard the Battle cruiser and the hunter was destroyed. They set a course back to the fleet point. They would leave the interrogation to the Admiral.
<br />
<br />Bargib was looking over the report when an officer approached and handed him the information concerning the buoy. It had the location of a large Imperial fleet, strength and numbers. This seemed too hard to believe, but, as he was well armed, he decided to not pass up the chance. He ordered all ships to prepare to jump to hyper space on his mark.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p337138" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Bargib was looking over the report when an officer approached and handed him the information concerning the buoy. It had the location of a large Imperial fleet, strength and numbers. This seemed too hard to believe, but, as he was well armed, he decided to not pass up the chance. He ordered all ships to prepare to jump to hyper space on his mark. But seconds before he gave the command a communication came through. Priority one. That was extremely rare. He sat at the desk as a hologram formed of a man and woman. 
<br />
<br />Moment went buy before he came to the bridge. He gave the order to stand down, but on alert. Every one looked as if he had lost it. &#8220;I have my reasons, people, stand down for now, we attack in a few hours&#8221;.
<br />
<br />The imperial shuttle jumped into hyperspace. They had the location that was needed and engaged. Two, traveling together, was risky, but necessary to the plan. It would take all the discipline both could manage and then some to pull it off. There was great risk for all involved. The literally had hours before the fleet would jump as well and had to make the best of it that they could.	
<br />
<br />The drop brought them side by side with a Super Star destroyer. The command codes given and acknowledged. They moved to dock in the landing bay. The guard was ordered to report for duty and the Admiral alerted.
<br />
<br />On board the shuttle, both figures were putting on dark blue robes The dark master setting her hood low and the other following suit. He would walk beside an one step behind her, as if an apprentice. This would be dangerous, for both, if they slipped up. But, the dark one, eyes a blase with fire, was confident all would go as planed. She would control the situation, control the pace and who speak to the Admiral. She would order the super star to depart and leave the bulk of the fleet to be destroyed. The male had fashioned a new light saber to match the dark one. A different blade would give all away. Now, to pull it off. The Dark Lord touched the button to lower the ramp. She moved with purpose down and on to the deck. The troopers snapped to attention. The new captain was at the head of the line. It was DSQrn. He was a minor officer on board, but the admiral had promoted him as he could control him with no problem at all. As she neared him, he moved to intercept her. She mea4rly made a motions and he was pushed back into place. She headed to the door, the apprentice right on her heals. The Captain gave an order and the door was blocked, The Dark Lord stopped in her tracks.
<br />
<br />The Captain clutched his throat as he was lifted from the deck and brought in front of the woman. &#8220;Captain, move your men, before I do it and then remove you from this life&#8221; came the command, dripping in hate. Fear indwelt the officer, but he had to explain. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Admiral commanded me to escort you to his quarters as soon as you landed, my Lord.&#8221;
<br />
<br />I will see him, when I wish it, is that understood?&#8221; the command had finality to it and to hammer it home, the choke hold intensified almost to death, before releasing. Inform the Admiral, that I will see him in my quarters in one hour&#8221;. The dark master let the captain drop to the deck, gasping for air and exited the landing bay. As she did so, the captain relayed the message and the report to the admiral, as ordered.
<br />
<br />On the bridge, controls changed, coordinates entered and he ship jumped to hyperspace, minus its protective squadron of fighters. The crew could not change it and guessed who was doing it and stood back until control was returned to them.
<br />
<br />As the two entered the quarters, a blue energy overloaded the cameras and monitors while the second person set up the equipment to give a fake view of what was going on. Then the blue energy was gone. It appeared to the bridge crew that the two people were meditating and nothing unusual happening. The two could now confer, with out watchful eyes seeing them. They sat at a table and laid out the strategy and what they would do when they dropped out of hyper space. They had timed it out well, and the Imperial fleet would soon be destroyed, with out the Admiral knowing.
