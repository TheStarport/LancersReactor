			<div class="content">----------------------------Chapter 1: Spatial Rifts----------------
<br />
<br />          Captain Jonathan Harickson sat in his chair thinking. The Rhineland vessels were waiting for the large liberty battleship's respone. It was unfortunate for John to have come too far into the heart of Rhineland, especially right after the nomad incodent had happened for Rhineland was in full lockdown. Nothing was to move in or out of the border and John had illegally crossed into their space using a jump hole. He couldn't leave because a Liberty station needed heavy supplies quickly, yet if he pushed his way on the Rhinelanders sould surely destroy him. &quot;Please, we'll leave right after we help our allies.&quot; John pleaded but the opposing vessels only tightened thier circle around his ship and fired a few warning shots. &quot;Last time, leave or be destroyed!&quot; one of the Rhineland captain quickly responded as he fired a burst of lasers past Johnathan's clean battleship. It was truly a large jam, they couldn't leave thier allies to die and they couldn't go futher without threat of being destroyed. It was a total standoff, John could easily destroy small ships but cruisers were begining to come through the trade lanes towards the spot. &quot;I can't do this.&quot; John muttered to himself as his crewmen looked at him for orders. &quot;What if we transfer the supplies to you, then can you deliver it to the allies in sector G12?&quot; John asked hopefully. &quot;Affirmative, but it has to be checked first by us.&quot; John reluctantly dropped the supplies in space and left quickly, but warned them he would be back if they double crossed him. It was a long trip back to Liberty, calm yet boring. It wasn't really that John didn't like being in his quarters all day, it was just the silence made him nervous something would happen. John lied down trying to get some sleep when the ship jolted. &quot;What the hell?&quot; he yelled as he ran onto the bridge. &quot;What's going on?&quot; he asked just as he looked out the view screen. It was horrible, massive battle cruisers circled Planet Manhattan as they launched nuclear warheads into the planets defenses. &quot;Man the weapons full speed ahead! John yelled but it was too late. A large missle smashed into the side of the cruiser instantly killing everyone on it. &quot;Agh!&quot; John yelled as he sprang to his feet. Panting John looked at the time and decided to check things on the bridge. Mainly just to check if missles were heading toward his ship. He walked into onto the deck and was greeted by his officers. It was a celebration for they had reports Station Gamma had been fully resupplied. They're ship landed and John was sent to the admiral's office for debriefing. &quot;Good job out there John, you've prooved Libery right of your capabilities once again. Unfortunatley we have encountered an odd problem. Our scientist have been studying spaitial rift transportation methods and we haven't heard from em since. Sorry for this long day.&quot; John got up and got back into the cruiser. &quot;Sorry everyone, we got another mission but it should be quick.&quot; The crew grumbled but followed orders and lifted off into space. It was another boring trip to Tau 21 but they finaly made it and scanned the area. &quot;Sir, I'm picking up a large field of radiation and the L.S. Corusa's wreckage.&quot; They moved just out of the radiation field and sure enough the batter hull of the Liberty science vessel could be seen. &quot;I guess we know what happened now.&quot; John said slowly looking at the extensive damage. A loud beeping noise went off and everyone's eyes turned to the first mate. &quot;We're recieving a distress call from D2, do we procced sir?&quot; she said as she turned to John. &quot;Yes, take us to the area.&quot; They quickly sped through the gas clouds and came by a burning gass miner. &quot;Oh my god.&quot; John said as he saw a huge fleet bearing odd symbols on thier even stranger ships. Then the most unexpected happened, they vanished not cloaked, but completely dissapeared not even leaving a trace of their existance. The crew gasped and John ordered them to return to the New York System. While in the admiral's office John tried to tell him of the events with him being sent out on leave for hallucinations. He walked to the nearest bar and ordered a classic Liberty ale just when his pager rang. &quot;This isn't happening.&quot; he said as he ran out of the bar.
