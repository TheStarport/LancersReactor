			<div class="content">I ramble alot when I have an idea and a keyboard, so feel free to skip through if this gets boring.
<br />
<br />Does anyone else wish there was some sort of pacing in multiplayer?
<br />
<br />I find myself getting bored being able to get VHFS within an hour or so on a server.  I know characters aren't exactly long term investments in the Freelancer Online world, what with server stability issues and all, but it would still be nice to have SOME sort of reason to buy ships other than frigates and VHFS.  
<br />
<br />The single player game was paced perfectly, IMO, with the level requirements being limited by ones ability to complete missions, giving you a real reason to consider buying a Defender or Dragon or any other cool ship nobody would consider using online, due to the fact that the only thing restricting you from a purchase online is your ability to make money.  I know MP can't have missions, and so the level requirement from SP would be rendered moot, but that doesn't mean there isn't a way to pace it, at least somewhat.  Currently, people who have played the game have zero reason to use 90% of the ships and items.
<br />
<br />One way of pacing progression would be bringing back some sort of level requirements for items and ships, from SP.  But levels are arbitrary without real missions, because money is almost worthless when (from the very start) you can make 100k within 20 minutes trading in a rhino, if you know the universe decently.  If there were just some sort of way to create progression... something a little faster than SP, but which limited the ability of people to frigate straight up to VHF in a few hours.  Can anyone really say they wouldn't like to see a duel between a bloodhound and a defender?  When the two people were actually compelled, by the game mechanics, to use those ships?
<br />
<br />Perhaps... this is just a wild shot:
<br />Introduce some sort of tax on trades?  Depending on current rank.  So, if you ran out and tried to do a trade run that would give a huge wad of cash, but you were only rank 5, there would be a massive tax on your profits...  the tax could fade until you reached a high rank and would be considered on your own, perhaps.  It could be explained through some sort of big brother deal with the liberty officials, it might encourage people to buy a lower ship and make money on missions.  But then, higher players could just give them loads... then net worth would have to be modified to ignore credit trades... oh, and item trades... 
<br />
<br />bleh, I can see where this is going.  As long as rank/level is based on money, there's probably no way to pace any level requirements online.  Of course, there aren't even the requirements right now.
<br />
<br />Anyway, maybe it would work as a mod, after some tweaking.  I doubt DA would go through the trouble of adding a server feature that made the online facet of the game more complicated in any way, judging by the ship control features strangely absent from my keyboard config menu.  I just wish there was a real reason to utilize the pleathorea of ships and items one usually ignores after completing the game, because that's a whole lot of stuff to waste as training wheels...</div>

			<div class="content">Nerf the trade route, and improve the missions. If you ONLY did the missions in MP you'd find the game moved at a very nice pace (that's what I've done on my latest char, and after weeks of playing a few hours a night I have only now worked my way up to a Kusari Dragon with 2 Borrocos, 4 Angelitos, c6 Graviton shield, Adv thrusters, Adv CM dropper, Sunslayers and Driller mines).
<br />
<br />I'm quite pleasantly surprised by this set up cos I've found I can outmanouvre any VHF, and that my 2 borroco's kill c10 shields REALLY quick (2464 base dmg per sec, or 2956.8 per second against those c10 Positron shields... Muahahaha), and after they're out of nanos (if i last that long lol) I can hit em with a torp from close up and half the time score a kill against a fully decked out VHF... Well titans anyway, I haven't faced the more agile ones yet.
<br />
<br />Ofcourse my fighting style relies heavily on not getting hit in the first place, and so while taking on VHFs in my dagger ended in stalemate cos they never hit me and I never did any serious dmg to them, the slower turning Dragon makes things a tad riskier (seeing as the extra 2 power lvls really don't help you take many more hits from a freak firing a full salvo of nomad weaps...</div>

			<h3><a href="#p119448" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I think that's the right idea, Revenge... but after giving it some thought, I would put even more emphasis on missions.
<br />
<br />Here's the basic idea:
<br />Bring back the level requirements from SP.
<br />Leave all the money gains the same for missions/trading.
<br />Change rank/level to be affected ONLY by NUMBER OF MISSIONS completed, and the difficulty of each completed.
<br />
<br />Here's my reasoning:
<br />Missions are the only real risk associated with progression in the game.  Not only do you risk your life, but you also risk faction changes.  You have to make a choice when you take missions, who to offend and who to ally with.  You aren't able to avoid changing ANY faction changes, yet gain 30 levels, as you can with trading.
<br />
<br />If your level was based on missions only, it would still be profitable to trade (you're going to need that VHF money from somewhere), but since trading wouldn't affect level (or perhaps make it affect your level *very slowly*), you would still have to take the time to pick a side and do missions in order to advance levels and gain access to better equipment and ships, restoring the natural progression from SP.
<br />
<br />That'd be much more fun, IMO.  Any thoughts?</div>

			<div class="content">Missions? Time-consuming?  Not to boast, but it really isn't that hard to level with missions and most of my characters have been missions-only.  It usually takes me 2-3 missions (less if I manage to scavenge), to get about 12k.  From there I get Lane parts from Colorado, sell at London.  This gives me just enough to get Cavalier.  Do a few more missions to outfit it with the best shields and some Rippers/Skyrails (depending on lag).  Then it's Rheinland, where it takes a bit longer given they only give 40k at most for a mission, but eventually I get the falcon and the rest is pretty straightfoward.
<br />
<br />This takes only takes about 6 hours or so, though I've never gotten an accurate time, given how I like to screw around alot.  The key, especially in Rheinland, is to pick only missions where you only have to kill one specific target.  Frankfurt, for some reason, offers a lot of anti-station missions which pays some very good money.</div>

			<div class="content">Hey, I just thought of something!
<br />
<br />Freelancer is more RPG-ish, right? Why not make levels based not on credits, but on the over-used, cliche-ed <i>experience points </i>?
<br />
<br />But the problem is that this makes it so that you must fight to gain levels, so maybe earning credits also earns you experience points, but not very quickly.
<br />
<br />(Of course, I don't know how one can possibly mod this, if it's even possible (which I doubt))
<br />
<br />Why make your own mistakes when someone else has already made them for you?

<br />
<br />I agree with the sentiments about money being used as a way to  lvl up. But even so, most players who can find a way to get a falcon can easy take on the omicron systems for some 100k or more missions - spending an hour doing some of those missions (or even some higher money ones) can net you well over a million bucks easily.</div>

			<div class="content">The key with the system I suggested is that it would be possible to tweak the speed of progression.  How much money you make on missions wouldn't matter: the formula for levels would be based on the amount of missions completed AND the difficulty rating for each mission.  This formula could be altered to slow things down more, as it wouldn't be completely dependant on funds.
<br />
<br />But there would be no point in doing any of this if there were no level requirements for equipment.  You're right, Ranpostgen, it gets pretty easy to make money on higher missions.  And tweaks would have to be made for the difficulty rating to mean much (you can complete difficulty 48 &quot;kill the base&quot; missions in a few minutes, if they dont' tell you to kill all ships as well.  Missions with only a single target should have a significantly lower diff rating)
<br />
<br />But, if the formula says you need to do a load of higher difficulty missions to progress a level, AND there are level requirements for better equipment, it wouldn't matter how filthy rich you were.  You'd still have to work to be able to get better stuff.  That's how &quot;exp&quot; traditionally works.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;you would still have to take the time to pick a side and do missions in order to advance levels and gain access to better equipment and ships, restoring the natural progression from SP.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Which would absolutely <i>suck </i> for anyone who wants to play as a pure trader. I think the key to getting a &quot;must complete missions&quot; plan to improve the pacing of the game without decreasing the style options available to players would be to significantly broaden the range of mission types available. And we're not just talking about adding trading missions here, btw. We'd need mining missions, exploration missions, etc. Of course such missions should impact your faction ratings as much as a kill'em'all mission for the same faction.</div>
