<br />
<br />                                             <b>21 A.D. </b>
<br />
<br />     It was so hard for Joash to get up some mornings. His mother had just called to him that his father expected him out in the fields before the second hour. He sat up blinking his eyes open. There was too little light coming from the oil lamp his mother left in the nook in the wall. There were days he wished he had a window in his room. It would let in the morning light and he could see the stars at night.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Joash !!&#8221; His father called out, &#8220;Come on boy and get with it, the harvest starts today&#8221; his voice softening at the end. Caleb never could get angry at his son, even when he tended to get a little lazy. After all, he was sixteen and a man for the last three years. Still, he knew the boy still needed guidance so that he would be able to survive on his own. 
<br />
<br />Israel was still a harsh and dry land away from the Jordan river. It took a lot of work to get grain from the land and a lot of prayer for G_ds mercy on them. 
<br />
<br />Their little village was about two days walk from Jerusalem towards the great sea. Joash saw it once when his father took him to pick up some new seed that had just been brought up from Egypt by way of the sea. The boats came in at Joppa, but some merchants brought some down the coast a bit to sell to those who traveled less. The first of the gentle waves scared him a little when his father set him down in the water. But, like all children, he quickly over came his fear and played, splashing and jumping as the next wave pushed him to the shore. 
<br />
<br />Joash thought back on those days as he put his sandals on and grabbed his cloak. His staff was beside the front door. &#8220;You had better hurry Joash, you know how father worries about getting all the wheat harvested before any thieves try to steal it&#8221; his mother said as she handed him a few figs and a skin of water to carry. &#8220;Hurry on now&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />		     Joash was still getting the hang of the sickle that cut the wheat. It sometimes gave him blisters until his mother gave him strips of cloth to wrap his hands in. &quot;This&quot; he thought, &quot;is the easy part, gathering the sheaves in bundles was harder&quot;. He still needed practice tying the bundles with a sheath or two of the wheat. He looked up at the low rolling hill that overlooked their house. To him, it seemed to stretch for a great distance, in reality, it was only a quarter of a Sabbath&#8217;s day walk. It seemed that it hardly ever rained here. But G_d always provided enough for the grains to grow.
<br />
<br />     Joash wondered were his brother was. Judah was just six, but he was beginning to learn to work the animals around the house. He also tended the small garden out back that provided the family with additional food so they would not starve waiting for the harvest. Judah was like a lot of younger brothers, a pain in the neck some days, and a friend the next. 
<br />
<br />     Judah was just coming out of the sheep pen with about fifteen sheep and the dog. That was about all he could handle at six years old. The dog was well trained and could easily keep this group together. Judah had a small shepard&#8217;s&#8217;s&#8217;s staff that his mother had bought for him. He would take these sheep just over the rise to the left of where his father and Joash were harvesting. They would be able to feed on some of the left over grain. His father had told him that the sheep needed to be fattened up a bit to sell at the temple market for sacrifice. These sheep were without spot or blemish according to the Torah. So, he knew that the grain the ate would make them fatter and they could make more money.
<br />
<br />     Joash was just finishing tying up his tenth bundle when his father walked up. Joash looked up at the sun and figured it was about noon. &#8220;Let me have the water skin, Joash&#8221; his father said as he approached. Caleb was trying to figure how long it would take to harvest all the grain. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the cart up here this afternoon to take th bundles in for safekeeping&#8221; he told Joash. &#8220;If we cut and bundle all the way to sundown for the next three days, we should have all of it in.&#8221;
<br />
<br />     &#8220;What about the soldiers, father, what if they come here this year&#8221; Joash asked with a bit of fear in his voice. He knew the soldiers were ruthless and took what they wanted, killing those who would not give it to them.   
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />     Caleb hid is concern when he answered his son, &#8220;we will have to put our trust in Elohem that we can get it done in time&#8221;.
<br />
<br />     Judah always was a little bit scared taking the sheep out alone. The dog would bark if someone came, but would not be able to fight any one off and keep track of the sheep. &#8220;G_d, please watch over me as I watch over my fathers sheep, and keep me and them safe, Amen&#8221; Judah prayed as he led the sheep on down the slope. He had a strange feeling that he was completely safe. 
<br />
<br />     After about an hour, Judah realized he had walked farther than he had intended and began to turn the sheep back the way he came. 
<br />
<br />     Ezra and his five bandit friends lay down in the grass so the boy would not see them. They had seen him coming for half an hour and were waiting for him to get near so they could steal the sheep. They would fetch a lot at the market. Ezra was about to rise to rush the boy when Seba grabbed his hand and pulled him back down. &#8220;What is it, I was about to take the boy and the sheep, what&#8217;s wrong Seba&#8221; Ezra asked with frustration in his voice. &#8220; We better let this one go Ezra&#8221; Seba answered. &#8220;Why would I let so easy a target get away&#8221; Ezra replied. Pointing back to the boy Seba whispered, &#8220;because of that big man with the drawn sword walking with the boy, that&#8217;s why&#8221;. Ezra raised up a little to see where Seba was pointing. Then he saw the man. He was a giant, about two cubits taller than Ezra and he had a long sword rather than the short blades the Romans carried. The man looked like he knew how to use it too. &#8220; Alright, we wait for another one and let this one go&#8221; Ezra felt a pit in his stomach. He knew he could fight a little, but he usually hoped the numbers alone would intimidate the victim rather than having to fight.
<br />
<br />    Judah felt peace as he turned the sheep back to the farm. It felt like someone was walking with him, protecting him, watching over him. He knew it was only him, the dog and fifteen sheep, but just the same, he smiled at the possibility.  
<br />
<br />     Devorah went up on the roof of the house to sort thru the flax that had been drying since the twenty sixth of the month Adar. After checking the different areas on the roof, she saw that it was all dry and ready. She took a sharp knife and began to cut the roots off and to stack the stems off to the side. The roots, she would use to help start the cooking fires. The Egyptian trader would be stopping by the village near the end of the week and she needed to have the flax prepared and ready to go. He would be taking it to a weaver near Egypt to turn into linen. The trader often gave a fair price due to what he knew he could get for the linen in Joppa and in Tyre. 
<br />
<br />     It was getting late in the afternoon when Joash stopped to get a drink of water from the skin. Caleb saw him stopped and came over to where he was. &#8220;Let me have one of the figs your mother gave you this morning&#8221; Caleb asked as he sat down beside Joash. Joash gave him the cloth wrapped figs to his father as he took a second long drink of water. &#8220;Son, it looks like we might just get it all in, in another two days&#8221; Caleb said. Both were tired from being bent over all day. Both were dusty and weary but they knew that could do it. 
<br />
<br />     Judah let the sheep graze for about three hours before turning them to home. He had to get them into the village to the community well so he could get them watered and home before dark. They had eaten a lot and needed the water now. The dog ran down a stray and brought it back to the herd and kept the others in line. They all followed Judah and knew his voice when he called them.  Judah was hungry as well, even though he had eaten the figs his mother had sent with him. He could hardly wait to get home.</div>

			<div class="content">corsair, to keep with the period of the story, this is the way people talked. Thats why its put this way. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />To Continue-
<br />
<br />     Judah let the sheep graze for about three hours before turning them to home. He had to get them into the village to the community well so he could get them watered and home before dark. They had eaten a lot and needed the water now. The dog ran down a stray and brought it back to the herd and kept the others in line. They all followed Judah and knew his voice when he called them.  Judah was hungry as well, even though he had eaten the figs his mother had sent with him. He could hardly wait to get home. 
<br />
<br />     Rachel and Rina, Devorah&#8217;s sisters, had come to the house to drop off some salted fish they had picked in Capernaum from a fish market. They also bought some smoked fish as well. Rachel and Rina both were younger than Devorah, but were just as close to her as any sisters could be. They lived in a village two hours walk to the north of Devorah&#8217;s. Both were married, Rachel to a metal smith and Rina to a carpenter. Both had no children yet, though they both wanted large families like all women did. They had traveled as far as Nazareth so that Rina&#8217;s husband could learn from a carpenter there and bring the skills back home with him. The carpenter in Nazareth had a son working with him by the name of Yeshua ben-Joseph. He was very good in his own right and was a very capable carpenter as well. The women had also noticed a peace about him as well. 
<br />
<br />     Judah arrived at the trough just as another shepard&#8217;s was leaving. The other smiled as he saw Judah bringing his fifteen sheep to be watered. He thought to himself of his earlier days as well. Judah laid his staff aside and picked up the bucket that was tied to a rope and dropped it into the well and pulled with all his might to bring the bucket back up. It took him about an hour to draw the water it took to satisfy all the sheep. Judah knew he would sleep good that night. He also knew the sheep would stay in the next two days and eat straw, rather than go out into the fields. He would work in the vegetable garden instead. &#8220;Well,&#8221; Judah sighed, &#8220;I better get you home before mother begins to worry, lets go dog.&#8221; The dog rose from his resting spot and began to round the small group up and Judah called the name of the oldest sheep and it began to follow him. 
<br />
<br />     Caleb had the cart up on the rise near the bundles at about two hours before sundown. He and Joash loaded it full of the tied bundles they gathered earlier. They started for the house when Caleb noticed dust rising in the west. &#8220;Take the cart on home Joash&#8221; Caleb ordered. Joash was too tired to ask what was wrong. He looked back at his father when he reached the bottom of the hill and watched as he disappeared over the rise. 
<br />
<br />     Caleb did not want Joash concerned nor to draw the soldiers attention to them as they rode by. &#8220;They must be headed for Jerusalem&#8221; Caleb thought. There were about thirty of  them, one looking like a Tribune. They rode hard so it was a good thing they did not see the cart or they may have stopped. Caleb knew of friends who had run ins with the Romans and died for it. He did not want to put his family in any danger, so he did his best to present as little of a target as possible. 
<br />
<br />     Devorah saw Joash bring the cart to the side of the house near the steps that lead to the roof. &#8220;Where is your father, Joash&#8221; she asked when she noticed Caleb was not with him. &#8220;He stayed on the hill a little longer, but I think he should be along in a bit&#8221; he replied, his voice a little shaky. He knew that the only reason his father would have remained was if soldiers were coming near. He did not want his mother to worry though. He leapt off the cart onto the steps and began to carry the grain onto the roof to store. They would take it to the threshing floor on the west side of the village when the harvest was finished. He also knew he and his father would share the time staying with it until the threshing was complete. Then they could sell part of the harvest and have money to live on till the next harvest. 
<br />
<br />     Just before sunset, Judah prodded the last of the sheep into the pen on the side of the house and closed the gate. He walked up the stairs to the roof where his brother and mother were and sat down. &#8220;Am I tired&#8221;Judah said wearily, &#8220;what&#8217;s that smell&#8221; he added and sat up right. He knew his mother would never leave the cooking unattended as it would burn. &#8220;Rachel and Rina are here and were having some of the fish they brought back with them from Capernaum and some beans&#8221; Devorah answered her son. Judah knew his aunts would be staying the night then as it was unsafe to travel after dark. 
<br />   
<br />    Caleb came in the house after dark, Devorah looking up from the table with a questioning look. He just shook his head and she went back to setting out the food. Caleb smiled when he notice the other women there. He knew the would help provide a distraction for his family tonight so they would not worry. He washed up and lit two more lamps and set them in nooks on the opposite wall of the table. He could smell the fish and was ready for the meal. They did not get fish but a couple times a year due to the distance to get it and the fact that it would not store well, even the dried fish did not keep well in the heat. 
<br />
<br />     Devorah sat beside Caleb on the roof looking at the stars. It was so peaceful sitting there, so quiet. &#8220;Was it soldiers out there today&#8221; she asked softly. &#8220;Yes, about thirty of them in a big hurry to get to Jerusalem&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The garrison there must be in need of more soldiers what with the zealots boldly attacking them when they patrol&#8221; he added. Devorah thought about all that the rabbi taught them in the synagogue, about the Messiah who would one day come and deliver them from the Romans. But Devorah thought back to the scriptures that he taught and wondered. She was glad that the Sabbath would be here tomorrow evening. She looked forward to it since she could remember. Her mother taught her that. Shabbat meant that they could learn more and more about Jehovah and His will for them. She secretly hoped Joash would be called on to read from the Torah soon. It was a sign of blessing to be called on to read. 
<br />
<br />     Judah lay awake when he knew he should be sleeping. He was thinking about the feelings he had out in the field. He knew he was alone, but it was an overwhelming feeling of someone walking beside him when he turned the sheep around. &#8220;Thanks G_d, thanks for protecting me today&#8221; he said, eyes slowly closing. Judah drifted off to sleep, a shadow reflecting off the wall from the lamp, as if someone was standing there in the room.  
<br />
<br />
<br />     Joash was getting ready for sleep. He had a lamp sitting on a small box near his pallet. The flickering light casting shadows on the ceiling that he wished were stars. There were days in the fall and spring when his mother would let him sleep on the roof under the stars. He loved laying there,

<br />
<br />To continue- 
<br />
<br />     Joash was getting ready for sleep. He had a lamp sitting on a small box near his pallet. The flickering light casting shadows on the ceiling that he wished were stars. There were days in the fall and spring when his mother would let him sleep on the roof under the stars. He loved laying there, seeing all the stars and the moon when it was full. He dreamed of one day seeing them from a different place. To see if they changed much. He knew there were those who could tell the seasons by the stars, but, he just like to enjoy the beauty of them as they were. He remembered hearing of a star, that before he was born, shone like the full moon for two years. It was said that it was a sign for the birth of Messiah into this world. Joash did not know. He wanted to learn more from the scriptures, but as a farmer, he had little time to learn. Slowly, as always, sleep came when we do not expect it. Devorah came in and saw her son asleep and reached for the lamp, extinguishing the flame and setting it in the nook.
<br />
<br />          Jehoiada was getting things ready for the Sabbath. Even as the sun was setting on the day before, he always looked forward to celebrating the Sabbath. It stirred his heart and kindled a fire that the world could not put out. Jehoiada had been the rabbi in the village for just over three years. He had studied under Abihu for many years and had an open heart. Abihu had cautioned him not to trust all oral teaching, without searching the scrolls to see if it were so. Jehoiada did this sometimes, but not always lately. The Roman occupation troubled him and he began to listen to those who wanted to drive out the Romans by force. It made sense sometimes then, when there was talk of Messiah coming to drive the invaders out. Jehoiada knew what was written, but, he still hoped for the former. And, it sometimes showed in his teaching of the people. He had received a warning from a visiting priest from Jerusalem, not to stray. He repented to the priest and offered a sin offering in Jerusalem for it, but the thought still troubled him.
<br />
<br />     The sunrise came all too soon. Joash was up this time with the first call from his mother. He knew today he would have to work faster so that they could make up for stopping early and cleaning up and preparing for the Sabbath. He grabbed the skin of water and the package of figs and hurried out to the field to start cutting the wheat. He remembered the cloth strips this time and wrapped his hands on the way to where they had left off yesterday. Joash looked up as he reached the place he left the sickle. and saw the clouds coming in. He hoped they would bring rain. He knew the garden needed it and it would make it easier for Judah not to have to draw so much water for the vegetables. Even though the brothers seemed to antagonize each other some days, most of the time they got along and even managed to care about each other as well. That was because of their mothers teaching of Torah to them, that an a firm hand. 
<br />
<br />    &#8220;Come on sleepy head&#8221; his mother called to him. Judah was still tired after the work yesterday. His eyes were slow to open. &#8220;Today will be easier for you&#8221; she continued, &#8220;You can work in the garden this morning and then give me a hand with the Shabbat dinner in the afternoon&#8221;. &#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m coming&#8221; he replied. He rolled up his pallet and put it on the shelf. After eating some bread and a few figs, he headed out to the garden out back. 
<br />
<br />     The weeds were trying to grow amongst the melons. The fig trees were loaded with fruit. The grape vines on the outside rows were heavy laden and would need a lot of water. Caleb had dug trenches between the rows for water to flow. After building the water wheel, it was easier to water the garden. Judah could open the gates of individual rows so some row could have more than others as they needed it. The cucumbers would need more than the beans. The onions would need only a small amount. Most of the garden was filled with beans, as they were easier to grow and produced well. Judah thought of the room that Caleb and Joash dug under the front area where the oxen were kept. They planked over it and it stayed a lot cooler than any where else. His mother kept the fruit and vegetables there so they would last longer. 
<br />
<br />     Devorah was still deciding what she wanted to fix for the meal. The flat bread was always there and she could fix a meat and vegetable mix to stuff the bread with. The lamb could be prepared quickly enough. And if she prepared the holding pit with the lined rocks after the coals were removed, the food could be kept warm for a day and prevent any work from being done on the Shabbat. She had the two lamps ready with the extra oil holders so the oil would not run out before the end of Shabbat. She nibbled on some figs and almonds while she decided what to fix. She had plenty of spices from Egypt and could flavor the meal in several ways. &#8220;Ok, I&#8217;ll prepare the lamb, with onions and lentils and spice&#8221; Devorah thought to herself. She headed out to the pen to select a lamb.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />     Joash was so very tired. It was a little after noon. He had stopped for a long drink of water to quench his thirst. He wiped the sweat from his brow as he looked at the bundles that he and his father had gathered. The work was nearly done. But, the last part would have to wait until after the Sabbath. There would be no way for them to get what they had cut back to the house and do more before the Shabbat began. And they would have to clean up before sundown. 
<br />
<br />     Caleb was as tired as his son was. He looked up as Joash started back to work. When he looked his way, Caleb pointed to the cart to indicate that they would start loading up. After getting it back, they would have three quarters of the harvest done. He would have to trust Elohem that they can get the rest done after the Sabbath is over. He Prayed the bandits and the Romans would stay away from the fields. 
<br />
<br />    Rachel and Rina were back home just after noon. The servants that traveled with them went on to the houses they worked at. Their masters were good friends with Caleb&#8217;s family and helped when ever they could. All knew traveling the roads alone was dangerous and exceptionally for women. The two knew this and always sought out other travelers when they needed to travel. Their husbands would be back latter today. Rina&#8217;s husband, Ahaz had learned a lot of tips he could use in starting a business in the village that they lived. There was no carpenter there and they had to travel to other villages to have wheels and other things repaired. But now they wouldn&#8217;t. Rachel&#8217;s husband, Salmon, was a metal smith and could find work any where. Plow shears, hoes, axes all needed sharpening and repairing. Both would provide a good income, weather in coin or in food, they would be paid. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to batter service as well. 
<br />
<br />     Jehoiada had selected the scroll to be read from. He still had to decide the reader. He had read the section in advance so he could prepare to expound on it. He prayed Jehovah would give insight and wisdom to him. He knew that his views were not particularly desired by the village. Most were conservative and follow the scriptures in trust of G_d and His will. Joram, who was helping out in the synagogue, had filled the lamps with oil so they would burn through the Sabbath until first day. He never realized how much oil it took to fill all the lamps so that the whole was lit at any hour and none would need lighting after the Sabbath started. That was one thing he had learned well over the years. He still remembered the stinging rebuke he received in his younger days from that Rabbi. The one from his on village he grew up in. He was told as he was lashed, that G_d required that all rest on the Sabbath. He did hear talk of those that believed that G_d created the Sabbath for man and not man for the Sabbath. After all, he and others still had to water any farm animals they had. But he has went with the majority of the people. He just wanted in his heart, to follow G_d in His will and please Elohem. 
<br />
<br />Judah came wandering in, tired and weary.  &#8220;Mother, all the garden is watered and I picked some vegetables for you&#8221;. Devorah smiled at her son. Though he was young, he worked hard. He was learning to do many things at his age, that he will do well when he is older. &#8220;Put them by the cooking area and get cleaned up, Shabbat will be starting soon&#8221;. 0k, I will&#8221; he replied. 
<br />
<br />After putting the vegetables on the table by the fire, Judah went back outside to where his mother had set the water pitcher so he could wash up. He poured a little into a small bowl and started washing his face and then his hands. He sat down and washed his feet. Oh the cool water felt so good on his feet, so wonderful. So refreshing to the soul. Judah looked forward to the meal that evening, as he was extra hungry. The figs did not hold him over as they usually did. 
<br />
<br />About that time Caleb and Joash were coming up to the storage are of the house. They looked so dusty and tired to Judah, but he went over to help un load the wagon with them. &#8220;Judah, your already cleaned up,&#8221; Caleb said, &#8220;Your brother and I will get the cart unloaded&#8221;. &#8220;But&#8221; Judah said, &#8220;I just want to help&#8221;. &#8220;Another time, son, another time&#8221; Caleb replied. He and Joash made quick work of the load and after putting away the ox and watering and feeding it, they washed up too. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s time&#8221; Devorah called out. The sun was near setting and she had the lamps ready to light. She knew the ritual and lit the two lamps and began her prayers.</div>
