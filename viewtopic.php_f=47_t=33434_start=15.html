<br />&quot;If i could trouble you, would u help us with something?&quot;&quot;What?&quot;&quot;The hackers have closed a deal with us a few minutes ago, they want cardamine,food and water. We sent transports already but there this small portion left. Your Mule is capable of transporting that, the junker commander is willing to pay 100000 credits cos no one else wants to take it.&quot; &quot; Okay,Ill do it, where is it&quot;&quot;Mactan Base and some guys are tagging along, a hacker escort will also greet your convoy at the jumphole which u know where it is.&quot;&quot; and keep your eyes open....

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Planet Los Angeles/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />This was not an ideal day by any means.  In a span of days, the entire region's confidence had been shot to tell.  First, Queen Carina unexpectedly died.  Now this new guy, King Wessex, felt the need to inflate his ego and push into the Cortez System.  Thankfully he let Orbital Spa and Cruise keep control over Planet Curacao, but he unilaterally declared the rest of the system to be under Bretonian rule.
<br />
<br />It made no sense.  Bretonia and Liberty had been in mutual understanding for centuries now.  There had rarely ever been conflict between natives of the two Houses, barring rivalries between criminal factions and whatnot.  And Captain Nathan Edwards of the Liberty Police had seen plenty of those.
<br />
<br />All Liberty Police and Liberty Navy units in the California System had been put on heightened alert.  For now though, the Bretonian Armed Forces were keeping on their side of the Jump Gate, and that was the only thing keeping Edwards reassured.  It didn't help though when he reminded himself that if the Bretonians did push into California, Planet Los Angeles and the Battleship Yukon would be the first things they'd encountered after punching through the new blockade lines.  Fortunately, President Jacobi was keeping a level head in the midst of all this madness.  She'd moved a detatchment of two battleships and six cruisers from the Liberty Navy to stand guard over the Jump Gate to the Cortez system.  And still, despite King Wessex's reckless actions, Jacobi had not given up complete hope on solving this situation diplomatically.
<br />
<br />Edwards wasn't a political genius, but any idiot could see that either this Wessex fellow was insane, or he was a puppet for someone even more insane.  Either way, the chances that cooler heads would prevail at the moment seemed pretty damn slim.
<br />
<br />Grimly, Edwards checked the chrono on his display.  1400 hours.  He reached over, keying the comm.  &quot;This is Liberty Police Blue 1-1.  Flight, check in.&quot;  The three other Patriots in his flight group did their standard reporting.  All green across the board.  No surprise there.  As LPI Blue Flight 1 was about halfway between San Diego Border Station and Los Angeles, Edwards couldn't help but wonder how far into Liberty King Wessex's thirst for dominance ran.  And who else would be caught in the crossfire.
<br />
<br />If anything good could be seen in the moment now, at least the pirates in the system had been quiet.

<br />Captain Fallon/Rhino Assault Freighter/Magellan Jump Hole/Rouges.

<br />The Rhino docked with the Clysedale with a lound THUNK. The armed Rouges rushed through, holding the two crew members at gunpoint.

<br />&quot;Where's the other one of you? I know ones injured, but we detected four lifeforms...&quot;

<br />Wondered why the boss ordered me to follow this guy? thought Halcyon dolefully.
<br />Halcyon radioded back for orders.

<br />&quot;Got it.&quot;
<br />
<br />Leon/Dagger/Magellan Jump Hole/Outcast

<br />Wonder whats taking the Rhino so long, he thought. He knew if there was loot, he'd get a share, and he was  saving up to buy a Wolfhound.

<br />&quot;Blackhawk sqaudron, move out! Lets get back to Montezuma.&quot;
<br />
<br />Hopefully the Bretonians didn't know the location of Montezuma. He was sure they would find it eventually, so he wanted his pay and to get out of there.

<br />
<br />The rouge boarding party held them at gun piont and asked again
<br />&quot;wheres the other guy?&quot;
<br />&quot;hes up front&quot; rich replied hoping that the secret agent (who im leaving oprn for antoer person) had had time to call for backup from one of the crusers now stationed in cortez.
<br />
<br />The pirates then round up the crew and were going to start looting the ship when a bretionan attack squad surronded the linked frieters the com sparked (litrely) to life
<br />&quot;this is bretoinian escort squad beta to rouge boarding party stand down&quot;
<br />&quot;I knew it was a trap&quot; the rouge leader said
<br />Richard spoke up ,as the uninjured negotator was frozen in shock,
<br />&quot;We came to offer a truce if we wanted you dead we would have demolished the base with crusers&quot;
<br />The rouge commander thought this over for some time before saying
<br />&quot;Ok we'll lead you back&quot;
<br />&quot;im afraid we'll need towing, we don't have any cruse capabiltay&quot;
<br />&quot;Fine on one condition&quot;The rough captin said thougtfuly&quot;your escort don't follow&quot;
<br />&quot;Right ill radio the message&quot; richard replied as he walked to the comm

<br />i'm working on my ship, look at it and try to get it working again. i must get out off here before the two houses are ready to make take over this system and will destroy almost everything in their patch... i must and will get my dragon ready before that day.... but how. the traders stay away from the small wargrounds with are already in use around. i saw them fighting while i was in the dagger outside, how do i get the needable parts for my dragon if the traders don't trade them anymore along the normal patches and in this system...
<br />
<br />tomorow i will try my luck further up in the stream, but it will be thougher also. i hope a squad off the lane hackers will help me with it. only with the dragon can i get the lane hackers parts  to my home in the far north systems. but still... it is a long way and need the luck i can find. maybe it is the best to strike out when liberty get the upper hand and strike to manchester...

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Magellan Jump Gate/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />If there was one thing Edwards had learned from war, it was never that it was black and white.  Thus was a perfect example with regard to Chief Constable Alistair Grey of the Bretonian Police Authority.  Edwards had known Grey for many years, and they were close personal friends, often sharing glasses of Liberty Ale or pints of Bretonian Lager on each other's respective home turfs.  He knew Grey was a level-headed, good man.  A clean cop.  So hard to come across uncorrupted officers sometimes, especially in the higher ranks.  Edwards was grateful he had a mirroring counterpart in Bretonia.
<br />
<br />After finishing his patrol with Blue Flight 1, Edwards contacted Grey, of course after routing his communications through several back-channels and intermediaries; he need some idea as to what the Bretonians were up to, what their mindset was.  He'd run his communique through Planet Los Angeles' comm network, through Planet Curacao, through Sheffield Station in the Manchester System, and finally to Kingston Border Station, resting on the Manchester/Cortez border.  Not the most direct route, he knew... but that was the plan.  Last thing he needed was some nosy paper-pusher in the Liberty Security Force checking his communiques to see if he was &quot;aiding the enemy.&quot;  Fortunately, Constable Grey had agreed to meet with Edwards.  The only hitch, if it could be classified as such, was that the Cortez System was already swarming with craft from the Bretonian Armed Forces.  Not the ideal place for a meeting.  The only other option available to them was the Magellan System.  They agreed to meet on Freeport 4, a neutral site.  Edwards had no qualms about that.  After loading his Patriot up with as many Seeker Mines, Countermeasures and Wasp Cruise Disruptor Missiles as it could hold, and mounting Justice Mk. IIIs on all four of his hardpoints, Edwards set out, first stopping by San Diego Border Station to drop off some documents his commander had wanted delivered, and then here he waited before the Magellan Jump Gate.  Another Liberty Navy detatchment of two battleships and six cruisers sat poised in position around the gate in case a Bretonian force tried to push its way through.  The biggest nuisance to this was that all controls of the Jump Gates to both Magellan and Cortez had been turned over to the orbiting battleships.  No ships, civilian or military, were allowed passage without being throughly scanned and having their papers double and triple checked.  Edwards had approached the Battleships <i>Nebraska </i> and <i>Kentucky </i> under the pretense of meeting a bounty hunter on Freeport 4.  A half-truth to be precise.
<br />
<br />It seemed like the Navy brats inside these ships were making him wait, just to piss him off, see how long it took til he commed them impatiently, demanding what the holdup was.  It was long-known fact that LPI and Navy officers often felt like haggling each other over who bagged the most bad guys.  Eventually, it seemed, they grew tired of stringing Edwards along.
<br />
<br />&quot;Liberty Police Blue 1-1, this is Battleship <i>Nebraska </i>.  You are clear for Jump Gate access.  Watch out for Bretonians out there.&quot;
<br />Edwards didn't even bother acknowledging the response.  He could hear a few Navy officers in the background remarking how foolish he must've been for taking something like a Patriot into contested space.  He didn't care.  All that mattered to him at the moment was making his meeting with Constable Grey at Freeport 4.  And it's all he thought about as his Patriot streaked into the active Magellan Jump Gate.</div>

			<div class="content">Leon/Wolfhound/Alcatraz/Outcasts
<br />
<br />Leon had already gone by the time the Bretonia Attack Force came. He was no coward, but he wasn't stupid either. He knew he couldnt fight that much.
<br />
<br />Back on Alcatraz, the Mission Commison gave him his 5k. Before he left, Leon went to the Ship Dealer to have one last look at the Wolfhound. His Dagger was much prettier, sure, but it just didn't have the firepower these days.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey again,&quot; said the dealer. &quot;I see your're back. I was looking for you anyway.&quot;
<br />&quot;Why's that?&quot;
<br />&quot;Well I know you want a Wolfhound, and havn't got the money.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yeah, and...&quot;
<br />&quot;Well, I got one in, its a bit damaged, and has no equipment, so I'll give it to you for 45k.&quot;
<br />
<br />Leon checked his virtual account. He had 51k!
<br />
<br />&quot;Thats no problem mate, I'll outfit it from my Dagger.&quot;
<br />&quot;Thats done then. Give me the keys to your craft, Ill transfer everything for you.
<br />
<br />2 hours later....
<br />
<br />The Bretonians are gonna take over this sector. Time to get out, thought Leon.
<br />Mactan Base is probably the best place....</div>

<br />
<br />i wake up... and take something to eat... i hope their isn't cardamine in the food and air around here... ah, well. maybe it's time to get myself and the dagger i still have ready...
<br />
<br />i walk past the dragon and toke a look... i hope the engine is the only prob... and walk toward the dagger with is parked a few meters further. i look at the ship, and make it ready for the traders hunting in the manchester system.
<br />
<br />i go to the bar after prepaired the ship. i go to the bartender and ask to him if their are any good pilots around with wanna help me with it. he said to me that it is a no go and that almost half bretonia warfleet is in manchester and cortez.
<br />
<br />so this mission was over before it even started and i'm still stuck here... i must find a way to contact kyoto base... to let them know what is happening around here, but how... and that i can't come back also, co'z the dragon has engine problems and the dagger is to small to take the cargo with it... i must look for an other way, but their isn't, or is their???
<br />
<br />i look around in the bar, and take myself a drink... i'm thinking; &quot;ah, they never had to sended me here, now i'm stuck between bretonia and liberty, do i ever come out off here??? even if i get an other ship, is it's hold great enough to hold the total cargo...&quot; the drink is nice.
<br />
<br />i'm at the weapon dealer and look around if he have something usefull. i founded a few usefull things and take that to the dragon, i worked a few hours on it before i think it's ready... now only a test run before i can go further...
<br />
<br />i asked if i may have a little squad to assist me in the test flight. they had a few avialable pilots for that. i started the engine and looks if everything works nice. it seems to works nice and trottle a littl up, this leaded to a reaction where the engines started to do strange... both engines exploded, i had time to exitted the ship before it burned away...
<br />&quot;<b>nooo </b>, my lovely dragon, not now....&quot; and thought i will be stuck on this base forever with the dagger...
<br />
<br />i take the rest off the day off... i'm a guest around here, a special guest, but i hate it here... ah, we need to think off an other plan to get the cargo away from here and to kyoto... and now i must let them know in kyoto what the deal is.
<br />
<br />maybe must join the hackers they would be happy with someone like me by their side... only i hate the cardamine parties they have a lot off times...</div>

<br />One: There were five ships escorting him to Mactan,two lane hackers who decided to come in advance and three junkers in their wolfhounds

<br />two: The guy who was trailling him was there

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Freeport 4/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />Edwards had felt like he'd walked right into a powder keg as soon as he'd crossed the threshold into the Magellan System.  Already, there was a long line of ships stretching from the California Jump Gate all the way back to the second Trade Lane Ring that ran along the path to Freeport 4.  It was obvious that everyone wanted to get the hell out of the Independent Systems.  He couldn't blame them.  He was going to have a hell of a time getting out of here though once he was done meeting with Grey.
<br />
<br />He'd been waiting in the bar on Freeport 4 now for about twenty minutes.  All the while nursing his half-pint of Bretonian Lager.  Thank goodness the Zoners who ran the base weren't discriminatory to either side's citizens, much less each side's drinks.   Taking another swig, he looked up at the list on a viewscreen for what seemed like the hundredth time, showing all docked ships within the station, identifications, classes.  Any more information than that was less-than-public knowledge.  He smirked lightly as a new entry appeared on the list:
<br />*BPA Bravo 1-1 / Cavalier*
<br />Constable Grey had arrived.
<br />
<br />Edwards guessed it had been about another four minutes before Grey entered the room, decked out in his BPA garb no less.  He couldn't blame him; Edwards was here in his LPI uniform too.  As soon as Grey had entered the room, the bartender and what few people were actually being served in the bar seemed to exchange nervous glances at seeing an officer from both BPA and LPI in the same room.  Only after they shook hands, ordered another round of drinks, and took a seat in a booth nearby did people's apprehension seem to bleed away.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well then,&quot; Grey said, smoothing out the chest of his red uniform, &quot;I haven't been here in ages.  They haven't changed a thing.&quot;
<br />&quot;Change can be dangerous,&quot; Edwards said, taking a sip off his lager.
<br />Grey looked at him with sympathetic eyes.  &quot;Indeed it can be.&quot;
<br />Edwards cut to the chase, bringing his voice down a level, leaning in.  &quot;Al, what the hell is going on over there?  I can understand your House is upset over losing Queen Carina.  Hell, I know we'd be upset if we lost President Jacobi.  But this King Wessex guy, what's his deal?&quot;
<br />&quot;I wish I could tell you,&quot; Grey answered.  &quot;I'll say this though: we're starting to act a little too much like Rheinland.&quot;
<br />Edwards knew what Grey had meant.  Back when Rheinland had all but declared war against all of Sirius, they'd grown power hungry, pushing deep into the heart of Kusari space, all the way to the Honshu System, he'd heard.  Thankfully, Rheinland eventually withdrew it's forces back to its own space, but had violated about fifteen treaties in the process of carrying out Chancellor Niemann's conquest.  And now Bretonia was following suit.  And it made no damn sense.
<br />&quot;What do you know about King Wessex?&quot; Edwards asked.
<br />Grey leaned back, taking a long swig of Liberty Ale no less.  &quot;He was formerly a Lord Governor, holding control over the Leeds System.  Apparently, since Carina had no children, no direct heir to her throne, the researchers at Cambridge rummages through the old records, found out that Wessex was her closest living blood relative.  He's a third cousin, twice removed, something.... bah.  Either way, he got the crown.  Now, unlike most sovereigns, Bretonian rulers just typically take up space, showing off the face of the House, making state decisions in corroboration with the Prime Minister.  Well... now the whole system has been shot to hell.  Wessex is one of those ultra-nationalists who think that <i>everything </i> should be under the reign of the Bretonian Empire.  Me frankly, I think he's just trying to appease his ego.&quot;
<br />&quot;Perhaps, but the problem is that people are going to get caught in the crossfire from his quest for domination.  I'm sure you're having a hell of a time keeping things in order in Manchester.&quot;
<br />Grey shrugged.  &quot;Most of my problems come from rowdy BAF officers who drink too much when they're not on duty.  Most of them are already moving out of the staging point near Kingston though.  They're all starting to set up shop in orbit over Curacao.  Even though Orbital Spa and Cruise is still running the planet, it's destroying business for them.  They're considering evacuating the planet completely and moving the guests to other locations.  Problem is, where would they go?  If they headed for California, all the BAF forces in that region would probably shoot them down rather than let them fall into the hands of the enemy.  And if they went towards Manchester-&quot;
<br />&quot;-it rubs a lot of people the wrong way in the other colonies.  I get the picture.  Question now is, what the hell do we do about it?  Can't the Bretonian Parliament impeach him or something?&quot; Edwards asked.
<br />&quot;I wish,&quot; Grey replied.  &quot;Thing is, Wessex is already starting the first steps of dissolving parliament.  Soon, he'll have all of Bretonia's military and police forces, not to mention industries, at his fingertips, there to satisfy his own personal whims.&quot;
<br />&quot;WHAT!?&quot;  A voice from the middle of the bar shouted.  Both men turned to see he was looking up at a news screen.  Bold letters played out across the bottom of the screen: BREAKING NEWS - PLANET CURACAO TO EVACUATE.  In tandem, Grey and Edwards looked down at the man who had blurted out indignation; he was wearing an Orbital Spa and Cruise outfit.  No wonder he was upset.
<br />And just as suddenly, Edwards got a thought.  He finished off his glass of lager and slid out of his booth.  Grey give him a confused look.  &quot;Where you going?&quot;
<br />Edwards turned to the constable.  &quot;Think.  The guests can't go either way along the trade lane.  What's the only other way out of the Cortez System?&quot;
<br />Grey seemed to think about that for a second, and his eyes suddenly matched Edwards' expression.  &quot;The Magellan Jump Hole.&quot;
<br />&quot;Exactly,&quot; Edwards answered, nodding as he started heading towards the hangar bays with Grey following close behind.  &quot;And if all those rich guests come out in a contested region such as Magellan, in <i>one </i> place, the criminal factions in this system are going to make a killing.&quot;
<br />&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Grey asked as they entered the hangar bay, each starting to divert off towards their fighters.
<br />&quot;Our best chance is to escort them here to Freeport 4.  From here they can offload and go to either side without worrying about being shot at by any military or police.&quot;
<br />&quot;Let's just hope we don't get caught,&quot; Grey called as he entered his Cavalier and started powering up systems.  As Edwards entered his Patriot and started his fighter, he hoped the same thing as Grey.  So much so, he was repeating it in his head over and over as their police fighters streaked away from Freeport 4 towards the Cortez Jump Hole.</div>

<br />
<br />Leon had raided a cargo ship travelling through Magellan, so when he got to Mactan he decided to fully outfit his ship. He even gave it a name, The Katana.
<br />Bit poetic, he thought wryly.
<br />
<br />Anyway, next job. He walked into the bar to see, strangely, a man in a Blood Dragon uniform. Very weird. Going up to his table, he asked,
<br />
<br />&quot;Got anything for me?....&quot;</div>
