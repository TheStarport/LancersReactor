			<div class="content">Sorry about the wait, but here's chapter 6.
<br />
<br />Chapter 6
<br />
<br />	Deckard sat in silence trying to contain the uneasiness that was beginning to grow inside of him. Here he was sitting across from two representatives of one of the most feared terrorist groups in all of Sirius, and they wanted the damn case too. How crazy is this going to get? he thought to himself.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I see from your reaction that you are familiar with the Order, or at least you think you are,&quot; Rianna said. &quot;I assure you that not everything you have heard about us is true, and I think you'll come to realize that we are not who you think we are.  Why don't you relax and have a drink on us.&quot; She motioned to the bartender, who came over to their table. He leaned over as she whispered something to him. He looked at Deckard for a moment, then returned to the bar. He came back several minutes later with three mugs of Rheinland Lager. Deckard stared at the mug for a moment. Rianna Blair watched his reaction with an amused look on her face.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Relax, Mr. Deckard, it's only a drink. We haven't poisoned it.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard stared at her for a moment, then picked up the mug and took a long pull at it.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Now then,&quot; Rianna continued, &quot;to business. As I mentioned before, we are very interested in the contents of that case you're carrying.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You know,&quot; Deckard interrupted, &quot;you're the third person today who has 'expressed interest' in this damn thing. What the hell is in the case that's so important?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We don't know exactly, but we have a pretty good idea of what it might be.&quot; Rianna handed a vid-pad to Deckard. &quot;This video footage was smuggled out of a top-secret laboratory in Liberty space. It makes for interesting viewing.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard watched as the video began to play. The picture was somewhat grainy, but he could make out most of the details. He watched as an unconscious man was wheeled on a gurney into a darkened room. The video seemed to skip a bit, and Deckard realized it had been edited. A medical robot pressed a hypo-injector to the man's neck and administered some kind of drug into the man, who began to sweat profusely. The video skipped again, and Deckard watched in horror as the man began to convulse violently. Blood began to ooze out of the man's skin. The video skipped again and showed the man, now dead, lying in a pool of blood, hardly recognizable, as it appeared the man's skin had literally melted off of his body. Deckard, who had seen men die many times, was doing his best not to vomit at the horrid sight. Rianna watched him intently, gauging his reaction.
<br />
<br />	&quot;As you can see, the video was edited heavily, but you can see the time stamp on it. It took nearly an hour for this man to die an excruciatingly painful death.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What in God's name does that to a person?&quot; Deckard asked in a low whisper, still disturbed from what he had just seen.
<br />
<br />	&quot;The man in the video was an Outcast,&quot; Rianna answered, &quot;and was unlucky enough to be a guinea pig in a very unpleasant experiment. Are you familiar with Project Red Flag?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I thought not. Red Flag is a top-secret division of the Liberty military. So top-secret, in fact, that most of the high-level officials in Liberty government are unaware of its existence. In fact, it's believed that even President Jacobi is unaware about many of its operations.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, that's comforting and all,&quot; Deckard said, &quot;but what's that got to do with the case?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Red Flag's primary purpose when it was created was to defend Liberty from large-scale sabotage, terrorism, espionage, and so on. Kind of like a top-secret version of the LSF. However, it would seem that Red Flag has become so powerful that their top operatives believe they can operate above and beyond the bounds of Liberty government regulation. Which leads us to that case of yours.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We believe that the contents of the case are some kind of biological or genetic agent created by Red Flag to specifically affect the altered genetic structure of the Outcasts, while leaving those with no genetic alterations unaffected. The agent attacks the cells at a genetic level and destroys them from within. Once the cellular integrity of the victim has been compromised, it's only a matter of time before the victim succumbs to a very painful death.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So this Red Flag has created something to kill all the Outcasts. This is a bad thing? I personally don't have a problem killing Outcasts, especially if there's a million credits in it for me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Outcasts are still human, Mr. Deckard, misguided as they are. I would think that the thought of the possibility of killing millions would be enough to convince you. Apparently I was wrong, but maybe some further explanation will change your mind. We believe that this agent has an unintended side effect that Red Flag did not take into account. As you may be aware, cardamine alters the genetic structure of those who use it. Even just one use is enough to alter genetic code. If what we believe is correct, then whatever Red Flag has created will not only kill Outcasts, but also has the potential to kill anyone else who has taken a hit of cardamine. You, Mr. Deckard, could be carrying the means to destroy millions, if not billions, of people throughout the Sirius Sector, many of those innocent people whose only crime was that they tried cardamine once in their lives. In short, whether knowingly or unknowingly, you have become a party to genocide, not only to the Outcasts, but possibly many more innocent people throughout the colonies. Do you want that on your hands?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard sat back and looked at Rianna. It was a long time before he spoke.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Look, despite what you think, I don't want to see innocent people die. But what if you're wrong? This delivery is a pretty big payday for me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Believe me, we want to be wrong. All I'm asking is that you come with us to a safe place where we can test the contents of the case. If we're wrong, we'll send you on your way with our apologies. If we're right, then it is imperative we do not let this case go to Malta, or anywhere else for that matter.&quot; Rianna paused for a moment. &quot;This is important, Mr. Deckard, and we need your cooperation.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Let me get this straight, just so I have a great story to tell my friends. You're telling me that you believe Samuel Maddox gave me this case so I could be the destroying angel of the Outcasts and maybe a few million others?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;That's more or less right, but with one minor change.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And what's that?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It wasn't Samuel Maddox who gave you the case.&quot;
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">Here's chapter 7, if you're interested.
<br />
<br />Chapter 7
<br />
<br />	Deckard was silent for a moment.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Tell me this is a joke.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I wish it was, Mr. Deckard, but I can assure you that the man who hired you was not Samuel Maddox. He hasn't left Liberty space for quite some time.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How do you know?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Since the incident with Rheinland a year ago, all top Liberty officials have been asked to have a locator beacon implanted into their body. It's a very small chip that can be hypo-injected under the skin, and constantly transmits the location of the individual carrying the chip. Maddox had one implanted shortly after the incident. We've checked his implant records and he has not left Liberty in nearly three weeks. In fact, he has not left Manhattan in all that time.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How soon did you know this? Couldn't you have warned me in advance?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We did not know who had hired you until you told our agent on Freeport 2.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What? Who are you...Do you mean that Zane woman from the LSF?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Rianna smiled and nodded.
<br />
<br />	&quot;She contacted Order High Command and reported her findings after you left. We were then dispatched to find you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And here I am,&quot; Deckard said bitterly. &quot;So what do I do now?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You come with us and let us find out what you're carrying there. As you have already noticed, you have become part of this conspiracy whether you want to be or not, and your life is now in danger. We can help you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It looks like I have little choice now, doesn't it? I guess I'm in.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good. Meet us in space in half an hour. Mr. Nelson and I have some loose ends to tie up before we leave. We'll see you soon.&quot; The two Order agents stood up and left, leaving Deckard alone with his thoughts and his drink.
<br />
<br />	---------------
<br />
<br />	&quot;So where are we headed?&quot; Deckard asked as he and the two Order agents flew their spacecraft toward the trade lane.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sigma-13,&quot; replied Rianna. &quot;We have a ship standing by to rendezvous with us. It's the safest place right now.&quot;
<br />
<br />	After an uneventful trip through the jump gate the thre ships emerged into the swirling blue gases of the Crow Nebula. Deckard, who had never been to any of the Sigma systems, was taken aback by the beauty of the scenery.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wow,&quot; he said to himself.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm uploading a waypoint into your nav system,&quot; Rianna said. &quot;It's deep in the nebula, away from prying eyes. Just follow us.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard entered formation and followed the two Order ships as they flew deeper and deeper into the dust and gas. After what seemed like an eternity a radio call from Rianna broke the silence.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Osiris, this is Lambda wing requesting docking clearance.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Lambda wing, you are cleared for docking.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard watched with awe as a large capital ship appeared from seemingly out of nowhere.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Go ahead and land, Mr. Deckard. We'll meet you on deck.&quot;
<br />
<br />	-------------
<br />
<br />	Deckard had seen a lot during his time as a freelancer, but nothing prepared him for the awesome spectacle that was the Osiris. The battleship was a high water mark of technology, integrating the best technological advancements of all the houses into a harmonious blend of power and functionality. The hangar deck was filled with at least a dozen of the odd fighters that had escorted him here, and Deckard began to wonder if they flew as good as they looked. 	
<br />
<br />	&quot;So what do you think?&quot; asked a voice behind him. He turned around to see Rianna Blair walking toward him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;There aren't too many things that impress me anymore, but this is one of them. How did you do all this?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Order is made up of people from all over Sirius. Some of the best and brightest minds of the colonies have joined us, not to mention some of the best pilots.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;But what makes people want to join what everyone thinks is a terrorist group?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Once people know what our real intent is, it's not hard to recruit new members. The Order was created as a deterrent to outside forces that threaten Sirius and its population. Sometimes we have had to resort to...unconventional methods to achieve our goals, but as a wise man once said, 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.'&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And what do you mean by 'outside forces?'&quot; Deckard wanted to know.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm not cleared to give you that information as it is highly classified. Perhaps you will find out at some future time, but as for now, just know that there's more happening in and around Sirius than you will ever know. Ah, it's time to meet the boss.&quot;
<br />
<br />	A tall dark-skinned man with a shaven head approached them, walking with a swagger that seemed to convey an attitude not of superiority but sheer determination.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You must be Mr. Deckard. My name is Casper Orillion,&quot; he said and offered his hand. Deckard shook it in utter disbelief. Here, standing in front of him, was one of the most wanted men in all of Sirius, talking to him as if they were discussing the weather.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I understand you have something of interest to us. May I see it?&quot; Orillion asked. Deckard, still in a state of shock, handed over the case without hesitation.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Don't worry, Mr. Deckard, we will handle this with the greatest of care.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; a young man interrupted as he approached.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, Lieutenant?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Priority dispatch on the coded frequency.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Thank you, Lieutenant. Dismissed.&quot; Orillion read over the data pad and a scowl spread slowly over his face.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Damn,&quot; he said, &quot;we have a more serious problem here. Mr. Deckard, I suggest you take advantage of our hospitality and enjoy our well-stocked bar. We will let you know when we are finished. Captain Blair, Captain Nelson, please come with me.&quot; The three Order agents walked away, leaving Deckard alone and confused as he went to find the Osiris bar.
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">Because I'm in a generous mood today, here's chapter 8.
<br />
<br />Chapter 8
<br />
<br />	The bar was indeed, as Orillion had said, well-stocked. There was a wide selection of liquors from Kusari Sake, the ever-popular Sidewinder Fang from Bretonia, and the ever-boring Liberty Ale. One in particular caught Deckard's eye. The bartender said that it was a drink the Corsairs had invented, known simply as El Diablo. What the hell, Deckard thought to himself as he ordered the fiery-red looking drink.
<br />
<br />	He moved to an isolated table, sat down and observed his surroundings. He still didn't know what to make of the whole situation. Ever since the Order had become common knowledge throughout Sirius, Deckard had believed they were a dangerous threat to all of the colonies. Now that he was here fraternizing with them, he was even more confused. This was a group that obviously was not what they seemed, and he wondered if Rianna Blair's description of what they really did was accurate.
<br />
<br />	Deckard took a sip of his drink. Sure enough, El Diablo lived up to its name. It felt like liquid fire in his mouth, and he began to cough and sputter. The Osiris bartender looked over at Deckard's feeble attempts to stop the coughing and smiled. However, once the initial effects had passed, Deckard was able to savor the unique buzz the drink gave him. It was like nothing he had ever had before. He took another sip, and the effects were less drastic, since his taste buds had already taken the shock of the first swig and were slightly less functional.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I see you've discovered El Diablo,&quot; a female voice said. Deckard looked up to see Rianna Blair approaching.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good stuff,&quot; he replied in a somewhat raspier voice.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I personally don't touch the stuff,&quot; Rianna said, &quot;it's bad for flying. Anyway, we've run into a little snag, and we could use your help.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;A little snag? This have anything to do with my case?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, our scientists are still testing the contents. Don't worry, we'll be able to make it look like it was never tampered with. Anyway, we have a bigger problem to discuss. We received a coded dispatch from Liberty. It seems that the real Samuel Maddox has gone missing. His locator chip seems to have been disabled since Libery can't locate him.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So you want me to go look for him?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, we have our own agents doing that already. We want you to continue to Malta and deliver your package.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Are you saying you actually want me to deliver the death package to the Outcasts? Whatever happened to killing millions?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;If you'll let me finish,&quot; Rianna said testily, &quot;you will not be delivering the actual agent. You will be delivering a false agent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And what happens to me when the guy I deliver this to opens it up and finds out he's been had? I really have no desire to be shot right now.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Do you know who you are delivering the case to?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No,&quot; replied Deckard. &quot;The Maddox wanna-be mentioned in passing that I would be contacted when I landed. I assume arrangements were to be made from there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Since the case has mag-locks on it that are supposed to be tamper-proof,&quot; Rianna said with a slight smirk, &quot;I think it's safe to assume that your contact will consider the case as untampered with, and you will then leave without further ado.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;But the case will have been tampered with, right?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Let us deal with that. I think we're a little smarter than Red Flag. I will not deny, however, that this is dangerous. I wouldn't ask you to do it if it wasn't important. At the very least it will buy us extra time to figure out exactly what's happening.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard thought for a moment. &quot;One thing you need to understand,&quot; he said finally, &quot;is that I don't do anything dangerous unless there's a lot of money involved. If you want me, you gotta pay up.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We anticipated that. I can offer you fifty thousand credits for your help. In addition, you will have access to fly one of our Anubis fighter craft. Is this satisfactory?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard thought this one over. Fifty thousand credits was milk money, but the chance to fly that ship was one he could not pass up.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right,&quot; he finally said, &quot;I'll do it. However, if I decide it's getting too hot, I reserve the right to bug out, bring your ship back and get the hell out of your lives. Take it or leave it.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I think we can take that,&quot; Rianna replied. &quot;We'll let you know when we've finished with the case.&quot;
<br />
<br />	From out of seemingly nowhere, Casper Orillion appeared at the table.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I apologize for interrupting, but we have an even more serious problem.&quot; He handed a vid-pad to Deckard. &quot;Mr. Deckard, does this man look familiar to you?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard activated the vid-pad and watched. As far as he could tell, it looked like the landing pad on Los Angeles. His interest quickly turned to shock as he saw Samuel Maddox, or his doppelganger, handing over a case identical in appearance to the one he was carrying to an unknown pilot.
