			<div class="content">The Following is a Personal player posting about the below information, New Server and Mod which was just released. For Full APPROVED, server and mod information go visit the <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rrjds.com">www.rrjds.com</a><!-- w --> website.
<br />-------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />IT HAS ARRIVED !!!!!
<br />
<br />Finally a REAL, Honest to Goodness Freelancer RPG Server with its own Mod as well is up and operatonal !!!!!
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="HTTP://WWW.RRJDS.COM">HTTP://WWW.RRJDS.COM</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Bored of the same old PVP Shoot on sight, Kill Kill Kill, with seemingly no other purpose in mind servers. Or servers who claim to be a role playing site but their listed RPG rules are not enforced?
<br />
<br />The RRJDS Mod and ColdFire Server was specifically designed by experienced Fantasy Role Players (Some with over 30 plus years of on and offline gaming experience), with a Freelancer RPG server in Mind.
<br />
<br />Go to <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://WWW.RRJDS.COM">WWW.RRJDS.COM</a><!-- w -->
<br />For Server / Mod information, to read their exclusively used, Rules of Engagement, and for the latest RRJDS Mod version download plus much more!
<br />
<br />Want to Role Play in freelancer with out any of the restrictions of &#8220;you can not fly this ship or that one if you are this type of character&#8221;. Or the ever so popular it seems idea of, &#8220;you can not do this AND that together if you are this or that set Character style&#8221;?
<br />
<br />Tired of being told, &#8220;Yes we are a Role Playing Server&#8221;, BUT when you get all set up you find out that unlike in true RPG style, &#8220;Nope you can not take missions or bounty hunt others if you are &#8220;TAGED&#8221; as a cargo or transport hauler&#8221;.
<br />
<br />WELL that IS NOT the case with the RRJDS Mod and Coldfire Server.
<br />Freelancer Mod Manager beta required to run the mod.
<br />
<br />Due to their tested and planned &#8220;Rules of Engagement&#8221; you finally in true RPG Style and format can fly that Pirate ship AND run cargo at the same time. OR, mine and still take missions or about anything you can imagine if it is possible at the same time. 
<br />
<br />GO AHED, take that NPC Missions as a mercenary, then go Mining or mapping later on as a Cargo Carrier or transport for hire. All is possible under the RRJDS Mod and Coldfire 24/7 Dedicated Server and our exclusively used, Rules of Engagement.
<br />You are supposed to be a FREELANCR after all right??????
<br />
<br />Tired of having to wear a &#8220;TAG&#8221; that tells every gun happy PVPer or pirate in the surrounding systems who and where you are, so they can simply fly up, open fire, and use you for target practice or to get a SCORE on the Universal rankings?
<br />WILL NOT HAPPEN HERE, due to the Server rules and ROE. And if it does, heavens help the players who is not playing by the standards of HONESTY, FAIR PLAY, AND TRUST.
<br />
<br />All this and more at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="HTTP://WWW.RRJDS.COM">HTTP://WWW.RRJDS.COM</a><!-- m -->
<br /> 
<br />Forced to fly a ship you simply hate because you are this or that supposed profession type / Character?  AND STILL with all of this, the server does not enforce RPG Rules due to a fear of &#8220;Losing&#8221; players, thus ruining the gaming experience and fun for you and your friends? Yet you stay, simply because there is &#8220;No where else to go anyway&#8221;?
<br />
<br />WELL at the Coldfire Server you do not need to worry about such frustrations any longer since all our server rules and player conduct interaction is enforced. 
<br />What we say, is EXACTLY what you get. IF a person cannot play by the set standards and rules, they will either change or go!
<br />
<br />Want to be able to run  cargo one moment, go Mining (PROFITABLY) with a friend or more the next, Take a in game mission, then later, go on a Mass Player Bounty Hunt, as you with many others search the systems for a known &#8220;Live Player&#8221; bountied criminal?
<br />
<br />ALL THIS AND MORE IS POSSIBLE with the Coldfire Server and RRJDS Mod.
<br />
<br />Tired of people &#8220;OWNING&#8221; systems or space and forcing you to have to pay out the nose or lose your cargo because your trade route is in &#8220;THEIR&#8221; System? 
<br />
<br />Well NOT with the RRJDS Mod and Coldfire Server, Space is as it was created, (FREE), Space is DANGROUS, but NO ONE owns any system on the Coldfire server. Travel where you want, when you want, in what ship you want, BUT, at your own risk, since Role play does not mean no PVP. It is a Jungle (of asteroids) out there, make sure your weapons are primed, loaded, and that escort has been well paid.
<br />
<br />DOWNLOAD the mod NOW at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://WWW.RRJDS.COM">WWW.RRJDS.COM</a><!-- w --> and see all of our their rules, server info, and other stuff to boot.
<br />
<br />NOTE:::: Clans, Guilds, and Groups are most welcomed, but SERVER RULES ARE ENFORCED. Please do not waste our time nor yours if you do not plan to abide by the server rules and our RPG Rules of Engagement.
<br />
<br />NO there is no privately Clan owned ships here, all ships can be bought, flown, and owned by any player of they have the rep and credits to get it. Sorry we do not want the ship builders to go out of business do wee, free trade, free enterprise. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_shy.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />After 3 years of development, testing, modifying and redoing of the Rules of Engagement, it is PROVEN that this system works for Role Play enjoyment. People ruining the server and other players game enjoyment due to not following the server rules and ROE will not be tolerated nor ignored!
<br />
<br />ALL OF THIS WITH MUCH MUCH MORE in the planning and still to come over the months and years ahead.
<br />
<br />Simply go to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="HTTP://WWW.RRJDS.Com">HTTP://WWW.RRJDS.Com</a><!-- m --> for full mod downloads and information.
<br />
<br />Come give it a try, bring a friend or more. The mod is NEW and WILL expand and grow over time. The server is Dedicated, no continual with out warning reboots unless it is really an emergency system drop. No worries to be half way through or at the end of that extremely hard but lucrative NPC mission to suddenly with no warning have a system restart. Then forcing you to have to do it all over again. Or lose valuable time and map data simply because you had not gotten the chance to land for it to be auto saved since the last drop 5 minutes ago. 8-(
<br />
<br />No battleship arms races found here since with RRJDS, fire power is not the sole purpose of the game nor is PVP everything. New ship designs are here, Ships to actual scale size (yes Sizes are accurately based by mass now), new systems, new mining possibilities that are Truly profitable and mre. 
<br />
<br />All found at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://WWW.RRJDS.COM">WWW.RRJDS.COM</a><!-- w -->
<br />
<br />With New trade commodities / routes, new systems, new races, and new small, medium and larger trade cargo ships to come in the future. We will not base ship design only for Fighter craft here. There is more to Role playing that fighting!
<br />BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, on a server which its&#8217; standards of play, interaction, and rules, ARE ENFORCED.
<br />
<br />So if you are tired of so called RPG Servers, that are really Just Sugar coated Shoot on Sight PVP sites, where PG rules are not really enforced, developed, nor cared about? 
<br />Done with the old thinking that cargo ship players are simply there as targets for people in massively over powered ships and seemingly not supposed to have fun for themselves.
<br />
<br />WELL NOW, your search is over for You Have found it here.
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="HTTP://WWW:RRJDS:COM">HTTP://WWW:RRJDS:COM</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />So dust off the Freelancer Mod manager just one more time. DOWNLOAD the RRJDS MOD that has just been newly released.
<br />AND Come join us in space for an experience I am sure you will enjoy especially as we grow in numbers of like minded players over time.
<br />
<br />WHAT? Want to do a bit of Solo Play as well you say but many mods out there will not allow it anymore?? 
<br />NO PROBLEM HERE, Yes, it is possibly to play t</div>
