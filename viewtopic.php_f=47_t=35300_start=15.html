<br />
<br />Part 3
<br />
<br />Chapter 1
<br />
<br />Getting to Sigma 13, however, wasn&#8217;t that simple.  Micah knew one couldn&#8217;t go straight from the Magellan system to Sigma 13, or at least he did once he examined the readout on the navigation computer&#8217;s screen.  From the California system, their current destination, there were only two real choices:  they&#8217;d have to go through Kusari space or Rheinland space. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, which way?&#8221; Luther asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; Micah sighed, dropping back into the pilot&#8217;s chair.  &#8220;No matter which way we go it&#8217;s going to be difficult; the Star Chaser is a Bretonian freighter.  We won&#8217;t exactly blend in with the ships in Kusari or Rheinland.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I propose going through Rheinland,&#8221; Kruger interjected.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why should we trust you?&#8221; Luther asked.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve done nothing but almost get us killed since you walked into my bar!  I think we should drop you on Los Angeles and be rid of you and your trouble!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;If that is what you and the Captain here desire, please do,&#8221; Kruger shrugged nonchalantly.  &#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t if I were you.  Two of those Hawk fighters survived our little adventure outside Freeport 4.  Believe me; they will be communicating with those who hired them about this ship.  Your only way out of this is to help me.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You talk like you know who hired them, Kruger,&#8221; Micah said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There is always conflict when two groups want the same thing,&#8221; Kruger said.  &#8220;But Rheinland will be safer.  Hawk fighters are not very common in Rheinland, they will be as out of place as we.  In addition, in Rheinland, I have certain&#8230; associates that can help us evade the more heavily traveled routes to the Sigma systems.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Associates?&#8221; Micah asked, his eyebrows raised.  &#8220;Why do I not like the sound of that&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re coming out of hyperspace!&#8221; Luther called out.  &#8220;We are now in the California system.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Nothing had changed in the California system in the past two months as far as Micah could tell.  San Diego Border Station was bustling with activity.  Trains and their escorts of Starfliers and Startrackers made their way between the jumpgate and tradelanes, a pair of Bounty Hunter Piranhas was docking with the station and, as Micah fed power to the engines, a Liberty Police patrol flew over their heads communicating with the station as they passed.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m aiming us for Planet Los Angeles,&#8221; Micah said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s more traffic than the California Minor route, and while I&#8217;d like to think that we&#8217;ll be relatively safe in Liberty, there may be safety in numbers.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your plan seems sound,&#8221; Kruger said, sitting down in the navigator&#8217;s chair and crossing his legs.
<br />
<br />&#8220;In the meantime, Kruger,&#8221; Micah said pointing his finger at the Rheinlander on his ship, &#8220;I want some answers.&#8221;

<br />
<br />Chapter 2
<br />
<br />&#8220;As I&#8217;m sure you know, the GMG supplies over 90% of the H-fuel used in Sirius,&#8221; Kruger said, pacing the small command deck that Micah sometimes jokingly referred to as &#8220;the bridge.&#8221;  &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you also know that the Rheinland fleet was decimated by the GMG.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, the 80 Years War.  So what?&#8221; Luther said, waiting for Kruger to get to the point.
<br />
<br />&#8220;If you remember your history lessons, Mr. Luther, you will recall that Rheinland&#8217;s greatest and final defeat occurred in Sigma 13,&#8221; Kruger responded impatiently.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The wreckage,&#8221; Micah said, &#8220;You want the wreckage.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very good Captain,&#8221; Kruger said, turning from Luther back to the pilot&#8217;s chair.  &#8220;But it&#8217;s not the wreckage we&#8217;re after.  It&#8217;s what is inside the wreckage that interests us.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m almost afraid to ask what it is we&#8217;re looking for in the wreckage of an old Imperial warship,&#8221; Micah said turning his attention toward the controls as the Star Chaser emerged from the tradelane in front of Los Angeles.  As Kruger spoke, Micah sped past the planet and docked with the tradelane to Planet Mojave, putting the ship on auto-pilot all the way to the New York jumpgate.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry Captain, it&#8217;s a piece of intelligence that we believe the battleship Munich was carrying when it was destroyed,&#8221; Kruger said. &#8220;More than that I cannot say without authorization from my superiors.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What superiors?&#8221; Luther asked.  &#8220;And who&#8217;s this &#8220;we,&#8221; you keep talking about?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;My&#8230; associates,&#8221; Kruger replied, his lips turning up slightly.  &#8220;Fear not Mr. Luther; before this is over nothing will be hidden from you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Luther huffed, slumping a bit in his chair, obviously unsatisfied with Kruger&#8217;s explanation.  On auto-pilot, the ship entered the New York jump gate and the black of space was quickly replaced with the mottled tube of hyperspace.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Entering, the New York system,&#8221; Micah announced a few minutes later.
<br />
<br />The Star Chaser dropped out of hyperspace, a transition that was always more abrupt than Micah expected no matter how many times he went through it.  The blackness of space, with it&#8217;s backdrop of stars, reappeared.  The ship was immediately fired upon.  Micah reached for the controls to bring the Chaser back up to full speed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Luther, guns!&#8221; Micah called out, the ship roaring to life beneath their feet.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hawk fighters approaching,&#8221; Kruger said, remarkably calm under the circumstances.  &#8220;Six fighters this time.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s way too many Micah; head for the tradelane,&#8221; Luther said whipping the gunner&#8217;s chair around firing the ship&#8217;s guns.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;They&#8217;re between us and the tradelane,&#8221; Micah said, turning the Chaser ninety degrees, firing the main engines and thrusters and taking the ship on a course parallel to the entrance to the tradelane.  &#8220;That&#8217;s going to be difficult.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Star Chaser lunged forward, spitting laser fire and trying to escape the swarm of small, but deadly, civilian fighter craft.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Shields dropping,&#8221; Kruger stated as calmly as if he&#8217;d been discussing the weather.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am aware of the shields,&#8221; Micah spat back, hitting the shield battery control, quickly becoming annoyed at Kruger&#8217;s deadly calm under fire.  &#8220;How we doing back there Luther?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;The last time I saw this many bogies, I was on a ship that had a few more gunners,&#8221; Luther shot back through gritted teeth, firing constantly and swiveling his chair back and forth wildly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Gotcha.  I&#8217;ll see if I can get us a bit more space,&#8221; Micah said, cutting the engines but still traveling in the same direction as the pursuing fighters.  &#8220;Hold on to something, Kruger.  Firing Z axis thrusters!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Star Chaser, suddenly dropped, relative down, out of the pack of Hawk fighters.  Now in the clear, Micah turned the ship&#8217;s nose back up, toward the Hawks, bringing all the Chaser&#8217;s guns to bear on their attackers.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Let fly, Luther!&#8221; Micah shouted.
<br />
<br />Now able to use all of the ship&#8217;s guns, Luther concentrated his fire on one of the Hawks above them.  Already weakened by the Chaser&#8217;s guns during the pursuit, the hawk came apart in a small, streaking nova above view port of the command deck.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m reading five new contacts in the area.  They&#8217;ve just emerged from the tradelane.&#8221; Kruger reported.  &#8220;They register as Liberty Navy.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What a relief,&#8221; Micah said, reaching for the comm. controls. &#8220;Star Chaser to Liberty Navy patrol in need of assistance.  We are under attack from six Civilian CTE-1500 Hawk fighters.  I repeat we are in need of assistance.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I doubt that very much Lieutenant,&#8221; a deep baritone rumbled over the Star Chaser&#8217;s tiny speakers from one of the Defender heavy fighters. &#8220;You look like you&#8217;re doing just fine.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Captain?&#8221; Micah asked, surprised to hear his former commander&#8217;s voice again but definitely glad.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Who else Lieutenant?&#8221; Captain Phillips replied.  &#8220;All fighters defend that freighter!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Now facing more resistance, the Hawk fighters began to break off toward the jump gate to California rather than face the might of the Liberty Navy in its own territory.  Captain Phillips and his squadron attacked and, with the aid of the Star Chaser managed to destroy the remaining Hawk fighters.
<br />
<br />&#8220;How did you know it was me Captain?&#8221; Micah asked when the battle was over and the ubiquitous Junker CSV was tractoring in the debris. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I saw your little escape maneuver when we jumped out of the tradelane,&#8221; Phillips said with laughter in his voice.  &#8220;And I also remember a certain Lieutenant who got a high percentage of his kills flying backwards, sideways, and upside down.  I&#8217;ve never seen anyone fight like that before or since.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Captain there&#8217;s no up..&#8221; Micah began.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; Phillips interrupted, chuckling over the comm.  &#8220;There&#8217;s no up or down in space.  Don&#8217;t remind me, it gives me motion sickness.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;A former Liberty Navy fighter pilot,&#8221; Kruger mused, almost to himself.  &#8220;The freighter Captain has hidden depths.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;So what are you doing back here now, Lieutenant?&#8221;  Captain Phillips asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I could ask you the same thing, but it&#8217;s just Micah now Captain,&#8221; Micah said.  &#8220;Last time we spoke you were the captain of the Battleship Mississippi.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;They transferred me over to the Missouri a couple of weeks after you left,&#8221; Phillips replied.  &#8220;I just like to get out and stretch my space legs every once in a while, that&#8217;s all.  Good thing I did too.  You in some kind of trouble?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;It sure seems that way,&#8221; Micah said.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t discuss it on an open channel.  All I can tell you is that I need to get to Rheinland as soon as possible.  That&#8217;s the second time we&#8217;ve been attacked by Hawk fighters in as many days.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Phillips replied.  &#8220;Is there anything I can do?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re going to make it to Rheinland like this,&#8221; Micah said.  &#8220;There are only so many fighters I can fend off!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;As much as I&#8217;d like to see you kick some butt in that big tin can you&#8217;re flying, I&#8217;ll make it easy for you,&#8221; Phillips said.  &#8220;My patrol and I will escort you to the edge of Liberty space in the Texas system personally.  Form up and we&#8217;ll leave immediately.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Micah was relieved at Captain Phillips&#8217; offer and accepted at once.  While their trip through Liberty space would no longer be as discreet as Micah, and especially Kruger, would have liked, they would be unlikely to be attacked while inside Liberty space with a full squadron of Navy Defenders as an escort and reinforcements within easy call.
<br />
<br />The small fleet passed quickly and uneventfully through the New York system, past West Point Academy where Micah completed his training, past Norfolk Shipyard and the Battleship Missouri, Phillips&#8217; new command.  Micah passed most of the time the two days the journey across Liberty space took talking with his former captain over the comm., reminiscing over missions flown together and adventures the two men had shared.  Once in the Texas system, the Star Chaser and her escort shot rapidly through the tradelane to Planet Houston, Micah&#8217;s home world.
<br />
<br />Micah didn&#8217;t have time to stop, nor would he have wanted to if he had; none of his family still lived on Houston, having moved to Planet Denver sometime after he&#8217;d joined the Navy.  Instead, the odd convoy paused only long enough for Micah, Luther, and Kruger to decide their route to the Hamburg system and Rheinland space.  Micah chose to go through the Bering system for a number of reasons.  For one, it got the Chaser out of Liberty space that much faster since the jump gate was closer than the one to the Hudson system.  For another, there was a station there, Freeport 2 where they could stop and, hopefully, not be noticed.  Kruger had also intimated that he could contact some of his &#8220;associates&#8221; there without attracting any undue, and unwanted, attention.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is as far as we can go,&#8221; Captain Phillips said over the radio as the convoy approached the jumpgate to the Bering system.  &#8220;There are a few Navy ships patrolling the other side of the jumpgate before you get to the tradelane, but our jurisdiction basically ends here.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thanks Captain,&#8221; Micah replied. &#8220;I owe you one.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;No you don&#8217;t Micah,&#8221; Phillips replied.  &#8220;I wish you could tell me more about what&#8217;s going on.  You don&#8217;t see many Hawk fighters this side of the Crow Nebula; it worries me.  I guess I&#8217;ll just have to wait until you get back.  I&#8217;ll show you around the Missouri, and you can tell me all about it.  Be careful Micah.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I will Captain, and thank you,&#8221; Micah replied.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you when we get back.  Star Chaser out.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Micah closed the comm. channel, and docked with the jumpgate to the Bering system.  The stars disappeared and they were, once again, flung through the kaleidoscope of  hyperspace.       
<br />

<br />Thanks for reading,

<br />Micah
<br />
<br />Part 3
<br />
<br />Chapter 3
<br />
<br />The bar on Freeport 2 looked exactly like its counterpart on Freeport 4.  Except for the color.
<br />The unlikely trio had been fortunate enough to make it from the jumpgate to the Texas system, through the trade lane to Freeport 2 without incident.  Micah had never seen so many asteroids before; the fact that the giant space rocks were of uniform color and almost uniform size made the asteroid field seem to go on forever.  The builders of Freeport 2 had created a small clearing in the rocks and built a space station around a star remarkable for nothing more than the fact that it lit the way from the territory of one House to that of another.
<br />
<br />Micah had seldom felt farther from home despite the fact that he was closer to Planet Houston now than he had been in the Magellan system. 
<br />
<br />Freeport 2 was every bit as busy as the one he was familiar with.  It had been easy for Micah and his companions to lose themselves in the shuffle of traders, shippers, Bounty Hunters, and the ever present criminal element that every Freeport boasted.  To Micah, it seemed a minor miracle that such a diverse group could exist in such close proximity; he knew from experience that, while a pirate and bounty hunter might have a drink next to each other at the bar, there was no deadlier crossfire to be caught in outside the dura-steel and transparent aluminum of the station.
<br />
<br />The three men were now waiting for Kruger&#8217;s &#8220;contact&#8221; onboard the station.  Micah did not know whether to expect &#8220;a cop or a crook,&#8221; as the saying went, but was ready for anything &#8211; Micah knew he was in this thing for the duration now.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know this station is run by the Zoners,&#8221; Micah said, leaning toward Kruger across the table, &#8220;but which ones are they?&#8221;
<br />
<br />The corners of Kruger&#8217;s mouth turned up grimly as he answered.  &#8220;Hard to tell isn&#8217;t it Captain?&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;The Zoners like it that way.  They are a reclusive group and their motives are&#8230; well, their own.  They occupy no territory in the space of any House; they have no enemies and no allies.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Strange,&#8221; Micah replied, shaking his head and taking a sip of his drink.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know what to think of them.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;The affairs of Zoners are inscrutable Captain, but I wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;count them out&#8221; as you or Mr. Luther might say; they know more than you think,&#8221;  Kruger said, leaning across the table toward Micah now and lowering his voice, &#8220;more than most of the groups represented in this bar would like.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;How do you know so much about them?&#8221; Micah asked, eyeing Kruger inquisitively.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am&#8230; well traveled Captain,&#8221; Kruger replied, leaning back from the table in their booth.  &#8220;And let us say that I have had&#8230; contact with the Zoners in the past and leave it at that.&#8221;  &#8220;Is Mr. Luther in position?&#8221; Kruger asked somewhat condescendingly. 
<br />
<br />Micah took a quick peek over his shoulder and spotted Luther, nursing a drink, sitting alone at a table in the middle of the bar.  &#8220;Yeah, he&#8217;s there,&#8221; Micah said.
<br />
<br />Micah thought it might be useful to have some backup at this meeting, despite Kruger&#8217;s insistence to the contrary.  Positioned as he was, Luther would be able to keep an eye on the meeting without being noticed himself and would have the element of surprise if anything went wrong &#8211; unless, of course, Kruger&#8217;s contacts brought their own backup along as well&#8230;
<br />
<br />&#8220;My contact has arrived,&#8221; Kruger said, looking over Micah&#8217;s shoulder toward the door.  &#8220;Do your best not to turn and look Captain,&#8221; Kruger said sharply as Micah began, instinctively, to look towards the door himself.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hello Kruger,&#8221; a voice soon said beside them. 
<br />
<br />Micah looked up to see a tall, blonde man dressed in a faded orange uniform with black and white striped sleeves.  His voice, though deeper than Kruger&#8217;s led Micah to believe that Kruger&#8217;s contact was a Rheinlander too.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hans, so glad to see you,&#8221; Kruger said, as the blonde man sat down in the booth next to Micah.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am relieved to see that you&#8217;ve managed to make it here on time and in one piece, but I must be brief,&#8221; Hans replied, ignoring Micah entirely.  &#8220;It would be better if certain parties do not see us together in this place.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Do you have the information then?&#8221; Kruger asked, lowering his voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I do,&#8221; Hans replied, &#8220;You should be able to get to your destination without attracting too much attention and without leaving a record of your passing.  You will essentially disappear.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Micah was suddenly sure that the two Rheinlanders were referring to jump holes, natural links from system to system often used by criminals and, Micah had heard, in the Border and Edge worlds where there were often no trade lanes to speak of and jumpgates were few and far between.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; Kruger said.  &#8220;A thousand thanks to you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;And now I must be off.  We cannot risk being seen together any longer than necessary,&#8221; Hans replied as he slid out of the booth.  &#8220;By the way Captain,&#8221; Hans said to Micah, acknowledging him for the first time.  &#8220;You should choose better backup.  Your Bretonian friend sticks out like a sore thumb.&#8221;  Hans chuckled slightly to himself as he made his way out of the bar.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What information were you talking about?&#8221; Micah asked.  &#8220;He didn&#8217;t give you anything or tell you anything.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;If you would be so kind as to put your hand in the left pocket of your flight jacket, I believe you will find the information to which I was referring,&#8221; Kruger said nonchalantly.
<br />
<br />Micah shoved his hand in his pocket and felt what could only be a datapad.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Leave it there for now Captain,&#8221; Kruger said.  &#8220;It will be safe enough until we get back to the ship.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then let&#8217;s get Luther and get out of here,&#8221; Micah replied.

			<div class="content">Here's the next installment! I apologize for being later than I had hoped with it but I had to make some rather important plot decisions.  This chapter is fairly long. There's no action in it, unfortunately. It's all VERY important plot development. But fear not! We'll get back to the action soon enough!
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />Micah
<br />
<br />Part 3 
<br />
<br />Chapter 4
<br />
<br />&#8220;The information on the datapad will lead us to a jump hole that will take us to the Hamburg system incognito,&#8221; Kruger said back on the Star Chaser as Micah guided the freighter out of Freeport 2&#8217;s docking bay.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Pretty slick, that Rheinlander chap slipping that pad in Micah&#8217;s pocket like that,&#8221; Luther said with obvious admiration in his voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, Kruger and his pals seem to be pretty good at the cloak-and-dagger routine,&#8221; Micah replied.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;You will soon find that my friends are good at other things as well Captain,&#8221; Kruger returned, not looking up from the nav computer screen.  &#8220;I am feeding the coordinates of the jump hole to the Hamburg system into the navigation computer now.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Locking on to the nav point and engaging the cruise engines,&#8221; Micah replied.
<br />
<br />The Star Chaser&#8217;s massive engine bells began to glow as the cruise engines drew power from the main reactor.  Within seconds, the freighter leapt forward and quickly reached her highest possible speed outside the trade lanes.  Micah turned on the autopilot, knowing that letting the ship&#8217;s computer dodge the asteroids would be easier than doing it manually.
<br />
<br />&#8220;With any luck, whoever is chasing us will be waiting for us at the jumpgate,&#8221; Micah said, turning the pilot&#8217;s seat around to face Luther and Kruger, &#8220;and not the jump hole.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s about time you told us a bit more about what you&#8217;ve gotten us into Kruger?&#8221; Luther asked.  &#8220;Who&#8217;s chasing us and what is so important on some rotten old Imperial battleship that it&#8217;s worth killing over?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes Mr. Luther,&#8221; Kruger said, leaning his chair back against the navigation console.  &#8220;You&#8217;ve been patient long enough.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;A few days ago, while we were still in Liberty space, I told you about the war Rheinland fought with the GMG &#8211; fought and lost,&#8221; Kruger continued.  &#8220;As I&#8217;m sure both of you know, the GMG is the main supplier of H-fuel in all of Sirius.  The 80 years war was ultimately a conflict over mining rights in the Sigma systems. Rheinland wanted, essentially, to &#8216;cut out the middle man,&#8217; as the saying goes.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That didn&#8217;t work out so well,&#8221; Micah pointed out, paying attention to Kruger but keeping an eye on the ship&#8217;s course at the same time.  &#8220;But every school kid on Houston learns what you&#8217;re talking about now; that&#8217;s common knowledge throughout the sector.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;re right Captain, that is the generally accepted view of the 80 years war,&#8221; Kruger responded, turning towards Micah.  &#8220;But what I am about to tell you gentlemen is known only to a few outside the Rheinland government.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;At the Battle of the Yanagi Nebula, the last major conflict of the war (and the most famous battle), the GMG managed to decimate the Rheinland Imperial Fleet,&#8221; Kruger continued.  &#8220;That, also, is generally known.  But what is not common knowledge, what is known to few, is what such a large portion of the Rheinland fleet was doing in the Crow Nebula that day.  That fleet&#8217;s mission was to destroy the GMG&#8217;s base in Sigma 13, the Gas Miner Naha.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me,&#8221; Luther said, waving his hand at Kruger in dismissal.  &#8220;How in blazes would they have destroyed the Naha?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Munich, the battleship whose remains we seek, had been mounted with an experimental weapon &#8211; a weapon of unprecedented capabilities.  The Munich had been mounted with a weapon powered by anti-matter.&#8221; Kruger revealed.  &#8220;No such weapon has ever been used but scientists have hypothesized that one blast from such a weapon would be sufficient to disable any space station currently in existence.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But it&#8217;s also a well known scientific fact that a matter/anti-matter reaction can&#8217;t be contained; it&#8217;s too powerful.  There&#8217;s no way the Imperial Fleet could have had a weapon powered by one back then,&#8221; Micah retorted skeptically.  &#8220;Besides, even if there had been such a weapon why wouldn&#8217;t the Junkers or the GMG themselves have gotten hold of it by now?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;My superiors do not believe that the weapon itself survived the destruction of the Munich,&#8221; Kruger responded. &#8220;One of our operatives in the Sigma 13 system recently discovered indications that the reactor chamber of the weapon, however, may have survived.  The scanner data he obtained is on an extremely unusual frequency; our scout could not have stumbled across this information accidentally.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;ve been looking for it specifically,&#8221; Micah said.  &#8220;You and your &#8216;superiors&#8217; must have quite an infrastructure.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Maybe so Micah,&#8221; Luther chimed in.  &#8220;But once they&#8217;ve got this reaction chamber gadget, all they&#8217;ll need is a barrel and you and I will be responsible for putting a super weapon in the hands of some group we can&#8217;t even identify!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Calm yourself Mr. Luther,&#8221; Kruger said, chuckling to himself.  &#8220;I can assure you that my associates and I have no intention of recreating that weapon.  The ability to control a matter/anti-matter reaction has many other beneficial uses besides weaponry.  Imagine it, Mr. Luther: infinite power for cities and industry, no more pollution, and&#8230; propulsion.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;The GMG, of course,&#8221; Micah said, resisting the urge to smack himself in the forehead.  &#8220;The GMG would have every reason to want to find and suppress technology like this.  If space craft were to convert to anti-matter power sources and engines, the market for H-fuel would crash overnight.  The GMG would be financially annihilated.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That would explain all the Hawk fighters,&#8221; Luther said, rubbing his jaw thoughtfully.  &#8220;But if this reaction chamber is so secret, how would they have found out about it?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We don&#8217;t really know,&#8221; Kruger admitted.  &#8220;Our best guess is that the GMG had an operative placed highly enough in the Rheinland military during the war to have had knowledge of the weapon&#8217;s existence before the fleet commenced its attack.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Leading to the desperation tactics used by the GMG to destroy the Rheinland fleet in the gas pockets at Yanagi,&#8221; Micah said, putting the pieces together.  &#8220;The GMG knew their only chance to hang on to Sigma 13 was to stop the Rheinland fleet before it reached Naha.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;And those miners knew that nebula like a Molly knows an ice field,&#8221; Luther added, chipping in as well. &#8220;They led the Rheinland fleet right into a trap.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Precisely gentlemen,&#8221; Kruger said, smiling his first real smile since he&#8217;d met Micah and Luther.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking for the chamber since we learned of its existence.  The Rheinland government appears to have no record that it ever existed &#8211; the project was kept off the books, so to speak.  Probably due to all the internal turmoil after Rheinland&#8217;s defeat, combined with the fact that most of the military and scientific personnel assigned to the project died on the Munich, the reaction chamber was forgotten.&#8221;  Kruger paused.  &#8220;The GMG, on the other hand, have been looking for the reaction chamber since the war ended.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;They still haven&#8217;t found it after all this time?&#8221; Luther asked incredulously.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Space is large Mr. Luther,&#8221; Kruger said.  &#8220;Space is very large.  And even the GMG, at home in the murky depths of the Crow Nebula cannot search its confines quickly.  Our scout was killed by GMG Hawks soon after transmitting his discovery.  Fortunately, he managed to wipe his ship&#8217;s communication logs before he died.  Many of our operatives have reported unusual GMG activity in the past week or two outside their usual range, outside the Crow Nebula.  They are looking gentlemen, and we cannot allow them to find it.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Whoa, whoa, whoa,&#8221; Micah said, waving his arms.  &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about this thing like it actually exists.  Scientists in Liberty and the Liberty Navy have been trying to come up with a way to contain an anti-matter reaction for decades.  They&#8217;ve said it&#8217;ll be pretty much impossible for the next hundred years or so.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That, Captain, will have to wait until we reach our destination,&#8221; Kruger replied. &#8220;When we do, you will be fully briefed on our mission.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Our destination?&#8221; Luther asked.  &#8220;I thought our destination was Sigma 13.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Surely, Mr. Luther, you did not expect to go charging into the GMG&#8217;s homeland with a single freighter did you?&#8221; Kruger asked.  &#8220;As impressive as your gunnery skills and the Captain&#8217;s piloting skills are we will require an escort if we are to have any chance of survival, much less success.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;So where are we going?&#8221; Micah asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You will see soon enough,&#8221; Kruger replied as the nav computer&#8217;s proximity alarm began to chime.  &#8220;Look, we are approaching the jump hole to the Hamburg system.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Turning back toward the controls, Micah turned off the auto-pilot and guided the Star Chaser toward the jump hole.  Suddenly, the ship lurched and was pulled, as if by an unseen hand, into hyperspace.</div>
