			<div class="content">As the Omicron Gamma System's star shown brilliantly a flight of Titans appeared coming from it towards columns of NOMAD vessels. Overall two dozen titan very heavy fighters were on an intercept course for the fleet.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Gold Flight Leader, I am engaging the enemy hostiles.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Gold Leader this is Crete, acknowledged, reinforcements from Leon and Cadiz base have been launched.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What about the orbital ring, we can have another dozen craft launched if you can get that online, plus our reserve of the older Legionairre and Centurion models.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sorry no luck yet it seems to be jammed.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We're entering into attack range, Wing 1 and 2 concentrate your fire on the enemy battleships, we're using our precious reserve of sunslayers, all other groups, keep the fighters off our backs.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The craft broke off into the pounding guns of the NOMAD fleet, eight battleships were in front of them and over two hundred fighters, including several dozen of the new types.  Gold 2 and 4 burned up nearly instantly.  Gold Leader and three kept going making their strafing run on the battleship.  Their Salmanca's pounded away at the shields as they got in close.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bombs away.&#8221; three said.  As the two in near perfect coordination each let off a salvo of sunslayers which exploded in bright white flashes as the shield bubble of the NOMAD ship exploded. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Three form up, and lets finish this thing off.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Copy sir.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The two formed up in a pair as they went over the vessel dropping about a dozen screamers into the center of the NOMAD warships hull splitting sundering it at the midsection.  As they went away a bright azure shockwave ripped through the fleet behind them as ships got out of the way.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Gold leader here, scratch one battleship.&#8221;
<br />
<br />As the leader of the flight said that his ship exploded followed by three's from fire from one of the unknown NOMAD vessels.
<br />
<br />Wing 5 formed up, they were the heavy anti-fighter wing.  &#8220;5-1 here, Lock firestalkers on the NOMAD's main fighter group.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;5-2, locked.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;5-3, locked.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;5-4, locked.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Missiles away boys&#8221;
<br />
<br />The ships accelerated with after burners as they approached moved in at fast speed on enemy NOMAD fighters, as they were about to pass the group unleashed missiles, all but three found their mark, the ones that did cause bright white explosion flashes as they incinerated the NOMAD craft.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We got 'em.  Count 22 dead rat bastards.&#8221; they exclaimed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Gold 3.  I'm taking command of the squadron.  Concentrate all your firepower on the larger fighter craft.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The remaining about 15 Titans broke off from their targets and began assailing the new NOMAD ships.  The hits were few but they managed to hit several down.  Meanwhile the Titans were paying a heavy cost of ignoring everything else, though doubtlessly Gold 3 had made the correct judgement.  6 more Titans were downed at that time.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Corsair command, all craft return.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We can't we are surrounded.&#8221; replied Gold leader.
<br />
<br />As they said that two chromuim hulled battleships decloaked openning fire into the NOMAD fleet with massive columns of energy from the rear.  The two rear battleships the NOMADs had were torn to pieces by the warships piercing bolts.
<br />
<br />On the bridge of the seemingly newer of the two newly arrived battleships a familiar but much aged face sat in the commanders seat overseeing the assault.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Commodore Edison Trent of the Order Battleship Horus, all Titan craft, we will cover your retreat.  Decloak boys!&#8221; the man said.  
<br />
<br />Two entire flights of Anubis VHF decloaked from the sides.  They poured out missiles and torpedos into the NOMAD fleet as the Titan's attempted to escape.  They didn't even to bother to wait for orders from HQ.  The NOMADs began a full retreat immediately as they were cut down by the better positioned Order vessels, to many had been lost in that first attack to mount a comeback and then deal with the arrival of reinforcements, which they supposed would probably be arriving any time now.  Gold 3 openned a transmission to the Horus.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Commander Uther Kun of the 2nd Corsair Flight.  Thankyou.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don't mention it.  You better reassemble their forces, that was only a scout force, they will be back with probably thrice that amount for the second attack.&#8221; the commodore replied.  
<br />
<br />Just as Uther and the remaining defenders of Crete landed their fighters at Tripoli for repair a giant rumble was heard.  Trent openned a commline to Uther, he explained about the silent decades old war being waged on the fringes of Siruis, about the NOMAD origins, and many other think.  Then he said something interesting, &#8220;the artifact that was taken from the Corsairs, it must remain secret, it must remain safe.  We believe the new units which dispatched your Titan's are somehow generated by combining the power of many of their smaller fighters into one of those killing machines, via this type of artifact.  Wait a second I'll be right back...&#8221;  
<br />
<br />A transmission came into the base.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Commodore Trent, Commander Kun get back out here, the NOMADs are launching their second wave it is four times the size!&#8221; the transmission came.  As the transmission was received Corsair guards walked into the hangar and raised their weapons.  The omni present annoying chief counselor of the Elder walked in.  &#8220;Commander Kun, your duties are over, a deal for the lives of Commodore Edison Trent and his men in exchange for sparing the Corsairs the wrath of the NOMADs has been reached between the Elder and the head of the NOMAD armada.  Against such a force there can be no victory.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Kun shook his head the quickly closed his cockpit, as soon as his weapons came online he fired his turret around shooting up the guards.  They had been infected then he left the hangar port to fight, Crete would not fall, he only hoped reinforcements would arrive.  His place was by the Orders, dying for his homeworld.  But there was always his brother, Triyun.  He sent an encoded transmission of what was really going on, he only hoped it would reach him in time.</div>

			<div class="content">&lt;This is Demon Fires leader to Merry Men, we should be in view of the jumphole now. We'll take that to Magellan, and then on to Manchester and Cambridge&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Roger that. Setting Course&gt;
<br />
<br />The 12 Sabres flew through the quiet mist of the badlands to the Magellan jumphole, covering the transports in almost a net-like formation.
<br />
<br />&lt;This is Theta 3-4, I'm picking up hostile contacts on scanners. Looks like Rogues&gt; That was Maria. She had joined back up with the group as they entered New York.
<br />
<br />&lt;Affirmed, two wings of bloodhounds showing up on scanners&gt; said Erich into the intercom, strangely controlled. &lt;Wing 3 break off and engage the fighters.&gt; Almost immediately, Hans, Mueller, he, and Maria dropped out of the formation readying their weapons.
<br />
<br />Mueller struck first, dashing in on his target with round after round of green laser fire. Maria entered the fray next,  followed closely by Hans shooting missiles after the bloodhounds. Lastly, Erich came into range. <i>Let's see how these Salamancas work out... </i>. He flew into the melee, picked out a target and began firing his new guns.
<br />
<br />Erich nearly gasped. The...what did Hans call it...Del Cid took one shot to bring down the bloodhound's shields. Following that fire he plunged into the fray, shooting out red bolts of flame that exploded in an array of bright blue as they burned through the enemy ships. The Salamancas were perfect beyond belief--powerful, agile, rapid...Hans too seemed to be enjoying his new weapons--laughing out loud over the intercom as Rouges exploded around him. 
<br />
<br />One last fighter remained. Erich croaked &lt;This one is mine&gt; and tagged it, following after it and destroying it utterly after only five rounds of fire.
<br />
<br />&lt;Boss, they've made it through the jumphole by now. We should go&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Sure, let's get out of here. Setting course for jumphole&gt;
<br />
<br />They found the last train making its way through the jumphole just as they arrived. Erich moved his Sabre through it, preparing for the journey into the tunnel of light...</div>

<br />The battleship drifted through the orange clouds, eventually a spark flew from the rear of the ship and the brilliant blue light of a bretionian battleship engine shone into space
<br />
<br />&quot;There we go sir engines online&quot;
<br />&quot;Good now how are the repairs coming?&quot;
<br />&quot;Everything is done sir just 2 more consoles to replace&quot;
<br />
<br />Suddenly space folded before them at the battle ship was dragged to a new location. There were no nebulas in the back ground or around them, only the blackness of space. This area of space teemed with jump holes of every size, shape and color.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok i want an explanation now people&quot; The commodore yelled
<br />&quot;Well we may be in the rumored 'jumphole nexus'&quot;
<br />&quot;So one of these will take us home?&quot;

			<div class="content">OOC- Sorry I haven't been able to post.  I haven't had time to read through everyone's posts, so I hope this won't interfere with anything.
<br />
<br />IC-
<br />
<br />Name- Rear Admiral William Black 
<br />Unit- 3 Cruisers (Reconciliation, Victory, Nemisis), 2 Light Fighter Sqadrons (Ghost Squadron, Lightning Squadron)
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes!  Got one!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice shooting, Ghost 3!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks, Admiral.&quot;
<br />
<br />Admiral Black stood on the bridge of the cruiser Reconciliation.  He watched as Ghost Squadron and Lightning Squadron slaughtered the would-be attackers of the gold convoy.  The sleek Daggers of the Lane Hacker squadron were no match for his advanced models of Patriot fighters.  His two fighter squadrons chewed through the Hacker ships.  The three cruisers sat back with the Universal transports and kept the Hackers from getting too close.  It was an old method of defense, one perfected by Black and his men.  If anyone in the squadrons got in trouble, the cruisers could provide covering fire for them with their long range weapons.  
<br />
<br />Fighting pirates in the Independent Worlds was far different than destroying Bretonian and Kusari capital ships in the Great Colony War a decade back.  Black had adopted new methods of fighting pirates with capital ships, and had used it successfully many times.  He had stopped the Hackers from building new bases three times, and had stopped the Rougues from expanding into Magellan as well.
<br />
<br />Black looked up, and noticed that the remaining Hackers were no more than floating particle bits.  Good, another victory, and it was even greater now because when he looked at his sensor screen, all his fighters were returning.  No losses was a common occurence, and when they did lose a pilot, they could either recruit a new one, or the Navy would send them a replacement.  Well, a good run, and the normal 10% of the profits deal would provide them with enough money to get some more upgrades on the fighters.
<br />
<br />Another good day.</div>

<br />IC :
<br />Battleship Canada
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.guihome.com/apart/battleshipstatus.htm' Target=_Blank>Ship Status</a>
<br />
<br />The Commander was sitting in the underground's base lounge, while waiting for his drink. Some Rheinland Ale... Definitivly better than Liberty's. The Liberty Navy Commander contacted him and told him the several 'Good Jobs' he expected, along with 100 thousands credits. Enought to repair the ship, and have a little extra for his troops. Of course, the ship still had to head toward Liberty's Secret base, in Alaska for the more serious repairs, but that wasn't really trouble. Several Rheinlan d ships and gunboats would escort the ship, while cloaked. Battleship Canada's Escort needed to stay secret, or else the public would ask way too many questions. But Canada didn't require Cloaking, as it was now almost fully functionnal, at least from the outside.
<br />
<br />The route was simple. The battleship was two jumps away from Liberty Space, afterwhich it could be taken care of by the Liberty Navy and the LSF - The intelligence branch of Liberty's Navy.
<br />
<br />The ship undocked, along with a part of its escort in the front, and another behind. They travelled throught each tradelane, deactivating them for 20 seconds once the jump was complete. The big escort went throught the jumphole leading to hamburg, and headed behind Planet Hamburg toward the jumphole leading to Bering, afterwhich they made a circle around Uioners' base, defeating the 2, 3 wings that appeared nearby quite easily. As the ship was about to travel Texas' Jumphole, the commander thanked Rheinland's Fleet, and told them that their help was greatly appreciated. On the other side of the jumphole -....
<br />
<br />'System Jump Complete, all systems show green status'.
<br />
<br />The engineer flicked several switches to shutdown the different computers that failed during the whole trip. One of the three power cells was down, so he put it on standby. He rerouted several power generators around the ship to compensate the ones lost, and the boat was ready to float toward Liberty, escorted by the Navy....

			<div class="content">ACH triyun what the HELL are you doing with those freakin battleships are fighters??!?!
<br />
<br />No matter. Their ships can't carry cruise disruptors <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>...
<br />
<br />Erich emerged from the jumphole shocked--Nomad battleships. Two nomad battleships and hundreds of blue, glassy ships hovering outside the jumphole.
<br />
<br />&lt;All ships activate cruise engines. Thetas 3 and 4 launch missiles! NOW! we have to get the documents out of here!&gt;
<br />
<br />Immediately all ships' exhausts began to sparkle as cruise engines loaded--even as ships exploded in their midst. Erich himself selected a battleship and sent missile after burning missile in a desperate attempt to buy the Fires and Merry Men enough time....
<br />
<br />&lt;Boss! Get out of here!&gt; cried Mueller as he took down fighter after fighter
<br />
<br />&lt;NO! I can't abandon my troop&gt; Sabres exploded around them. Erich was getting desperate as his men died.
<br />
<br />&lt;Go! we'll finish these guys off.&gt;
<br />
<br />Erich realized that Mueller would do anything to keep his boss alive--<i>anything </i>. Perhaps...
<br />
<br />No time to think about that. As he activated his cruise engines and flew into the distance, he felt a sudden pang of loss at his lifelong friend...an overwhelming loss. Almost as if it was Maria or even Karl in that ship.
<br />
<br />The first battleship exploded in a dizzying array of blue sparks, sending nomad fighters temporarily out spinning out of control and of course. Out of the corner of his eyes, Mueller could see the falcons and sabres speeding away into the distance--what was left of them anyways. He could not see anything left of the two wings he had ordered to engage the nomads. Desperately, keeping in mind only one thing, he launched a last missile salvo at the second battleship which exploded in midair, crying out &quot;FREEDOM!&quot; as his ship exploded.</div>
