			<div class="content">Hi all
<br />
<br />since this topic seems to have turned into a flame war (or something of the sort) i'd like to add my say to the fray and see what happens.
<br />
<br />i'll comment on most of the sayings that Nog said, even tho Tasiin has anwserd them very well.
<br />
<br />&quot;Fl Crashes at random when a web browser is left running.&quot;
<br />
<br />hum i never browser a web page AND play games, but i have left IE open and theres no prob
<br />
<br />&quot;Fl crashes for no reason for many players.&quot;
<br />
<br />aint had a prob with 3 of my comps
<br />
<br />&quot;It has fatal sound card issues with SB Live and Audigy cards. (Not entirely FL's fault)&quot;
<br />
<br />dont got it so cant comment but in most forums i aint seen many complains about the sound
<br />
<br />&quot;The installer has a fatal bug that does not permit the game to be installed on some machines.
<br />FL has graphics issues with the latest Nvidia chipset and most ATI chipsets.&quot;
<br />
<br />worked fine on the 3 comp's one was formatted and reinstalled again all worked fine
<br />
<br />&quot;Many players cannot connect to MP games despite having done everything correctly.&quot;
<br />
<br />hum u sure? i got a router and firewall and it works fine, learn to configure stuff and its sorted
<br />
<br />&quot;Microsoft has not kept the master servers up on a reliable basis.&quot;
<br />
<br />tell me when the main server has been down, cuz its worked every time for me and i been playing online for 3 weeks now
<br />
<br />&quot;2 out of 3 of the masters listed in the Freelancer.ini file do not exist on the internet despite having registered domaign names.&quot;
<br />
<br />thats a MS prob alright, but notice they have been cut out with // or so, = BACKUP :p
<br />
<br />&quot;The Master server lists will list dead servers as live for hours after they are gone.&quot;
<br />
<br />this didnt have with 2 of my comps, the second i shut down the server and refreshed the list, they didnt show up anymore
<br />
<br />&quot;When a failed connection attempt is made, FL stupidly sends a last packet to the dead server and then waits for a return, locking up the game for 30 seconds while it waits for a packet that will never come.&quot;
<br />
<br />just making sure..  ESC key is helpful
<br />
<br />&quot;The game browser server polling runs at a snails pace.&quot;
<br />
<br />how many servers do u think there is? how many ppl wanna connect to them? how many ppl want the list of servers BEFORE they have to wait 7 years for the ping times?
<br />
<br />&quot;No cheat protection what so ever. (what were you thinking here?)&quot;
<br />
<br />my god, if your lame enough to cheat go get a life
<br />
<br />
<br />Now to the gameplay:
<br />
<br />yes yes fun time now :p
<br />
<br />&quot;AI physics allow large ships to spin uncontrollably in certain circumstances.&quot;
<br />
<br />never seen it b4, cut down on the drugs plz
<br />
<br />&quot;Lag can cause mines to vastly extend their blast and detection ranges.&quot;
<br />
<br />get broadband - dial up sux :p
<br />
<br />&quot;There are items for sale that cannot be bought.&quot;
<br />
<br />never seen this b4 - less drugs plz
<br />
<br />&quot;SP only jumpholes are not removed in MP play, only disabled.&quot;
<br />
<br />REALISTIC WORLD
<br />
<br />&quot;Thrusters can actually slow a ship under certain circumstances.&quot;
<br />
<br />which circumstances r they?
<br />
<br />&quot;If you lag out in a &quot;random&quot; battle, it is often seen as a loss, and all cargo is lost. I can see this being ok in missions, though.&quot;
<br />
<br />dial up sux :p
<br />
<br />&quot;Auto pilot can often crash players into bases, jumpgates and, planets while attempting to dock. &quot;
<br />
<br />never seen this the whole time i was a newbie in solo, but now i drive right next to the dock and it docks right away
<br />
<br />&quot;Auto pilot does not account for formation for the wingman of the formation. This can cause wingmen to be destroyed when local objects are reletively sparse. When traveling around a sun or planet this can be especially deadly to the wingman&quot;
<br />
<br />poor poor wingman,  learn to fly yourself and dont b lazy
<br />
<br />&quot;Players can be destroyed while in the docking sequence locked view by other players.&quot;
<br />
<br />as tasiin said, u cant hurt players as they dock
<br />
<br />&quot;There is no discernable auto reset for derelict ship items.&quot;
<br />
<br />go raid a derelict warehouse and go back there the same day - is the stuff there again? didnt think so
<br />
<br />&quot;Players always start as navy in MP. Needs to have no affiliation.&quot;
<br />
<br />kk sure u want the liberty police shooting u at the first second of the game when your in a star flyer?
<br />
<br />&quot;Server engine is unstable at best. Totally unreliable at worst.&quot;
<br />
<br />when? server worked fine for me
<br />
<br />&quot;Game installations can &quot;die&quot; for no reason. Making the game unplayable. Sometimes even uninstalling the game and reeinstalling the game does not fix this.&quot;
<br />
<br />didnt u complain about the installation already? also this aint a gameplay fault - make a new heading plz
<br />
<br />&quot;The default game resolution runs above most existing cards optimal specs. 800X600 32bps default is fine.&quot;
<br />
<br />wtf u on about? get a up-2-date grapics card
<br />
<br />works fine on a 16mb card which my lame comp uses
<br />
<br />&quot;I think I made my point here.&quot;
<br />
<br />which point would that b? plz say it in simple to read, cuz atm your point = d u h ?
<br />
<br />
<br />well that was much fun and would love to carry on, so if Nog or some other such person's would like to reply, b my guest
<br />
<br />personally i think FL is a great game, i had no probs with it so far and im sure as hell wont get a prob, Gratz to everyone who took part in making the game and may FL2 b better.
<br />

			<div class="content">ive encountered only about 2-3 problems on that list. theres one that you listed in which i can totally prove you wrong:
<br />
<br />&quot;Fl Crashes at random when a web browser is left running.&quot;
<br />
<br />Never happened to me, even when using it with AOL (ran perfect).
<br />
<br />EDIT: oh, and another one i can fix:
<br />
<br />&quot;Players always start as navy in MP. Needs to have no affiliation.&quot;
<br />
<br />All you have to do is kill a bunch of Liberty Navy ships until theyre neutral (or hostile if you want) then kill a bunch of ships from whatever is next (LSF) then just keep doing this until you reach the faction you want.

			<div class="content">Stinger: you're right, None of the issues pertain to every one out there. Actually None of them pertain to me. However, the point was not to bash Freelancer, only to point out to Tasiin that Freelancer as bug free as he would claim it too be. If course I can see by both of your replies that you have actually failed to see the entire point.
<br />
<br />Note that most of those bugs on the list have been previously reported here.
<br />I could have really nitpicked and got into things like brush placement issues and the odd bounding box issue with AI and asteroids, but I didn't. There are at least 20 or so such issues across the galaxy that I have found, but that is the difference between one who volunteers for beta testing and one who does it as a profession.
<br />
<br />As much as the overall gamepley itself is important, the state of the game engine and supporting files is all the more important. FL now ranks fourth in sales. How good is that if a quarter of it's sales are lost afterwards as returns?
<br />
<br />How can id Software make a game with medeochre gameplay and turn it into an instant No1 seller while DA and Microsoft can put one out thats such fantastic fun and yet months later it's finally making it to No4 on the top sellers list?
<br />
<br />I'll tell you why. Because id games don't have fatal issues on such a large scale out of the box.
<br />
<br />Are you happy with Freelancer as it is? If you are, Great! I'm happy for you. Me, I love the game but am dissapointed in the problems that people are having with it. I personnaly think the Dev time should have been extended before release and would have recommended that had I been testing it. There would have been little harm in holding back till Fall to iron out the biggest issues and Freelancer would have been better off out of the box by far. So now we get a buggy release just before the summer vacation when video game sales are way off the peak season in the largest markets.
<br />
<br />Besides, I wouldn't have posted the bug list anyways if Tasiin hadn't acted like such a child and started off with the flaming. So blame his spouting for it.
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Idiot. Beta 1196 was more stable and complete than most retail games out there now, and you're telling us 1.0 is buggy? I can think of maybe only one or two minor bugs at the moment, seriously, what are you smoking? FL is one of the most stable and bug-free games I've seen in quite a while. I wouldn't be complaining. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Bah! For $54, if I were one of those of whome Freelancer wouldn't even install or run properly after installation, I would have chewed Microsoft's ear off right through to the other side. Some of us have to work for our money. We don't get it from our parents. We want quality, fatal bug-free products. NO EXCUSES!
<br />And what's with the flaming? I thought this was a FAMILY board.</div>

			<div class="content">I have had no problems with the game what so ever,but I would like that it would be a tad more realistic about cruise speeds and drifting.
<br />
<br />Cruise speed should be increased to like 600k/ps and if you are drifting at cruise speed then it would make sense to be able to increase speed by firing the thrusters (This would be the way to do it in real space.) and if you are drifting it is not realistic for the ship to slow down.
<br />
<br />This is not complaints only wishes and  I wouldn&#180;t even bother the Devs with it cause it is surely something the Mod community will fix soon.
<br />
<br />my 2 cents.

It only takes one hand and takes like 1/2 and hour just to go anywhere......boooooooooooooooooooooooooooring.&quot; - Hand Solo
<br /> 
<br />then maybe you should f##k off from the freelancer forums if you dont even play the game anymore and consider it dull
<br /> 
<br />go off on your own somewhere and think up some more &quot;hilarious&quot; puns of star wars characters... yeah!! that'll be GREAT!!!!

<br />personally i've never experienced any bugs playing freelancer, EVER. everything runs mint, and my mate just got a copy, and guess what, AUDIGY sound card and nvidia 128mg graphics card, still no problems. i reckon he was makin those problems up. i still don't know where the elite server is (noone's givin me an ip) so i can't comment on the random blowings up either, but no probs for me.

			<div class="content">chrisvarns: That's GREAT! I only wish everone had it as easy as you. I have no problems running Freelancer either. But it seems that at least half of the buyers do, and half of those never get their issues resolved satisfactorly.
<br />
<br />My point was that there is no excuse to release a game that does not run on such a wide spectrum of machines. I never expected DA to do a fully public beta for compatibility (Microsoft would have kittens over it). I think may be it would have been better if DA had screened it's beta crew to ensure that wider range of machine configurations were used. This especially since hard core gamers tend to centralize around  a reletively few different peices of hardware.</div>
