			<div class="content">Tekagi: I'm doing the disclaimer today, so...he doesn't own Freelancer, but he does own this fic. Do not use it without permission and as this is his his first fic, don't flame. (Pulls knives out of his sleeves and turns all freaky looking) GOT THAT!?
<br />
<br />Stop, you're scaring the readers!
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 1: The Insanity Begins </b>
<br />
<br />(IMO, chapter 1 is not very good compared to the other ones, so if you don't like this one, just try reading the second chapter, it's much better, and my English teacher would murder me if she saw this huge run-on sentence)
<br />
<br />In A.D. 2201&#8230;War had begun.
<br />
<br />(Coalition ships appear in front of the planet and start bombing it)
<br />
<br />Alliance soldier: What happen?
<br />
<br />Alliance commander: Someone set us up the bomb!
<br />
<br />AS: We get signal.
<br />
<br />AC: What !! Main screen turn on.
<br />
<br />(Coalition officer appears)
<br />
<br />AC: It&#8217;s You!
<br />
<br />Coalition officer: How are you gentlemen! All your planet are belong to us. You are on the way to destruction.
<br />
<br />AC: What you say!
<br />
<br />CO: You have no chance to survive make your time. Ha ha ha ha! (Disappears)
<br />
<br />AC: Take off every &#8220;Sleeper Ship&#8221;.
<br />
<br />AS: You know what you doing?
<br />
<br />AC: Move &#8220;Sleeper Ship&#8221;. For great justice.
<br />	
<br />And so the sleeper ships launched, broke through the Coalition blockade, and headed for the Sirius sector, as the Alliance technicians tried desperately to fix the translators. But then, a new threat arrived&#8230;
<br />
<br />(Nomad battleship decloaks)
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: Tremble in fear, humans! There can be no victory against the might of the Nomads!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: You also can&#8217;t beat us!
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: -_-
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: MWAHAHA, FLEE IN TERROR, EARTHLINGS! WE WILL ASSIMILATE YOU!
<br />
<br />Alliance commander: Ookay&#8230;&#8230;
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: Don&#8217;t mind him, people; he just watched a marathon of Star Trek last night.
<br />
<br />Nomad 4: Now you shall die! FIRE THE RAY OF KERBLAZIFICATION!
<br />
<br />What will happen next? Well, you&#8217;ll just have to wait until next time to find out! MUAHAHAHA!!!!
<br />
<br />Tekagi: (Pulls knife out of his sleeve) Grrrr&#8230;.
<br />
<br />Eep! Okay, I get the point, I&#8217;ll continue!
<br />
<br />Tekagi: (Very politely) Thank you. (Walks out)
<br />
<br />He scares me sometimes. Anyway, back to the story.
<br />
<br />Nomad 4:  Nomad 2 (I&#8217;m too lazy to think of names for them), do the honors.
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: Um, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s such a good ide-NO, NOT THAT BUTTON!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: What? I thought that fires the beam!
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: For the 15th time, the red button marked &#8220;DANGER: DO NOT PUSH&#8221; does NOT fire the beam!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: Then what does it do?
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: It&#8217;s the self-destruct button, you idiot! You nearly killed us all!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: Well, sorry! What does fire the beam, then?
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: THE GREEN BUTTON THAT SAYS &#8220;FIRE THE BEAM&#8221; ON IT!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: Ok, so the red one fires the beam, and the green one blows the ship up. Got it.
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: WHY ME? WHY ME? WHY-(Hit with a tranquilizer dart) mmeeeee&#8230;*Falls asleep* 
<br />
<br />Got him. He should be out for at least the rest of the chapter. And you should keep him <i>very </i> far away from Nomad 2 for a while.
<br />
<br />Nomad 4: Definitely.
<br />
<br />Well, you&#8217;d better fire the beam before the human ships that have been attacking you through the whole scene but haven&#8217;t been mentioned until now blow you up. (Throws a smoke bomb)
<br />
<br />(The smoke dies down as I&#8217;m opening the door to leave) D&#8217;OH! (Walks out the door)
<br />
<br />Nomad 4: Fire the beam, Nomad 2! Oh, and make sure to hit the green button, not the red one.
<br />
<br />(Outside the Nomad battleship)
<br />
<br />Alliance commander: C&#8217;mon, we&#8217;ve got to destroy that Nomad battleship before it blows up the sun!
<br />
<br />Alliance pilot: There&#8217;s a strange energy reading coming from the ship now. 
<br />
<br />AC: NO, THEY&#8217;RE CHARGING THE WEAPON UP! WE&#8217;RE TOO LATE!
<br />
<br />(Nomad battleship charges the energy up to 100%, and promptly explodes)
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: Crap, wrong button. Oh well, we shall meet again. MUAHAHA-(Burns up in the sun&#8217;s corona)
<br />
<br />So due to the idiocy of Nomad 2, the Nomads were defeated and the solar system was saved. The sleeper ships then arrived in the Sirius Sector, set up colonies, and lived in peaceful harmony with one another. Except for the Hispania, of course, but everyone knows about that. If you didn&#8217;t, well (in Bill Nye voice) NOW YOU KNOW!
<br />
<br />THE END
<br />
<br />Trent: O_O I wasn&#8217;t even in it!
<br />
<br />That was a joke, Trent. Geez&#8230;
<br />
<br />Trent: Uhhh&#8230;Hah, you fell for it! Of course I knew it was a joke!
<br />
<br />Sure you did&#8230; 
<br />
<br />Review this or I sic Tekagi on you!
<br />
<br />Do a barrel roll!

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 2: Of Psychotic Nomads and Trent&#8217;s Eloquent Speech   </b>
<br />
<br />All was going well on Freeport 7 that day. Well, except for a few minor incidents, like when some genius threw a lit cigarette into a recycling bin full of paper and nearly set fire to the station, and later when someone asked him about an alien artifact he was carrying. For the next hour or so, he was seen going around on all fours and muttering and hissing to himself. Something about a &#8220;precious&#8221;. But the point is, it was (by their standards, anyway, as the station would be nearly destroyed about every other week) a pretty calm and uneventful day. Little did they know that their lives would be turned upside down in a matter of minutes. The Nomads were coming (dun dun duuuuunn).
<br />
<br />They were coming. There was an artifact on this space station that must be destroyed or they would risk defeat at the hands of these humans that were so un-advanced (Is that even a word?) that they didn&#8217;t even know how to grow spaceships. Normally, the humans would never see them coming, but this time there was an exception&#8230;
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: WHERE ARE THE HUMANS! MUST KILL HUMANS! KILL!! MWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
<br />
<br />Yep, that&#8217;s why. You see, about 1 out of every 50 Nomads suffers from a strange affliction that causes them to have a psychotic episode every time they so much as see anything designed by humans. And these Nomads were unlucky enough to get within sight of the Sigma-19 Jump Gate on their way to Freeport 7. But enough rambling, let&#8217;s get on with the story.
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: Quiet, the humans will hear us coming!
<br />
<br />Nomad 3:  HUMANS? WHERE?!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: There are no humans around here, but if you just shut up at least you&#8217;ll get to kill some once we get to the station!
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: YAY! KILL THE HUMANS! (Starts cackling insanely and shouting &#8220;KILL!&#8221; )
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: SHUT UP NOMAD 3!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: Um, guys, we&#8217;re very close to the station now.
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: (Notices the station is only 5K away) Oh, right. Prepare to attack!
<br />
<br />END OF CHAPTER
<br />
<br />(Dodges a thrown knife) It was a JOKE, Tekagi! Stop trying to kill me!
<br />
<br />Tekagi: Well, I didn&#8217;t think it was very funny. (Turns very scary looking) NOW FINISH THE CHAPTER NOW!
<br />
<br />Hmm, maybe it&#8217;s not such a bad idea to paint the Arch in hippie colors.
<br />
<br />Tekagi (Who happens to be the exact opposite of a hippie): EEP! ANYTHING BUT THAT!
<br />
<br />Then stop trying to order me to do stuff!
<br />
<br />Tekagi: Yes, sir. Anything you say, sir.
<br />
<br />Much better. (Continues with story)
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: The artifact must be destroyed! (Launches a torpedo)
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: The Nomads will prevail once again! (Launches a torpedo)
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: DIE PATHETIC HUMANS! DIE! MWAHAHAHA! (Launches every torpedo in his ship)
<br />
<br />And as you all know, Freeport 7 exploded. Also, Nomad 3&#8217;s psychotic episode suddenly ended. 
<br />
<br />Nomad 1: You know, Mission Control won&#8217;t be too happy about you launching all of your torpedoes. You&#8217;ll have to pay for them yourself.
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: What do you mean? I was insane then! Besides, I had to use them to blow up the station!
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: No, you only had to use one.
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: Why?
<br />
<br />Nomad 2: The station was sucked into the Cutscene Zone.
<br />
<br />Nomad 3: Crap, how could I have forgotten about that even when I was insane?
<br />
<br />If you didn&#8217;t know, the Cutscene Zone is a well-known phenomenon that (obviously) occurs during cutscenes in video games (especially in Freelancer) and tends to suck things in. Anything sucked into it becomes highly explosive and has its armor reduced by 90%. In Freelancer, capital ships are the most common victims, but it can happen to anything. Anyway, enough with the Freeport 7 scene. It kind of dragged on a bit longer than I wanted it to.
<br />
<br />PLANET MANHATTAN
<br />
<br />Trent: (Walks into the bar and is watching the TV)
<br />
<br />TV: It&#8217;s not known if Freeport 7&#8217;s destruction was accidental or a deliberate attack, but the LSF says it suspects a dangerous criminal organization, &#8220;The Order&#8221;.
<br />
<br />Trent: Yeah, of course it was the Order, especially since it was NOMAD torpedoes that hit the station!
<br />
<br />You&#8217;re not supposed to know about them!
<br />
<br />Trent: Oh, yeah. (Walks up to the bartender) A Sidewinder Fang, please.
<br />
<br />Bartender: All we have is Liberty Ale.
<br />
<br />Trent: Fine.
<br />
<br />Bartender: Hey, I saw your face on the news. You&#8217;re one of the Freeport 7 survivors. Blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah. If you&#8217;re looking for a job, talk to the girl over there. Her name is Jun&#8217;ko Zane. She works for the LSF.
<br />
<br />Trent walked over to Juni and spoke to her in his usual, very eloquent manner of speech.
<br />
<br />Trent: Hey, whatcha got?
<br />
<br />Juni: (slaps him) PERVERT!
<br />
<br />Trent: Ow, I didn&#8217;t mean it that way!
<br />
<br />Juni: What, were you looking for work or something?
<br />
<br />Trent: Yes! My name&#8217;s Trent and I need some money!
<br />
<br />Juni: Well, I could use a good freelancer, Trent. Ok, I have a mission for you. You&#8217;ll just have to escort a convoy of food and medical supplies to Pittsburgh. Sound good?
<br />
<br />Trent: No, I want something more exciting.
<br />
<br />Juni: Please?
<br />
<br />Trent: No.
<br />
<br />Juni: Please?
<br />
<br />Trent: No.
<br />
<br />Juni: Please?
<br />
<br />Trent: NO!
<br />
<br />Juni: Ok, I&#8217;ll get a ship for you. We&#8217;ll leave as soon as you&#8217;re ready.
<br />
<br />Trent: &gt;_&lt;

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 3: Of Flying Donuts and Crappy Pilots </b>
<br />
<br />Trent had no problems getting into space in his new piece-of-crap Starflier, except when a leaf blew into it, severely damaging the ship. Trent was forced to use his entire load of nanobots to keep the thing from exploding. But when he came out of the docking ring, the Battleship Osiris was just sitting out there in plain sight. There was smoke pouring out of it and there were many huge blast marks on its hull.
<br />
<br />Orillion: Are you sure we&#8217;re cloaked?
<br />
<br />Von Claussen: Well, the ship&#8217;s computer says we are.
<br />
<br />Orillion: Well, I wouldn&#8217;t trust a computer after the incident with the EMP.
<br />
<br />Random LPI Pilot: This is Liberty Police Delta-3 to Battleship Osiris; I&#8217;m scanning your cargo for contraband.
<br />
<br />Orillion: OH #$*%! WE&#8217;RE NOT CLOAKED! HIT THE RED BUTTON NOW!
<br />
<br />Guy at controls: Which red button? There <i>is </i> no red button!
<br />
<br />Random LPI Pilot: You&#8217;ve got nothing here I&#8217;m looking for. (Flies off)
<br />
<br />Orillion: (Walks over to the control panel) This one! (Presses a large red button clearly marked &#8220;CLOAK&#8221;, which is right next to an even larger green button labeled &#8220;CAPPUCINO&#8221; )
<br />
<br />The Battleship Osiris suddenly disappeared, causing more than one pilot in the area to question his sanity.
<br />
<br />Trent then found King in space, ready to do the mission and then get back to Leeds.
<br />
<br />King: You must be Trent. I&#8217;m King, the CO of this mission.
<br />
<br />Trent: Hey, shouldn&#8217;t you at least have a heavy fighter if you&#8217;re a CO?
<br />
<br />King: It wouldn&#8217;t matter if I had a freaking battleship; it&#8217;d still only have a few class 1 weapons since this is the first mission.
<br />
<br />Trent then saw a very weird ship flying towards Newark Station. It looked like a huge donut covered in chocolate sprinkles.
<br />
<br />Trent: What the heck is that?!
<br />
<br />King: That&#8217;s the Donut, Admiral Schultsky&#8217;s flagship. He&#8217;s visiting Manhattan to open the first of Rheinland&#8217;s famous Schultsky&#8217;s Donuts shops in Liberty. Even President Jacobi will be at the opening ceremony. Keep your distance from it, as he will NOT like it if you blow off one of the chocolate sprinkles.
<br />
<br />Schultsky: Newark, this is RNC Donut, requesting permission to dock with your station.
<br />
<br />Newark: You can dock if you give me a free box of your donuts.
<br />
<br />Schultsky: Or I could just use the mooring fixture.
<br />
<br />Newark: Donut, be advised, we&#8217;re picking up unknown contacts.
<br />
<br />Schultsky: Affirmative. Power up weapons! Unknown ships, this is the RNC Donut. Alter course at once or we will open fire!
<br />
<br />Suddenly, the Donut was sucked into the Cutscene Zone. About the same time, the Order pilots launched their torpedoes. Fortunately for everyone except the Order ships, the Donut was using a new countermeasure launcher for capital ships, which caused most of the torpedoes to miss. However, one of them hit the top of the ship, blowing off several of the chocolate sprinkles.
<br />
<br />Schultsky: You did NOT just do that&#8230;
<br />
<br />King: Take cover! (Flies behind Newark Station)
<br />
<br />Everyone in the area (except the Order ships) immediately flew behind something, whether it was a station, docking ring, or planet.
<br />
<br />Schultsky: DIE!!
<br />
<br />Suddenly, an awful lot of rather large guns popped out of hidden compartments in the Donut&#8217;s hull and destroyed the Order ships in seconds. Because again fortunately for everyone except the Order, the Order had not launched Anubi to destroy the Donut, but some obscure thing called the Order Ship, a piece of crap that has less than half the armor of an Anubis and can only carry class 1 weapons and shields. It&#8217;s only redeeming quality was that it could carry torpedoes.
<br />
<br />Orillion: I never thought those would work anyways. We&#8217;ll just have to kill &#8216;em ourselves.
<br />
<br />The Osiris then decloaked right next to the Donut and fired a laser blast from the one remaining turret on it. The Donut failed to explode instantly, as it was no longer in the Cutscene Zone. The Osiris recloaked and flew off, causing even more people in the area to question their sanity.
<br />
<br />King: O_O We better get to the transport now.
<br />
<br />If you were wondering what happened to the Osiris, it wasn&#8217;t that the guy hit the wrong button and uncloaked the ship instead of making a cappuccino, as that would be too unoriginal. What really happened was that they flew by the weapons testing facility in Alaska on their way to Manhattan. What they didn&#8217;t know was that the Liberty Navy was, at that exact time, testing out a new experimental EMP device that would drain the energy from all ships in a 5,000 meter radius. They were intending to use this to make a new EMP missile. And as the Laws of Comedy dictate, the Osiris just happened to be passing by as they activated the EMP. Even worse, there was a group of fighters standing by, waiting to test out their new Sunslayer Torpedoes. Needless to say, the Osiris was heavily damaged, and only managed to escape when the torpedo ammo spontaneously exploded in someone&#8217;s cargo bay, causing all the fighters to immediately jettison their torps and switch to the weaker energy-based weapons, which gave the Osiris enough time to recloak and get away.
<br />
<br />FORT BUSH
<br />
<br />King: USV Brandt, are you ready to go?
<br />
<br />USV Brandt: DUH, you&#8217;re only 12 hours late!
<br />
<br />King: I said 4 P.M., not 4 A.M.
<br />
<br />USV Brandt: Oh.
<br />
<br />King: Well, let&#8217;s just get in the tradelane.
<br />
<br />(In the tradelane)
<br />
<br />King: Looking good so far&#8230;
<br />
<br />*Tradelane Disrupted*
<br />
<br />King: D&#8217;OH!
<br />
<br />Liberty Rogue 1: Give up your cargo or-(Flies into an asteroid and explodes)
<br />
<br />USV Brandt: Well, since all you have is class 1 lasers, no.
<br />
<br />Rogue 2: Then di-(Crashes into Rogue 3 and explodes)
<br />
<br />The battle ended in seconds, because the Rogues in Mission 1 are such crappy pilots and they all died from hitting asteroids or each other. Yes, I know that hitting an asteroid or another ship doesn&#8217;t blow you up, but right now, let&#8217;s just say it does.
<br />
<br />The mission then went on as you all know; Trent and King saved the XT-19 Prison Ship, mainly because half the Rogues there crashed into Maine. Then they saved Beta 4, and torpedoed the Rogue base into oblivion. Trent then got his money and used it to buy some better equipment. Then he took off to go back to Manhattan when&#8230;
<br />
<br />King: Fort Bush is under attack! Can you help defend it?
<br />
<br />Trent: Nah, don&#8217;t have time.
<br />
<br />King: I&#8217;ll give you $8,000 if you do, which is enough for a better ship.
<br />
<br />Trent: EDISON TRENT TO THE RESCUE!
