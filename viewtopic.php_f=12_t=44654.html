			<div class="content">well, that's very true, we must never forget; it was truly awful, I for one could hardly believe what I was seeing, and in some ways it still seems so incredible it's like some horrible dream, that one day we'll all wake up and it won't have happened and the world took a different course. And it's spawned in it's wake more horrors - the world certainly is not the same, things have just got worse, not better.
<br />
<br />I still think quite often about the people who were trapped above the fires, who had to make the choice between burning to death or jumping to their deaths, yet with several hours to go in which they knew they'd never see their families again. Isn't it incredible how much of that imagery was edited out of mainstream news broadcasts? We could cope with watching a building collapse, but not a man falling to his death? Surely it's the deaths that were the tragedy, not the buildings? I see by the way that the identity of the &quot;falling man&quot; was finally established...
<br />
<br />Some of our members here were eye-witnesses to the events of that day, some of us have been to the site and know people who lived through it, and all of us in some ways in some ways live with consequences of what happened, some more than others. I've paid my respects in New York, in the vast empty space where there were once huge towers; please if you wish pay your respects here, but out of consideration for the dead and our own rules at TLR, keep it decent. We've had flaming before in Sept 11th threads and it's terribly disrespectful, you know.</div>

			<div class="content">I still remember 9/11 like it was yesterday. My neigbhor (pretty sure I spelled that wrong) and good friend was on the plane that hit the Pentagon. I knew he would be out of town for a good while, so it wasn't until about a month after the attack that I found out. 
<br />
<br />But I remember, on that day I was in the hospital in downtown Atlanta just about to get a test done on my heart when I saw the doctor's jaw drop. There was a barely audible radio in the room, and he looked at my mother after she asked what was wrong, and he told her that a plane had just hit the World Trade Center. I remember thinking it must have been some kind of computer problem because planes are supposed to be flying high enough to avoid skyscrapers. After they finished the test and we were getting ready to leave, as I walked out into the waiting room, I saw on the TV another plane crashing into the second tower. That's when I thought &quot;My God, we're at war.&quot; Of course, a little while after that we'd made it home and then I found out that another plane had hit the Pentagon, and that another one had dissapeared, which I later learned to be United 93. 
<br />
<br />It was almost eerie the next few days, as I'm used to hearing planes all the time, but there was this silence, and it was wierd. If I had a way to get to New York City and visit Ground Zero, I would. If I could make it to DC right now, I'd go to the memorial at the Pentagon. It was just wierd adjusting to the change. All my life I had known New York City by two famous landmarks; the Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Center. After I heard about the first plane I thought &quot;how long is it going to take them to repair the damage?&quot; (At this time I was still thinking it was a Cessna or a small plane like that.) I never would have thought that three hours later two American landmarks in two different cities would be the worst tragities the United States had ever seen.
<br />
<br />It just doesn't seem like it's been five years. There are plenty of political things I could be ranting about right now, but I just won't. This isn't the place or the time for that.</div>

			<div class="content">This summer I got a chance to go to New York and see the Ground Zero site (it's just a huge pit now, but the sheer size of it is awe-inspiring) and I got to meet two people who were there on that day (one was in Tower 2 when it happened).  Their stories were incredible, as it's the kinda stuff that the news and Hollywood can never describe.  Just being there put it all into persepctive, made it seem all the more real to me.  
<br />
<br />Also, my uncle was in the Pentagon on that day as well.  He was at the time working at the Department of Defense (he was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Resources and Plans division, and thus was very close to Rumsfeld's office) and so he was on the opposite side of the building when the plane hit.  Still, he heard and felt it when it happened, and I got a chance to talk to him about it some this summer.  He knew a couple of the people who died that day.  
<br />
<br />Anyways, it is very important to me to remember what happened that day, and do everything we can to prevent it from happening again (whatever that may be).  
<br />
<br />(Also, for anyone who's interested, I saw that United 93 movie over the weekend, and it was a very, very good movie.  It was very apolitical, and really did an excellent job of capturing the events of the day and specifically the heroic actions of those on that plane with a minimum of fictionalization.)</div>

<br />And the more emotional aspect my little friend, is you didn't lose someone, so it means less o you, but if it was your Father, or brother that died, this day would serve to drive home the loss, that they are never coming back.

			<div class="content">On the other hand, since I firmly believe in NO gods, sure. I admit it was a horrific attack, but the way America dealt with it was completely wrong, by maintaining a constant state of emergency, I have come to think, with sorrow, that America is rapidly becoming a state like Germany in the 20s 30s and 40s (ie. Nazi Germany). Just think about it. Swap Hitler for Bush, Auschwitz for Guantanamo, and Goebbels for Bush's party, and there you have it! Another thing which demonstrates this is the new law on war criminals, which means they will no longer be treated like the humans they are in your country. (BTW I am not a radical Muslim, just a simple Irishman who, like many of his countrymen, is enraged at America's sending planes through Shannon 
<br />which is a complete breach of our Neutrality! However, that is our government's fault, not yours) I know this is causing a storm, but this is just the opinion which I, as a human, am entitled to.
