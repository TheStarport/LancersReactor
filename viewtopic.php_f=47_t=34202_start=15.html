			<div class="content">Name:Chuck &quot;hothead&quot; Reed
<br />Ship:Stiletto
<br />Faction:Freelancer
<br />Location:Yanagi Depot
<br />
<br />Chuck docked to Yanagi. His ship's cockpit was sweatty and smelled badly. Chuck climed out of the cockpit. His ship was badly damaged and there were marks and burns done by lasers and missiles all over. He walked to the equipment dealer and said:
<br />&quot;I need you to fix my ship as soon as possible&quot;
<br />The dealer replied:&quot;You know, it's quite badly damaged, it's gonna take some time and money&quot;
<br />-&quot;Just get my bird fixed okay. &quot;
<br />
<br />Before dealer had a chance to reply Chuck walked to the bar. He was tired, he needed a drink, then a shower and some sleep. He walked inside. There was a group of Outcasts in the corner table and lots of Junkers. Chuck walked to bartender and said:
<br />&quot;Give me something strong&quot;
<br />-&quot;How strong?&quot;
<br />-&quot;Strongest stuff you got&quot;
<br />-&quot;I'm sorry we don't sell Cardamine. But try those Outcasts they have some&quot;
<br />-&quot;I meant BOOZE not cardamine you moron&quot;
<br />-&quot;All right here you are. Strongest stuff we have&quot;
<br />
<br />Chuck took the bottle and sat down to a table. As he drank his drink he memorized what had happened during last days. He had met a disgruntled Daumann pilot in Hawaii. The pilot had told him that Daumann were planning a secret diamond shipment from Dredsen. Chuck had gone in...and walked to a trap. As soon as he intercepted the transport, a bounty hunter patrol came in guns blazing. The Daumann man had set up a trap for him. Chuck managed to kill three of the Hunters and fled to New Berlin, after which he had to kill two police officers trying to stop him. Now he was running from the law, with Hunters, Daumann and Rheinland on his tail.
<br />
<br />Chuck thought what to do now, all money he had would go to getting his ship to flyable condition, which meant he needed money desperately. Maybe he would salvage some equipment from the wrecks the nebula and sell them to someone. After his ship would be in a decent condition and he had taken some rest he would hunt down the Daumann man who had set a trap for him and show him that no one messes with Chuck Reed and gets away with it...
<br />
<br />OOC:Not ready. I'll finish this later. My character is a former Liberty Navy member who got kicked out because of disciplinary reasons and ended up being a criminal. I dunno if this is good but english ain't my national language so that's why there may be writing errors

			<div class="content">Name: Johnathan Faires
<br />Ship: Humpback
<br />Location: Planet New Berlin
<br />Credits: 0 
<br />Faction: ALG Waste Disposal
<br />
<br />The memory flashed through his mind, he had been jumped out side of the Commodity dealer by a bunch of thugs who demanded that he transfer all of his credits to them or die. He shook his head, there were many things he could have done different, but still, he couldn't think of them. 
<br />
<br />But not only had they taken his credits, but his ship as well. His beloved humpback, how he missed it so. He thought for a moment, the only job he could get that would him another ship was ALG Waste Disposal. He thought long and hard on this, and then deciding he had nothing to lose, walked up to the home office and applied for an escort fighter. He still wanted to be a merchant again, but he just couldn't afford another freighter, not to mention the cargo. He would have to work for them for at least a year to even get enough for a new humpback. Because he didn't pay attention in school, his life was going down the drain, just like ALG's waste......

			<div class="content">Colony News Service Report:
<br />
<br />PLANET NEW TOKYO - In the far aftermath of the short three-day war between Kusari and Rheinland, Shogun Edo called a meeting with his KNF admirals today.  After a short 20-minute conference, Edo came out of the closed-door session and announced that diplomatic relations would begin to open in order to form an open alliance with the Gas Miners Guild.
<br />
<br />After Rheinland's sudden offensive into Kusari space caught the KNF off guard, H-Fuel supplies for the Kusari Naval Forces has become dangerously low as their fleets have been expanded. 
<br />&quot;There's simply not enough supply to meet the demand,&quot; Admiral Mamoru Shingua stated after the conference.  &quot;This will hopefully allow us to increase our trade with the GMG at a much more efficient pace, as well as price.&quot;
<br />
<br />No word yet on responses from the GMG or Rheinland.  It's safe to assume though that Rheinland will meet this idea with great resistance.</div>

<br />[Well Leion, you seem to have pissed of a lot of people to day so what are you goning to do now/i
<br />Leion was hiding in a venterlating shafed when his neurtal net beep loudly
<br />&quot;Oh-ho&quot;
<br />&quot;He is in the venterlation&quot; a guy yelled
<br />&quot;damn it&quot;
<br />Leion started to crawl very fast as shots started to hit were he was hiding
<br />Infact he was crawling so fast that he didn't see the vent go into a verical drop
<br />Next thing he knew was that he was falling very very fast.
<br />Why do I always get the bad luck
<br />Then luckly he landed on top of an IMG guard, killing him instancly.
<br />&quot;Ok that is the last time I hide in a ventlation system&quot; Leion said. He tryed to stand but his leg gave away.
<br />Leion, well done you just broke your leg in an IMG base that is after your head what are you going to do now
<br />As he got up (putting his weight on his good leg) he sore a sign 
<br />Hanger 7
<br />&quot;YES&quot; Leion yelled. His Dagger was in this hanger.
<br />'He's this way!
<br />&quot;Damn it&quot;
<br />Leion started to hop madly towards his ship.
<br />At lest 10 men entered the hanger as Leion was climbing into his Dagger.
<br />They opened fire just as Leion closed the cockpit window. Leion was just starting the engene whan he sore a guy with a man portable Slingshot missle launcher stager in to the hanger with the weapon on his shoulder.
<br />The Daggers engene gave a huge roar as they fully started up.
<br />&quot;Sheilds actorvated&quot; chimed the computer
<br />The guy with the lancher fired.
<br />And hit the Dagger bringing it's bearly formed shield down.
<br />Leion didn't miss a beat 
<br />He put his dagger on it's tail and launch two moonstakers at the first airlock.
<br />Leion move the dagger thought the newly created hole just as the guy fired another rocket it missing the dagger buy a metre.
<br />The Dagger got to the top and Leion levled off then keyed his mike.
<br />&quot;Never piss off a Freelancer&quot;
<br />Then he blew open the last airlock.

<br />
<br />&quot;i thought you could use a hand&quot; said Robert
<br />
<br />he trailed the reamining Falcon and let loose his barragers at the flacon exloded into a fine dust.  Beep, Beep, Beep, Incoming missiles.
<br />
<br />Robert Dropped a Countermeasure/mine Combo he had cooked up hiself in his cargo bay a few months ago.
<br />
<br />&quot;I hope this works&quot; said robert as he let lose 3 of the countermeasure/Mine combo.
<br />
<br />the mine split into tiny shards that magnetized onto the 3 incoming missiles.  The the Sharps proceded to lock a tractor beam onto the hawk behind me and the 3 missiles hit the hawk at the same time and the hawk exploded.
<br />
<br />&quot;one more i said&quot;  but before i could get a reading on the enemy ship it exploded into a fireball bluer than the clouds around us.
<br />
<br />The Outcast thanked me and moved on his way.
<br />
<br />I then proceded to scourge the former space station.  I called back to yanagi and told them what had happened and they sent a wing of CSV's to help me out.</div>

<br />It was another routine mission, check all the Gas miners in Sigma 13.
<br />He hated it. 
<br />He also didnt like his ship very much and was hoping to get a falcon soon, and then an eagle. He was watching his partner, Mitch, designated Omega 14-7, Examine the charts from inside the Gas miner.
<br />&quot;Charts show optimum efficency&quot;
<br />&quot;WARNING. Incoming torpedo salvo, 2 klicks and closing.&quot; Cried the never flinching voice of the NavComputer.
<br />&quot;What the hel-&quot;
<br />&quot;No questions! To the hangar!&quot;
<br />
<br />They undocked just as 3 starkillers impacted on the intake vents igniting the gases. He scanned the hostile ships.
<br />
<br />A CSV....and a bloodhound. Junkers.
<br />&quot;Why the hell are junkers attacking us?&quot; I asked
<br />&quot;Never mind that just break and engage!&quot;
<br />The junker's weapons were extremely powerful, nearly hitting us with torps and missiles. I shredded through one of them with my Skyblast a's and Sunblast b's. I watched Mitch nailed the other one with a Cannonball missile and it went up in a fiery explosion. 
<br />&quot;What....the....hell.&quot; He was just staring at the now crippled Gas Miner.
<br />&quot;Junkers have never attacked us before.&quot; I was still thinking about those weapons
<br />&quot;I know, lets head back to the Naha and report. I have half a mind to go torp Yanagi.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Colony News Service Report:
<br />
<br />PLANET NEW BERLIN - Newly elected Chancellor Goehring called a meeting with his top advisors earlier today in the wake of Kusari's decision to attempt open alliance negotiations with the Gas Miners Guild.  As expected by many, Rheinland's stance on the issue has become profound, and vehemently opposed to the idea of letting GMG &quot;arschlochs&quot;, as one advisor put it, become a directly active player in the economies of Sirius.
<br />
<br />&quot;One thing we're not sure of is who exactly Rheinland is opposing: the GMG or Kusari itself,&quot; said Cambridge University political science chairman Edwin Streyhan.  &quot;It's likely that their policies are shifting towards a more overt anti-GMG stance, but that isn't exactly the biggest surprise.  We know that there's still bad blood between Rheinland and the GMG after the 80-Years War, and it's unlikely to clear up anytime soon.  What's most fascinating now is that there's more resentment between Rheinland and Kusari in the wake of the brief war spurned by Chancellor Niemann's mental breakdown, and that may bring about long-term ramifications to whether the two Houses can achieve total closure in the near future.&quot;
<br />
<br />By all rights, Liberty President Barbara Jacobi was informed earlier today by her advisors of the statements made by both the GMG and Rheinland.  When asked about Liberty's official position in the matter, Jacobi responded with lukewarm admiration for the GMG's willingness to hear Kusari's offer.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm pleased that an organization such as the GMG has agreed to meet with Kusari's officials to discuss an open alliance,&quot; Jacobi stated at her press conference today.  &quot;Perhaps in the future, this can lead to greater business opportunities with the GMG and the other Houses of Sirius, even Rheinland perhaps.&quot;
<br />
<br />Queen Carina of Bretonia, who is currently on a state visit to Planet Manhattan was with President Jacobi at the press conference.  When asked her opinion, she responded in a very similar fashion, although she voiced concern that it's unlikely the GMG and Rheinland will find common ground anytime in the near future.
<br />
<br />As if in confirmation of the Bretonian ruler's statement, Chancellor Goehring was reported to have immediately called a session of the Reichstag, in hopes of putting together a resolution that would denounce any alliance the GMG would amke with any other organization in Sirius, be it governmental or otherwise.  Several members of both the Bretonian Parliament and Liberty Congress remarked that if Rheinland were to indeed interfere with Kusari affairs, the two Houses would be forced to respond in some manner.</div>
