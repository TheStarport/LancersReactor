			<div class="content">If your on a standard (unmodded) server, you'll start with a Starflier! DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CHALLENGE SOMEBODY WHO IS OBVIOUSLY HIGHER THAN YOU! That is suicide!
<br />
<br />Next, use your trading skills to raise money fast! I find the most cost-effective trade route is to buy Luxury Consumer Goods from Manhattan, and sell them on at Ainu Depot, Hokkaido. Then buy Cardamine, sell at Manhattan! Repeat, buy a Drone freighter from Kusari, and you're away! Once you've reached a couple of million credits or so (don't worry it doesn't take long) head to Omicron Theta, Freeport 9, and get a Corsair reputation hack, which will cost you no more than 150k. Take the Omicron Gamma Jump Hole in the South, and head to Planet Crete. Buy a Titan (or alternatively buy an Eagle from Freeport 9 while you were there), two Tizona del Cid pulse weapons, and four some Angelito Mk II or III (can't remeber which!) Take the Unknown Jump Hole in the north-east of the northern nebula, and destroy some Nomads, loot their Weapons, land on nearby Planet Primus (Shows up as a Samura base), repair your ship (if required), stock up on Nanobots and Shield Batteries, and then continue pummelling Nomads until you have enough firepower to take out a few Nomad patrols without having to use a Shield Battery.
<br />
<br />Next head to Planet Crete in Omicron Gamma. Take a few high-paying missions (namely 245k missions) and just get rich! If and when you get bored of this, which happens often, message somebody in a nearby system using the Chat Window, and do missions together. You split the earnings, but the missions go a lot quicker, so in the long run, more hands make less work!
<br />
<br />If this gets too boring, go back to trading, helping out noobs by giving them cash to escort you whilst trading, and the like. You will quickly become a well recognized player, who noobs will message for help.
<br />
<br />Then if this gets too tedious, join a clan!

			<div class="content">I'll offer up an alternative route...relatively easy to pull off, with a different ship(s) as an end result.
<br />
<br />Go to a point midway between Norfolk and Baltimore shipyards, and begin hacking tradelanes. Scan every transport that comes out of the lane, and take the cargo of whichever one is carrying the most expensive loot. Sell it at your location of choice. Lather, rinse, repeat. The starflier escorts should be little trouble, even if you're in the starflier as well. Keep doing this until you are neutral with the rogues, hackers, and outcasts, and have a sizeable bank account. This may take longer, but it gives you the slight advantage of not having to trek halfway across the sector to make your dropoffs; all this can be done in New York, and is very nice since the money-making piracy will also improve your rep with the factions you will be going to later on.
<br />
<br />Now you can go one of three ways. The first is to return to Manhattan, buy a Patriot, and go romping around in that(or just stay in the Starflier). The second is to head up to Kusari space and buy a Drake, which most LF pilots will probably choose. The third is to go to Mactan in Magellan, and get a Dromedary(try to take some H-Fuel with you, for extra profits). Either way, you should make sure to visit Rochester(junker base) to buy at least an Imp. CM dropper and a heavy thruster(advanced is nice, but not really necessary). Once you have your ship, take the Tau-37 route to Omicron Alpha, which should be a safe zone for you(you didn't piss off the BHG, right?), as both hunters and outcasts are neutral. 
<br />
<br />The first thing you should do is check the Viking wreck(by the Hispania) to see if it has its loot; it may or may not depending on who else is playing. If not, grab a big pocketfull of cardamine from Malta, and go sell it back on Manhattan(or either Buffalo or Rochester, if the cops hate you/ you don't want to be scanned). Now go back again and equip your ship with the best weapons the outcasts have to offer for your ship class, including the highest-level mine launcher(ripper, if you can get to one of the wrecked outcast ships near the unknown jumphole) and cruise disrupter. 
<br />

<br />&quot;Although I do not consider myself a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, I find that their goals and mine often follow the same path. I will aid them when I can...if they give me a percentage of the salvage from whatever they frag along the way. But god help them if someone puts a bounty on THEIR heads, for I don't care who I hunt for, as long as their live capture(or untimely death) can get me enough credits to buy a decent sized mug of my favorite drink.&quot;- A Freelance Bounty Hunter.
