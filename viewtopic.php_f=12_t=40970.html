			<div class="content">In military circles, a wing will fly the &quot;Missing Man Formation.&quot; When one of thier own is no longer with them and died doing thier duty. It is a fitting tribute. Lately, it seems we as a community have seen some die and some simple &quot;missing&quot; from active posting. Some have come out of the shadows briefly, and some have come back and it is understandable that with Real life, comes  priorities that prevent returns. 
<br />
<br />Bottom line, I have been thinking of one of our own who is no longer with us. <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/warlordbob/' Target=_Blank>Warlord Bob</a>. We lose people and have to go on with life, but I can't help but think we would ever forget them. This thread is for those lost, and for those out there that have not returned to post. We don't always know how they are doing or anything else. 
<br />
<br />This thread, hopefully will help us remeber those we lost, and draw closer to those we still have and never let us forget. For those in the shadows, come on back in to the light and let us know how you are doing. Feel free to post about a friend lost if you wish, or a message to a member not seen from in a long time. Maybe we can encourage them back to the forums. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

We used to play LAN games together with mini-Taw.

			<div class="content">Hi everybody, it's been awhile.  
<br />Warlord Bob will definitely be missed.  
<br />I'm taking care of the shipping department now where I work (temporarily) and have a few free minutes for break.  Since I last visited I've transferred out of the equipment testing area to being the general floater in the warehouse and taking care of anything that need doing.  This instantly lowered my stress level dramatically and was more interesting besides.  Sometimes I take over in shipping and can then surf on lunch (usually I have stuff that I need to look up though) and breaks.  Not much otherwise has changed for me though, except a few new games.  Oh, and one tip, don't leave breath mints in the car where they will be heated and cooled repeatedly.  I broke a molar on one. *cough* Dentyne Ice *cough* Fortunately it didn't go to the nerve so I didn't need a root canal, but still. I just figured I'd stop in, say hi, and check on everybody.  After all, you did ask for those who had not checked in for a while to check in.  Hopefully I can talk again sometime soon.  Bye.
<br />
<br />BTW the tumor in my head's just about gone and can't be seen in the MRI so thing are still looking up in that department.
<br />
<br />I did try to start my own thread instead of adding into this one but couldn't for some reason.  The problem is likely on my end so don't worry about it.
<br />
<br />The SpaceNuts always return.

			<h3><a href="#p409551" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Hi all,
<br />
<br />Today I said goodbye to my best friend.. a Rottweiler named Kirra a who has been my almost constant companion for the last few years and while this may not be the appropriate spot to place it.. I would like to I think she more than qualifies as a 'wingman'
<br />
<br />Many of you here know me as a shipwright and mod maker.. she was my helper and the girl who sat beside my chair many times as I played Freelancer.. and who would get concerned and nudge me when I was ranting at the screen as while testing stuff I would get my arse handed to me on a plate. Or she may just simply just appear at my side and place her head between the arm of the chair and my lap just so I could tickle her nose or behind her ears.. She gave more love than she ever asked for.
<br />
<br />She was a fun loving boisterous dog with not a nasty bone in her body, tho she was very protective of my daughter Jenna and when Jenna was young was careful and gentle in play and they became fast best buddies and until her latter days the call of &quot;you're it!&quot; would have her up and into the game of ''hey you are on the other side of the table, and I'm on this side.. &quot;now how to fix this...?&quot; .. or by the fire and teasing her with the 'walking fingers' as she lay by the fire dozing,, apparently asleep the nose would wrinkle and a guttural growl would rumble forth, as the fingers got closer she would be very still, growling softly then suddenly leap at the offending 'creature' that disturbed her rest.. My daughter and Kirra played this game a lot, with squeals and laughter as the fingers were 'attacked', barking and growling as they were hurriedly removed.. but in all that time not a patch of skin was removed as those jaws that could crack heavy bone would hold as gently as a feather. tho they could always remind of the power she could bring.. mainly when playing with me.. the game went up a notch then and she got a bit more 'serious' but she was never too rough and a word could cease it.. 
<br />
<br />Then there was the time she fell through the floor.....it was when we were building the extension.. they had the roof on and the frame done.. and Kirra was up the back yard being an idiot.. as only dogs can be, anyhow I walked out the old back door.. or where it had been.. and we had a couple of pallets as steps and a plank that went across them and another wooden frame that made a step up to the back area.. The back of the house goes up three steps and there were planks across the joists that made a path, as the floorboards had not been laid. At the back of the house we were making a porch with all the rubble from the kitchen..and a chimney - like most building sites all uneven steps and temporary 'paths' made up of planks.. and at the very back a plank leading across this rubble to the backyard..Anyhow she spots me.. and decides I need a suitable 'enthusiastic' - &quot;hey dad life is pure bliss&quot; greeting, and comes haring down the back yard full tilt (and for a big dog she was very fast over about 10 yards), she hit the plank running.. leapt the porch.. and came screaming over the ..- ooops the floor is missing... - she made it about halfway trying for the joists.. then disappeared between the joists.. the look on her face was priceless..as she disappeared it was; &quot;help!&quot;, &quot;Why me?,&quot; &quot;oh bugger this is gunna hurt..&quot; all in one glance. Luckily she only fell about 4 feet but she bruised herself pretty well.. of course I went to her as fast as I could and as I looked down she looked up,, pain and an expression like resignation in her eyes.. it was as if she was saying &quot; **** that hurt.. why me..?&quot; then she limped off.. half an hour later .. right as rain.. tho she used the planks and a steady gait after that..
<br />
<br />She loved the car and played &quot;designated driver&quot; when left to 'look after it', a job she took seriously but very quietly.. Rotty's are like that .. calm and steady .. reliable..
<br />
<br />In late summer this year, (I'm in Australia - so for those in the northern hemisphere.. February/March..) she started to sneeze.. but otherwise seemed unaffected. except it didn't go away, so it was off to the vet.. now she had had hayfever before and it was that dusty time of the year so the vet gave her some drugs to treat it and the problem seemed to go away.. then it came back, so it was off to the vet again more tests, an x-ray, a nose flush.. and for a while.. she was fine.. then it came back.. so a culture, blood tests etc.. it seemed to be an infection that the cultures identified as resistant to some antibiotics and not others so .. we tried the others.. and for a while it was okay again..then it came back,, in all this time I watched as she became first an old dog then a shadow of what she was..it was heartbreaking.. she fought.. tooth and nail.. she took her pills,, she tried to get better but somehow the best that we have today was not enough.. her age was also a factor .. but she fought it.. 
<br />
<br />Kirra passed on this morning, she was loosing the fight with the nasty she had picked up, and according to the vet she probably contracted pneumonia at the last.. The decline was rapid and shocking and finally we had no choice but to end her suffering, so this morning we took her to the Vet for the final time.. She would not enter the surgery and weak as she was wanted to go outside.. thinking she may want to relieve herself I took her outside where she lay down under a tree where the vet put her to sleep for the final time.. She was very sick and I think that she chose the spot.. funnily it was under a Norfolk Island Pine.. these trees only grow on the very edge of the coast normally and to find one in the Vet's yard is very unusual. We were reminded of very happy times on holidays to one of our favourite spots, these trees also stand on the edge of the camping ground that borders a huge tidal sandflat and the last time we camped there for holidays we camped under one of these trees.. strange and somehow very fitting.. If death is ever fitting. 
<br />
<br />She lived for 11 years, 1 month and 17 days.
<br />
<br />Harrier
<br />
<br />to pinch and change a quote slightly:
<br />
<br />&quot;Next time you see a shooting star.. keep it in your heart, it is the soul of someone that reached the goal of giving others her love..&quot; 
<br />
<br />not a problem for dogs, they do it so well.
<br />
<br />If there are no dogs in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went.
<br />-Will Rogers
<br />
<br />We give dogs time we can spare, space we can spare and love we can spare. And in return, dogs give us their all. It's the best deal man has ever made.

			<div class="content">My condolences Harrier. I know how you feel, I have had a number of dogs myself and putting them down is hard to do. My previous dog had bone cancer, and couldn't walk without crying, so we did the only thing that we could. *Sigh* 
<br />
<br />As for my current dog, she was given to us by a previous owner, and she has relatively severe arthritis. Sometimes she takes a turn for the worst and will hardly move for a day or so, but she always seems to bounce back and trot around happily the next day. It's quite odd actually.
