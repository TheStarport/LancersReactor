			<div class="content">I think the Coallition has probably calmed down now and has most likely been expanding outside the Terran System (I refuse to refer to our system as the Solar System) Most likely they will eventually make contact with Sirius and that will most likely explain an expansion pack/sequel sudden incredibly more massive universe (most likely doubling the number of system in order to keep players occupied) And my prior thing about Dom Kavash vs Humans was meant to be something for you to avert and mabye see a few instances where human fleets are completely aniliated, I personally would like to see the Dom Kavash and Humans ally and start sharing technology (I'm sure the Dom Kavash even though they have their massive inteligence and civilization could learn something from us). Perhaps the trouble could also start out like Endless Waltz, an unfinished end comes back to haunt you. But I'd have to say that for the sequel the villians will return as the Nomads since the ending says that the Nomads arn't fully dealt with yet, I personaly though to see these words go across my screen: The End?

			<h3><a href="#p122854" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Regarding long memories: look what a furor was caused by the infamous &quot;crusade&quot; remark. That (series of) conflict(s) was centuries ago. &lt;g&gt;
<br />
<br />But RL politics aside, and thinking of possible sequel story lines, it appears that the Dom Kavash left long ago, leaving their &quot;watch dogs&quot; the Nomads behind.  Why, exactly, doesn't seem entirely clear.  Did they intend to come back but were unable to?  Were they wiped out somewhere among the far stars?  And why did they leave?  Maybe they ran away from something (that might appear to challenge Sirius)? Perhaps they were chased away and followed, and maybe they'll return, perhaps with whatever scared them still yapping at their heels?
<br />
<br />The Dom Kavash seem to have left that Dyson Sphere as a kind of kennel for their watch dogs...imagine what could scare a civilization that advanced. &lt;eg&gt;
<br />
<br />It might be interesting to see the Coalition (or whatever it has become in the intervening years) appear in Sirius space, perhaps with improved jump gate technology enabling really long jumps, found something far off that threatens all humans (maybe all mammals) regardless of politics. and are looking for their old Alliance enemies' help against an imminent invasion by a foe with whom they cannot deal alone: maybe the Dom Kavash coming back to exterminate the vermin who've taken over their old home systems, maybe whatever drove the Dom Kavash out has finally dealt with them--harshly--and is coming back to take possession of their abandoned territory and deal with the squatters.
<br />
<br />It might be interesting to see whether Sirius humans and Terran System humans could overcome old enmities and suspicion to deal with a threat to them all.  Could Sirius folks even believe that it's not just a &quot;Coalition&quot; ploy of some kind?  Might the humans not have to try to find a way to ally themselves with the Nomads, to enable learning enough of the Dom Kavash's technology to at least attempta defense against a really formidable mutual foe?  
<br />
<br />How hard would it be to get trust from the entirely alien Nomads, especially after what Trent and friends did to them, and when even now humans are hunting Nomads just to steal their weapons. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Just a thought, with a bit of inspiration from the Tar-Aiym krang and the Vom of flinx fame (and too many other SF stories and movies over a half century of reading/viewing).

			<div class="content">i agree....no wars.  Freelancer was built on an idea of trading, exploring and such...not on idea of Starlancer.
<br />
<br />what i would add to next Freelancer is....well quite a bit to mention it all.
<br />For starters, i would like some things made a little more complicated...a little more intersting....something thats for the techno and sci-fi fans and not just another game that &quot;appeals to a broader audience&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Add a little bit of star trek: bridge commander and a bit of Earth And Beyond components (i'm not talking about their crappy graphics <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) and this game could be the ULTIMATE SPACE SIMULATION.
<br />
<br />I want to be able to start my own faction, to be able to buy big trading ships, to be able to make my faction either a pirate or a manufacturer of something, or a trader or a builder which would then dictate what part of space and what system i set up in.
<br />Then to be able to build fleets, hire wingmen and other workers...perhaps be able to design your own uniqe weapons or ships and perhaps some pieces of thecnology that other factions don't have.
<br />I want to have conversation with Computer Controlled Players in game (like in Earth And Beyond) and be able to ask specific questions about movements of pirates and situations on planets and spacestations....and the same when we're in ships.
<br />
<br />Basically i wan the space to be more real...i want the programmers to spend more time using their imagination to add more components to this game and not worry about the fact that those additional details will be to complicated for general broader audience to comprehend...who cares about all others who don't like sci-fi and don't like technology and just want to fly around and look at pretty colors and effects...the true fans want MORE!....of course no offense to those that disagree and belong to the broader audience...it's just my opinion that's all.
<br />
<br />BTW have any of you played Morrowind???  BIG BIG and DETAILED (some would say complicated) game that didn't need to be massively multiplayer to be interesting....and to add to success, people didn't fear complexity, broad range of gamers bought the game (big sales) and enjoyed the long long long and interesting play full of twists and multiple outcomes and results of players actions....without need to force you to play on a server with thousands of other players paying 12 bucks a month.
<br />
<br />
<br />wooooow that was a load off....sorry for such a long post.</div>

			<div class="content">Great ideas about owning factions/bases partigiano.
<br />
<br />I have an addition to that faction-idea. It would be nice if the player could influence the balance of power between factions by running missions and general slaughter. This would make it impossible to improve your rep just by killing xenocs. At some point they would stop coming (and only rebuild slowly).</div>

			<div class="content">yes exactly...a little dynamic in the factions and the way you get them to like you.
<br />the AI should adapt to your way of doing things, and should change...Xenos if they notice they're being slaughtered, should stay away from you and you then have to find other ways to get Corsairs to like you...such as finding something to trade to some of their bases...of course that should mean some bases should be neutra even though they have Corsair influence.
<br />How about defending stations and battle ships???  I mean when some larger fleet of 10+ ships of a faction attack a station, station should be able to send out a distress call and you could reply to it and come and help...get good with a faction by doing this <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Or perhaps running a security fleet of your own, that protects an entire system...you set patrol routes, protect some space stations and such....get payed big bucks...eventually buy large vessels...battle cruisers and organize and army...or if not that, just get successfull with protection of stations and your reputation rises among freelancers and people of home planets so that they want to work for you and such.
<br />Heh maybe this is a bit too much but this is the dynamics i was talking about...not just one sided but multisided...many actions can have many results...a and on top of it all, AI adapts and changes....perhaps factions move out of certain areas and set up elsewhere....maybe AI makes it seem like you destroyed them all, but a convoy managed to get away and set up elsewhere...for this of course its necessary to create twice as many new and dynamic star systems.
<br />think of the possiblities <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  then again the company probably doesn't find this profitable...or at least finds it too much work for the money they get...all in all if they incorporate at least some of the aspects we mention here, it would only make the game BETTER!</div>
