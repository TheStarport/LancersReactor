			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p23094" class="post-subject">Cloak(I know its a sore Subject but an intriguing Idea)</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Like i said i dont mean to create trouble.  I along with other modders know its secrets and how to create it, like i said i know its sore, so i will not reveal any information regarding it.  also if this idea has been dicussed  i didnt know about it.
<br />
<br />My idea:
<br />
<br />When it came out, we had rogue modders using the cloak without regard to other players in mind.  We had several updates to it and then the Cloak detectors came out.  I know getting it to work was a Feat in itself, but i had an Idea.  Cloaks i think should be used in the game, BUT not without a counterpart.  Sure having them shoot weps with no damage is nice, But how about be able to buy a cloak Detector.  Now i realize that if you have the cloak available u can already see it, but what if we could change that all around and make it work Right.
<br />
<br />So modders could purchase a cloak and a cloak detector. Now i think that would make the game fair.   This is probably way outlandish seeing as it took us months to get the original cloak out, but i think its time again that we attempt to get it right.
<br />
<br />Anyone who feels they want to join in the effort just say so, i'm willing to work with only a few people and that being the more knowledgable one thats have been around a while, that being to keep it as secretive as possible, and not letting it get into the wrong hands as it once did before.  Also as added precaution if it were to be released it would be with that of an encryption, so it couldnt be opened and misused.

			<h3><a href="#p281750" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I think its not a bad idea. I personally have never seen it in MP - so i never felt the negative effects, but i know what it is about.
<br />i tried to mod it myself, but after a few attempts i gave up -&gt; i dont know how ur MP cloaks worked.
<br />however, if it is done in a controlled way, it would be a nice addon. cloak + anti-cloak is a fair deal. best would be a either-or mounting, not both.
<br />
<br />there is an encryption tool out there (sry i forgot the name who made it). -&gt; it can make sure that only the ones who encrypted it can read it. FL works with it but all ini readers will fail without the key. (i can look the person up @home)
<br />
<br />one thing that would be nice is to make it in modules:
<br />encrypt the critical part and leave the modders an interfact to it, where they can adjust the values (stats like energy usage and stuff) of it. this way it could be made that it does NOT shoot and cant be abused, but it would leave modders the freedom to integrate it into thir own mod without knowing the details of how it works.
<br />
<br />I offer my help on this. I know the FL-modding world pretty well and have a lot of modding experiance.
<br />I personally would like to see it work in the way i described it.

			<h3><a href="#p281765" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I've never really been one for MP player cloaks, even if other players had access to Anti-Cloak devices.
<br />
<br />What I've always preffered is encounter missions where you would go on an Encounter only to discover that the NPC's have it! Imagine, you get a sum to go to &quot;X&quot; and wipe out a &quot;few&quot; scum. You get there and lo and behold, you've suddenly got more than you bargained for when a Gunboat drops on you. Of course, scripting the mission commision to react to that hasn't been easy, but I think I'd preffer giving players an (enjoyable) sense of &quot;Oh Sh**!!!&quot; sort of zing to the game rather than a headache of wondering where the Munchkin Cloaked PK'ers are. 
<br />
<br />In short, I think that as a game device, it DOES posess some usability, but I think putting it in the hands of the average player is asking for trouble, as evidenced by the numerous posts in the past and all the server based mods that have gone into banning/blocking it. Just my 2 bits.</div>

<br />Civil Rights Movement
<br />
<br />1. NAACP - 
<br />The NAACP stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  This association was formed by a group of people with backgrounds of various races in response to the government&amp;#8217;s lack of support of equality among all men.  This group fought to gain equal rights among the Caucasian race.  They stuck together and fought many court battles.  The NAACP started off as a small group and gained many members over the years as they fought for they cause.  Their immediate affects weren&amp;#8217;t to dramatic, but as time told they eventually gained totally equality and to this day they still have their equality.
<br />	
<br />2. Congress of Racial Quality &amp;#8211; 
<br />The Congress of Racial Quality or C.O.R.E. was an organization created by James Farmer that fought for equality in schools, work places, and political and economical opportunities.  C.O.RE. believed in non-violent solutions and many a time staged &amp;#8220;sit-in&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221; and freedoms rides/marches.  When the organization for started they tried to eliminate racial discrimination and they helped to improve integration of all races and the desegregation of all races.  The group made a decent impact and helped the effort but the group became increasing violent so many members left.  The group is still around today and as you can see they helped.
<br />
<br />3. Black panthers &amp;#8211; 
<br />The Black Panthers group was created to help protect communities against police brutality and racism.  The group also supplied aid to poorer people such as food.  The group was inspired Malcolm X and argued to try and unite world cultures with them. The group was involved in several shootouts.  The group helped aid the freedom movement, and though it started off slow it gained support and at one point acquired over 2000 members.
<br />
<br />4. Montgomery Alabama 1961 Freedom Rides &amp;#8211; 
<br />
<br />
<br />5. University of Mississippi 1962 &amp;#8211; 
<br />
<br />
<br />6. Selma March 1965 &amp;#8211; 
<br />
<br />
<br />7. Alabama Church Bombing &amp;#8211; 
<br />
<br />
<br />8. Little Rock nine - 
<br />
<br />
<br />9. Voting Rights Act 1965 &amp;#8211; 
<br />
<br />
<br />10. Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 &amp;#8211; 
<br />The acts declared that discrimination in schools, workplaces and all public environments to be illegal and the act of 1968 helped ensure the act of 1964 by making the federal government more responsible for the integration process.  The acts still stand today and as you can see we are all considered equal.
<br />
<br />11. Stokely Carmichael &amp;#8211; 
<br />
<br />
<br />12. Malcom X &amp;#8211; 
<br />Malcolm X tried to bring the nation of Islam to the people&amp;#8217;s attention.  It was a church that preached a black twist on the Islam religion.  It stated that white men were the devil and black men could defend themselves by any means necessary.  He believes that it was wrong what they believe in, and that all are equal and there shouldn&amp;#8217;t be any tension.  Although he was assassinated his beliefs and will brought this group to the attention of the citizens and helped hinder it.
<br />
<br />13. Martin Luther King Jr. &amp;#8211; 
<br />Martin Luther King Jr. was a Historical black leader.  He spoke out with his divine words, and invoked a sense of freedom in his people.  He spoke out against racist and fought for equality.  His most famous speech &amp;#8220;I have Dream&amp;#8221; was the most profound speech made against racial oppression.  Although Jr. had an untimely death, his legacy lived on, and helped aid the anti-racial uprising eventually leading to Equality.
<br />
<br />14. Ku Klux Klan 1960&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; 
<br />The KKK suppressed any groups not like them.  They were very vulgar in their methods and showed a latent disregard for human life.  They rallied all the time, and used freedom of speech as they legal backing.  The KKK is still around today and its numbers are still growing but
<br />
