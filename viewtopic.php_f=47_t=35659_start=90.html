			<div class="content">And now, fresh off the griddle, is Chapter 16. Start warming the syrup!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />CHAPTER 16: Return
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	He could hear the voice calling him, but it seemed to come from light-years away.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Can you hear me?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent slowly opened his eyes. He could make out several shapes above him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;He's conscious.&quot;
<br />
<br />	His vision cleared and he could make out Orillion standing over him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion?&quot; he asked in a raspy voice.
<br />
<br />	&quot;How do you feel?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Never better.&quot; He tried to sit up, but it was too much of an effort.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Take it easy, Trent. You're dehydrated. It's a miracle you're alive at all.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What happened?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We found you a few hours ago on Pittsburgh. We traced your locator signal there. Get some rest, Trent. We can talk later.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent nodded, closed his eyes and retreated back to the sanctuary of unconsciousness.
<br />
<br />---------------------------------
<br />
<br />	What Trent had seen had been nothing short of amazing. He had seen the ancient Dom'Kavash empire in Sirius, when they had dominated the sector millions of years ago. He had seen their homeworld, the creation of the Dyson Sphere, and had seen...
<br />
<br />	His thoughts were interrupted as Orillion and King walked into the medical center.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ah, good to see you looking human again,&quot; Orillion said. &quot;Do you feel up to a debriefing session?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I suppose.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good. You've been cleared by the medical staff. Meet me in the briefing room in ten minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;See you then.&quot; Orillion turned and left.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I can't tell you how happy I am you're alive,&quot; King said. &quot;I needed someone to buy me a drink.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Dream on, pal.&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right, Trent,&quot; Orillion said, &quot;I'm all ears.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm not sure where to start, but the Dom'Kavash apparently want our help in defeating the Nomads here in Sirius.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How do you know this?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent hesitated for a moment. &quot;Because they told me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You mean to say, &quot; King said, &quot;that you actually talked to them?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;While I was on Pittsburgh they made some kind of telepathic contact with me. They said they had been trying to contact me for some time.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The dreams?&quot; Orillion asked. Trent nodded.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very well. Please continue.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Dom'Kavash then gave me a history lesson. They showed me their real home world. Remember the Badlands in Manhattan? That's what's left of their homeworld.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What?&quot; King exclaimed.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Apparently there was some kind of civil war between the Dom'Kavash and the Nomads. Dr. Quintaine's analysis of the Nomad's origin is right, by the way. The Nomads were created by the Dom'Kavash to be an all-purpose labor organism. The only problem was the Nomads figured that out and wanted their independence.
<br />
<br />	&quot;It was a war like I'd never seen. The Nomads proved to be a deadly enemy, probably from the abilities the Dom'Kavash created them with. They beat the Dom'Kavash into a pulp, destroyed their home world, and the survivors retreated through the Hyper Gate into the Dyson Sphere they had been building. The Nomads tried to follow, but could not go through the gate for reasons the Dom'Kavash did not show me.
<br />
<br />	&quot;In the Dyson Sphere the Dom'Kavash tried to rebuild their civilization. They recalled every member of their society scattered throughout their empire to the Dyson Sphere, and they managed to spend several millenia there in relative peace while the Nomads continued to ravage what remained of the Dom'Kavash empire outside the sphere.
<br />
<br />	&quot;During their exile in the sphere the Dom'Kavash created a biological agent that was poison to the Nomads. They began turning the substance into weapons.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Cardamine?&quot; King asked.
<br />
<br />	Trent nodded. &quot;They found a planet outside the sphere that the Nomads had not found, a planet with an ideal climate for growing cardamine. Before they could harvest the cardamine, the Nomads launched a final assault that drove the Dom'Kavash out of the Dyson Sphere and into parts unknown. The cardamine, however killed many of the Nomads. Fearing that their race was also doomed, they retreated to the safety of their conquered worlds and went into a self-imposed hibernation.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Until the Rheinland expedition woke them up, &quot; Orillion said. &quot;That, Trent, is one hell of a story. The next question is, what do we do now?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Dom'Kavash have pretty much made me the liaison between our species, so I'm sure they will contact me again in the future.&quot; Trent hesitated. &quot;I don't think we can trust them.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Why?&quot; Orillion asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I get the distinct impression they're hiding something. I asked them straight up what would happen to the human race here in Sirius, and they said simply 'All will be as it was before.' They're hiding something, Orillion, I know it.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So the question is what do we do now?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;There's something else you should know,&quot; Trent said. &quot;I found Juni. She's joined some group called the Sirius Covenant, along with Kress. They've sworn to destroy the Dom'Kavash. They're the ones who stole the Horus.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion was silent for a moment, but Trent could see the anger in his eyes.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Damn,&quot; he said finally. &quot;I think we're going to see a lot more blood shed before this is all over.&quot;
<br />	
<br />
<br />
<br />Mmmm...Synth Paste...

<br />One of King's lines stood out a bit though:
<br />
<br />&quot;You mean to say,&quot; King said, &quot;that you have actually spoken with them?&quot;
<br />
<br />I dunno... it seems uncharacteristically <i>proper </i> given the speaker. King always struck me as a &quot;You mean you actually talked to them?&quot; kind of guy.</div>

<br />Wow, this is incredable. Not that this makes much of a difference but about what Codename said, that line you had King say, he just doesn't seem like the kind of person who would say something like that. He always struck me as a more hard-drinking &quot;tough&quot;-guy. I love this story though, maybe you can stay for more that a month this time? (Yeah right, like I have a right to talk.) Keep it going, it's good to know we can rely on someone here to come out with a new chapter every couple of days. (Bret don't rub this in my face.)

			<div class="content">And now, served with a side of our secret sauce, here's Chapter 17.
<br />
<br />---------
<br />
<br />Chapter 17: A Surprise
<br />
<br />	Trent sat alone at the bar sipping at a Sidewinder Fang, lost in his thoughts. He felt a great sense of relief now that he had told Orillion what he knew about the Dom'Kavash, but also felt a great deal of apprehension knowing that he was also in the grip of that ancient race.
<br />
<br />	King had wanted to talk further after the briefing, but sensed that Trent needed some down time alone to collect himself, and in a rare display of tact did not press the matter.
<br />
<br />	James Montgomery, the wise bartender of the Osiris, came over.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Can I get you another one, Trent?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, thanks,&quot; Trent smiled. &quot;I gotta take it easy on the sauce for a while.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Did Orillion put you back on the flight roster?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yep.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good. We need you out there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The shipwide intercom came to life.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Colonel Trent, please report to the briefing room.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;There's my cue,&quot; Trent said. &quot;Thanks for the drink.&quot; He stood up and made his way to the briefing room.
<br />
<br />	The room was filled with all the senior staff, and the look on Orillion's face led him to believe that something big had just happened.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Let's settle down, people,&quot; Orillion said. &quot;It seems that our friends the Dom'Kavash have left Manhattan for parts unknown.&quot; There was scattered murmuring through the room. &quot;As of now, we still have no clues as to where they went or even why they left.
<br />
<br />	&quot;President Jacobi has requested that the Osiris remain in New York until further notice in case our help is needed. She will be addressing Liberty in general in a few hours. In the meantime, I want everyone to stay focused. Liberty is bound to be a bit uneasy for a while considering what's happened.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We will be taking up station near Zone 21 to monitor events here in New York. I want everyone rested up, but stay alert. Anything could happen. That's all, people.&quot; With that, the briefing concluded and everyone made for the door.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, could you stay for a moment?&quot; Orillion  said. Trent turned around.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You may find this interesting.&quot; Orillion handed over a data pad and Trent looked it over. When he was finished he let out a long breath.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Is this for real?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know, but maybe a Covenant defector is the break we've been looking for. You feel up to it?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm game, but I think we need to do this carefully. My experience with them was not exactly a civil one.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Agreed.&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------
<br />
<br />	Trent found King in the bar banging his head into shape with liberal amounts of alcohol. He walked over to the booth and sat down.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Are you still capable of speech?&quot; Trent asked with a sly grin.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ahh, you know me. I can handle anything.&quot; King replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;See if you can handle this.&quot; Trent handed over the data pad Orillion had given him. King read it over, then looked up at Trent.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Are they kidding?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion wants to check it out, so I'm flying out to Kepler to meet the so-called defector. Wanna go?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sounds crazy and suicidal to me. Maybe it's just the alcohol talking, but what the hell, I need the diversion.&quot;
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />	Several hours later an Anubis and an Eagle emerged from the jump gate and docked with the trade lane that would take them to Ames Research station. Trent and King would then fly toward a waypoint deep in a dust cloud for the rendezvous.
<br />
<br />	Trent had to admit that he was happy to be back in his old ship, inferior though it was to the Thoth he had flown days before. He was grateful that Orilion had had the foresight to have it flown in from Toledo. &quot;After all,&quot; Orillion had said, &quot;it's your ship, and you know how to fly it best.&quot; Besides, he really liked the killer guns he had taken from the Red Hessians. Maybe one day he would figure out where they came from.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So why isn't this guy meeting us on Ames?&quot; King wondered.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Dunno. Maybe he thought the middle of a dust cloud was safer?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah, I'm sure he's thinking that.&quot; 
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right, we're coming up on Ames,&quot; Trent said as they left the trade lane. He punched in the coordinates the defector had supplied into the navigation system. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;I just punched in the rendezvous point, and it looks like it pretty deserted out there. Might be some Xeno activity so stay frosty.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ehh, the Xenos are a bunch of pansies,&quot; King muttered. &quot;We can take 'em.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent couldn't help but smile at that. His thoughts were interrupted as a warning tone came from his scanner.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, lookie here,&quot; Trent said. &quot;I've got a contact, range three thousand klicks. Looks like it's solo. Can't make it out yet.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I gotta tell you, I'm a little surprised myself,&quot; King replied. &quot;This could actually be real. I'm charging up the guns, just to be safe.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Unknown contact, this is Order Gamma three-dash-one,&quot; Trent said into his comm system, &quot;please identify, over.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Order Gamma Three-dash-One, this is Covenant Alpha One-dash-Five,&quot; came the reply in an obviously computer-generated voice. Must be using a voice masker, Trent thought to himself. Interesting.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Am I to assume that you are my escort?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Affirmative, One-dash-Five. Form up on our wing.&quot; Trent could now see the outline of an Anubis fighter closing on them. He held his breath as the ship came closer and closer, then entered formation.
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right, people, let's get on out of here,&quot; King said.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I recommend we avoid the trade lanes completely,&quot; the Covenant defector said. &quot;It's better that we remain unseen.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;He's got a point, King,&quot; Trent said. &quot;I'm setting our next waypoint for the Colorado jump gate. ETA one hour twenty-six minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The three spacecraft engaged their cruise engines and headed for the jump gate. Trent kept his eyes on his instruments, expecting trouble to show up ant any moment. He wasn't disappointed.
<br />
<br />	Five spacecraft appeared on his scanner and closed the distance between them. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Umm, Trent, were you expecting additional escort?&quot; King asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, were you?&quot;
<br />
<br />	The ships came within visual range, and Trent could make out the unique shape of Anubis heavy fighters, who promptly opened fire on them.
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's a trap!&quot; King exclaimed as he broke formation and began to engage the attackers. Trent was ready to turn and engage the so-called defector, but stopped as he saw the ship begin to engage the attackers. Trent punched his thrusters and dived into the fray.
<br />
<br />	The Covenant defector was a talented pilot, Trent observed as the pilot engaged the attacking ships, taking out two of the attackers himself. King had his hands full, engaging one of the fighters while a second one engaged him. King managed to destroy his target, but could not shake off his attacker. Trent flew in behind King's attacker and fired off several rounds. The energy blasts knocked out the enemy's shields, and the Anubis broke away. Trent launched a missile, which tracked in on the fighter and destroyed it. Trent and King then engaged the remaining fighter, dispatching it easily.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I show all clear. How you doing, King?&quot; Trent asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm fine. What the hell happened.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Covenant One-dash-Five, you got an explanation for this?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Apparently the Covenant doesn't like the idea of me leaving, and with what I know I can't say I blame them.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Meaning what?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I will not discuss this until I meet with Commander Orillion.&quot; One-dash-Five then lapsed into silence.
<br />
<br />	The three sped on towards the jump gate.
<br />
<br />-----------------------
<br />
<br />	The flght desk of the Osiris had beemn cleared, and several armed guards were stationed about as the ships landed. Orillion and two guards walked over to the Covenant vessel, weapons drawn, to meet the defector who was awaiting them. King and Trent joined the group.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So,&quot; Orillion said to the defector, &quot;Who might you be?&quot;
<br />
<br />	The defector began to remove the flight suit helmet, and Trent's jaw dropped as the face of Jun'ko Zane emerged from under the helmet. Juni looked at Orillion, King, and finally at Trent, and for the first time in nearly a year, flashed him a smile.
