			<div class="content">The major problem with freelancer right now is that it needs an expansion pack. 
<br />Right now there are only a few things you can do:
<br />
<br />1) Get hired by a base to go and kill a few guys from another faction they dont like.
<br />2) Transport commodities where they are needed
<br />
<br />Even if you decide to start raiding convoys or smuggle cardamine, you're really only doing minor variations of those two things. The combat missions are also pretty much very simmilar. Lets not kid ourselves here: You go to waypoint X, kill guys (sometimes one, sometimes all, sometimes destroy cargo they drop, sometimes get them/cargo they drop) and then your done. You dont have any impact on the system. You don't get to see any real change from your efforts, since all the base destruction missions, the bases are spawned for you. Changing scenery, factions, and equipment can only do so much to change that.
<br />
<br />I'm sure theres some sort of inter clan warfare in multiplayer that really effects all this, and thats nice, but I'm looking for some fundamental changes in the inherit game.
<br />
<br />After beating the game, I set off to explore most of what I could. I tried out trading, and did long niobium/diamond runs for fun and profit. Well, it was kind of boring in transit, but it was exciting since I wasnt neutral to every faction along the way. Finally I got tired of that and set out to get the best ship I could get. So, I figure, get all buddy buddy with some outcasts and get a Sabre, kill some nomads and take their weapons. After that I really couldn't think of anything else to do. I had no reason to go find better equipment, since I had it all. I had no reason to go find a better ship because I had one of the best. While exploring would've been nice, the game didnt lend itself to pointing you in the right direction. It got boring. Real boring.
<br />
<br />I've heard some people argue that you can have fun flying for every faction, but lets face it, besides the fact that they hand out money to you for killing ships from other factions and let you dock in their bases, you dont get any real connection to them. The factions dont grow, they dont reward you for your loyalty. Furthermore, when you fly a mission with a faction, they only give you that one mission, there is never any real continuation, where if you go back to the base they immediately offer you another mission to go on like Juni does.
<br />
<br />So what can be done? Modding efforts have gotten the game only so far. Sure, you can add new stars, factions, ships, items, but in the end your not fundamentally impacting the same gameplay system. You still operate with the same apathetic factions, and enventually you will find the be-all-end-all ship layout system that you dont see any reason to improve upon. And some mods, in my opinion, completely miss the point of the game freelancer and throw as many ship models and systems in regardless of continuity. I'm not wanting to mod my game so I can watch as my freelancer-esque ship fends off ships from an entirely different universe.
<br />
<br />While there are new server tools coming out that will let there be GMs and make some impact on the game, it largely falls on people managing data and being prompt about updates, it still doesnt do anything to singe player.
<br />
<br />But I'm suggesting something completely more epic and grand in scope.
<br />
<br />Freelancer is a good start, but it needs more interactivity. An expansion that could expand the gameplay so that factions would change based on player actions, that features a more robust mission system. From the little I've read, these were probably in the original design specs that never got through to the end, and is a sad tale indeed. An expansion to the original game could extend its playability by giving it some new life.
<br />
<br />A sequel could work too, but for the most part that would have to continue with the plot of the original game, and crafting a well designed plot and adding enough new features to make the game look different would be more time consuming than just reintroducing what was originally planned but later cut out.
<br />
<br />Bottom Line? MS wont let a sleeper hit have the potential of becoming a real hit.

			<div class="content">Hmmm, I'm curious what Eraser had to edit above.  Oh well if I try to find out, B-)
<br />
<br />Yes, there is an unfinished feel to the game but many games (not all) have that feel whether by design (sequal coming!) or by fault (budget ran out).  As for the storyline it is all a matter of opinion.  It IS called Freelancer!  There is also game interest where after playing any game for an amount of time the fun wears off.  This time varies from player to player but eventually it happens.  Good thing too or else game programmers wouldn't be able to sell anything in the future!  One thing I have found that has not worn off is the multi-player aspect.  As long as players still go to servers (like mine) I feel FL is still fun to play.  No storyline, script, AI or graphics are as fun or interesting as interacting with other players!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Hey TLR, the B-) black eye above doesn't work!

			<div class="content">I have an idea.  Why don't all the really GOOD Modders, like chips, baked potato, etc., get together and just make an expansion.  If that could happen, then they, and anyone else, could keep making expansions.  I mean mods already cover ships, rumors, weapons, add-ons, news, making new systems, new bases, character faces and clothes, rules, etc. (I could go on and on) If someone could put all this together and MAYBE con Digital Anvil and/or MS to do JUST the cut sceens as a small side project or something, then package it all up and put it on TLR for download for like $20 (example, +/- a few dollars) and split the profits.
<br />
<br />I'd buy it!  After I get better at modding and stuff (still pretty new) I'd try to help with it.
<br />
<br />Just a thought.  I mean, we (meaning those special people listed above) can already mod quite well, why wait for MS or DA, maybe if someone got the ball rolling, MS and/or DA would jump on board.

			<div class="content">&quot;Well I did some poking around and found out from a reliable source they are working on FL sequal. Whether it will ever hit the shelves, get cancelled tomorrow or never get acknowledged until the last minute, I am satisfied with knowing that at one point some work beyond the current FL game was happening. What I hope is that the DVD-ROM format is more prevelant so instead of a 650 MB game, FL2 may be a 4.7 GB or even a 9.4 GB game! No more truncated clues throughout the game to what might have been!&quot;
