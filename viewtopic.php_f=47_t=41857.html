			<div class="content">Here is the first, unedited draft of the story, for those who want to read it:
<br />
<br />Some time after the Nomads' defeat, Trent's life changed. Juni had asked to marry him, and Trent agreed. At the wedding, Orillion, Lord Hakkera, Cobo,
<br />King, Herr Von Claussen, Quintaine, Sinclair, and Kress were there.  Their honeymoon was on the cruise liner Hawaii in Sigma-19.  Unfortunately for them,
<br />their honeymoon was cut short. The ship's command radioed in to inform the
<br />guests that  a large group of GMG ships are on an intercept course to the cruise liner. The ship was now being beaten with the Guild's elite. Juni and Trent, along with a lot of guests were attacking the GMG ships. In five minutes they were reduced to smolders. A guest, Ronell Dracon, said that the Guild probably attacked the Hawaii because of the Outcasts' cancellation of Artifact trading with the Guild. The Hogosha, who is now trading lots of artifacts with the Outcasts aboard the Hawaii. Even though there were very few casualties and only minor damage was reported on the Hawaii, everyone was puzzled why they would criminalize themselves to get at the Hogosha, or as so it seemed.
<br />
<br />           Back on Manhattan, Juni read some interesting news- GMG ships have destroyed the Hawaii- with 3,400 estimated casualties. Based on a data cache salvaged, the docking ports were somehow jammed, meaning that no one can get out. Trent was glad that neither him nor Juni were on the Hawaii then, as he would rather die than lose Juni. Juni was also relieved.
<br />
<br />           Now the House Police are looking for the GMG. As soon as word was out about the Hawaii's destruction the House Police went to Sigma-13, only to find abandoned GMG stations. They are hiding somewhere. There has been a bounty for every GMG worker. People can see Bounty Hunters in almost every system.
<br />
<br />         Juni was still in the LSF, although a recent promotion backed by President 
<br />Jacobi made her an Assistant LSF director. Because of this, she had less time to spend with Trent. One day, she came back home and told Trent that her ship was almost destroyed by a GMG patrol. She had been working on assignment in Sigma-21, a newly discovered system. There were lots of GMG workers there. Trent told Juni to be careful with what jobs she takes on.  Juni told Trent that she is resigning from the LSF, but not because of what happened in Sigma-21, but that she wanted to spend more time with him. She had heard from King that
<br />he proposed to Sinclair, but she can't make up her mind. Trent said that she might not like King's attraction to cheap drinks, which for some reason made Juni laugh.
<br />
<br />          Trent and Juni own a house on Manhattan, in a more quiet place. Neither of them have to work due to a massive bounty Trent recieved concerning a Lane Hacker. Even though the Hackers helped them in Magellan, that doesn't stop them from attacking Juni or Trent. Everything seems to be in order for them.
<br />
<br />          Then comes the earthquake- Tobias has been placed in prison. When Trent tried to bail him out, the guards opened fire on him- something that he would not have survived had he not had a gun on him. Fortunately, Tobias was placed before a court, and he was pardoned. Trent asked him why he was in jail, and Tobia said something about a bar fight. Trent told Tobias to be careful next time, as he might not always be around to get him out of trouble. Juni is bewildered by this chain of events, and Trent doesn't know what his future has in store for him. 
<br />
<br />          Trent then comes home one night to find Juni unconsious with a long gash on her arm. He takes her to Medical and tries to figure out what happened. By now she is unconscious for 3 days. Trent is really worried. When she wakes up, she starts throwing up blood. She tells Trent that a strange figure with glowing eyes broke into their house, said &quot;Have a taste of what is in store for you&quot;, cast some sort of force bounding her, then he bludgeoned her, and then one slash from something sharp on his arm. Trent tells her that they need to get as far away from Manhattan as possible.
<br />
<br />           They moved to Freeport 9 in the Omicron Theta, but not before being ambushed by lots of pirates and a GMG patrol. Now what was that doing there?
<br />Trent also noticed that Juni has been acting strangely. He asks her what is wrong, and she tells him some interesting news- she is going to have a baby.
<br />Trent has wanted to be a father. He finally gets to share his love with somebody else. 
<br />  
<br />          Tobias seems to have dug up some old documents. After a month lawyers
<br />confirmed that these leave a fortune to Edison Trent, from his great-grandmother. The fortune was 13.5 million credits. Juni was amazed and she asked Trent how his great-grandmother managed to get so much money. Trent had no idea. He bought Juni a top-of-the-line Titan from an old friend of his in the Corsairs. She said that it beats the pants off of her old Defender. He also paid a Zoner on Freeport 9 to hack his reputation with the Corsairs, allowing them to live on Planet Crete, so that Juni would not be attacked as she was on Manhattan.
<br />
<br />          All of that peace and tranquility was broken when Orillion contacted them
<br />to meet him on the Battleship Osiris. When they got there he told them that the Nomads are believed to be building a wanton annihilator weapon.</div>
