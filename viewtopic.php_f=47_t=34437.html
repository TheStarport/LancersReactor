			<div class="content">my latest dan fic is not some much a sequel to pilot 2 even though the main character in the story is from pilot 2 the first chapter might have a metion of what happened in pilot 2 basicly its a new story and not in the same type of setting otherwise i would of called it Pilot 3 
<br />
<br />There are 3 main charaters 
<br /> Captian-Lixin Watts
<br /> Medical- Elex Vernin
<br />Engineer- Derik Hiezen
<br />
<br />Its about a crew of three exploring the unexploer Siruis sector 
<br />also i intend to make it go on longer then others becuase it does not stick to one mian objective all the time
<br />
<br />with out further delaying here is chapter one
<br />
<br />Chapter 1
<br />
<br />Lixin Watts stood looking up at the stars. it was five years beetween the war with Rhienland and liberty. Rhienland had given back what it took and liberty formaly apoligized. afters 6 years of constant Choas finaly things had settled down. he had gotten married 3 years ago and was looking forward to a peacful life on New Berlin. but one evening that all changed.
<br />Lixin was watching t.v when his computer said there was a incoming message
<br />
<br />&quot;Earl?&quot; Lixin said when he opened the message &quot;Long time no see&quot;
<br />&quot;yeah&quot; Earl replied &quot;Listen kid i got a job for you&quot;
<br />&quot;oh really, well i am kinda settled'  Lixin said
<br />&quot;no kid this is once in a lifetime opertunty&quot; Earl said with a big smile
<br />&quot;thats what they said when i was drafted&quot; Lixen replied promptly
<br />&quot;no, HQ wants you to command a three man ship Exspolring space. in siruis of course. but this thing is a amazing it has a new cruise drive that goes 10,000 k per 30 seconds. of course you would have to write about what you see scan things take pictures. so what do you say kid.&quot; Earl said talking fast and looking excited
<br />&quot;i guess so&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;okay meet you tomorrow i launches in a week. i'll pick you up at lunch time and you'll meet the other two guys you'll be working with. Earl out&quot; 
<br />
<br />Lixin went to bed and had trouble sleeping that night. the next day he got ready and walked outside to meet Earl in his ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;were just flying up to the ring, kid&quot; Earl said
<br />&quot;okay how much does this pay?&quot; asked Lixin
<br />&quot;depends on what you find&quot; Earl Replied
<br />
<br />Earls shutle took off and soon the were out of the docking ring. they docked on the ring. Earl and lixin got out and walked over to the bar.
<br />
<br />&quot;and heres the two guys your going to be working with. meet Elex and Derik.&quot; Earl said 
<br />&quot;so what do you guys do. im in comand as you know.&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;im medical&quot; Elex Repiled
<br />&quot;and im a Engineer&quot; Derik said
<br />
<br />They had lunch and discussed what to look for on the voyage. soon the launch day came and all of Rhienland was watching as the ship Star finder would launch. As the three crewmen walked to the ship dozens of people were taking pictures and filming it. Lixin and the others got in there seats and launched into space. there a Rhienland Escort met them and escorted them to the border. 
<br />at the border they were about to activate cruise when 6 outcast ships came out of a near by nebula.
<br />
<br />&quot;the border worlds is outcast space, surrender your ship&quot; said the lead outcast
<br />&quot;Elex get ready for wounded Derik standbye for repairs and activating cruise&quot; then he turned to the screen were the outcast had said is message &quot;if you knew me you would know i never surrender&quot;
<br />&quot;very well Rhienlander&quot; Replied the outcast &quot;outcasts engage&quot;
<br />
<br />Three outcast ship rushed the Star finder. the Star finder being larger then a fighter  used its anti fighter turrets. they managed to destroy one fighter. the ther three outcasts had luanched several missiles then engaged the Escort. The anti missile turrets managed to take out a few missiles but the hull was still rocked. 
<br />there were four outcasts left and the escort was destroyed. 
<br />
<br />&quot;we have to go to cruise! now! derik!&quot; Lixin yelled
<br />
<br />Then the Star Finder shot off into space to explor the unknown

			<div class="content">Chapter 2 Star Finder
<br />
<br />Lxin woke up and wlaked over to his coffee machine. he got himself a nice big cup and took a sip. a message came up over the inship com. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Lixin here, what is it Derik?&quot;
<br />&quot;sir i can't be sure but i believe that thre is some sort of a wormhole possibly leading much farther then any jump hole known.&quot; Derik said &quot;it would be very interesting to go through and come back with the readings.&quot;
<br />&quot;meet me on the bridge on the Bridge derik&quot; Lixin replied
<br />
<br />Lixin wlaked down the halls towards the bridge. it was times when he had responability that made him long for New Berlin.
<br />
<br />&quot;look Derik that 'wormhole' might be unstable for all we know it could lead us into... i don't know, but i have a bad eeling about this.&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;this is once in a lifetime chance to make history who knows what we might find even.. aliens for the first time humanity could contact another race.&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;okay, go through by at any sign of trouble were out so fast.&quot; Lixin replied
<br />
<br />The Starfinder slowy entered the wormhole. and if anyone was wtching they would of seen a flash of light and then a ship disapearing.
<br />The starfinder came out in some type of asteriod field.
<br />
<br />&quot;well look at that. you can see that anywere in Rhienland, Derik.&quot; Elex said
<br />&quot;no i dont think so ...&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;what do you mean&quot;  Derik asked
<br />&quot;this looks like traces of space stations ot depos something like that.&quot; Lixin Replied
<br />&quot;humans this far out.... no that leaves aliens.&quot; Elex said
<br />&quot;not for sure&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;what do you mean?&quot; asked Elex
<br />&quot;i think what Derik is saying is this might be made by our ancestors. from Earth&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;it is possible unlikly but possible we could be in Earths system right now considering our nav maps dont list anything this far out and are usless.&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;and i say we turn this ship around now go back into were ever we came from.&quot; Elex said
<br />&quot;no, we are going to find out what has happened here.&quot;
<br />
<br />The starfinder slowly drifted through space scanning the area. but in the darkness of the field something was waiting.</div>

			<div class="content">Chapter 3 StarSearch
<br />
<br />The starfinder slowly scanned the field of twisted mettle. the crew llooked scarred as chared bits of bones floated around them. they coundn't tell if the bones were human or alien. then the shipped was rocked and Lixin was thrown across the bridge.
<br />
<br />&quot;what the hell was that&quot; Asked lixin
<br />&quot;incoming hail. putting it up.&quot; Anouced Derik
<br />
<br />&quot;You, what is your clan and were did you find that ship.&quot; said a human oddly with a goodnumber of implanets
<br />&quot;we are of no clan. we are a Exploration vessel from Rhienland space a place beyond the wormhole.&quot; Said Lixin
<br />&quot;i am sorry to hear that Captain&quot; The man Replied
<br />&quot;oh and why is that&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;Becuase that wormhole seems to have problem sending things back. of course we have been working on a device to get us through but i am not so sure of your Truth about this Rhienland thing. you see you could be a enemy spy so i am afriad we will not let you have the device.&quot; The man replied and then shut down the hail
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, weve got problems they think were a enemy clan and have refused to help us and other clans might be the same.&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;i suggest a meeting with there captain&quot; Elex said
<br />&quot;hail them Derik linix said
<br />
<br />&quot;may we help you Captain&quot; the man said once he was back on the screen
<br />&quot;yes do you mind if we follow you to your base and meet with you?&quot; Linix said
<br />&quot;our ship is our base handed down from generation to generation it has always been this way' the man said
<br />&quot;then do you mind if we come aboard or vis versa&quot; Asked lixin
<br />&quot;we will come aboard&quot; the man replied
<br />
<br />The clan ship slowly lowered its self on to the top of the Starfinder then the above hatch opened and the man jumped down.
<br />
<br />&quot;well Rhienlander if you are what do you wish to discuss&quot; Asked the man
<br />&quot;tell me about your people?&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;alright&quot; the man said &quot;it was many years ago Earth sent men to explore space. this ship was one of those ships. the old crew left and found what used to be this system. it was wonderful 8 of the most rich planets the ship returned to find Earth burnt and destroyed few people survived  we dont know what happened or how it happened. but we do know that we had to return to the wonderful system. for 200 years we grew butt then the goverment of each planet grew evil and paranoid one bye one they fell into a war the lasted one hundered years of the most aful and brutal fighting when it was over only a few clans remained in the dust of planets and ships.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;i am sorry to hear that but you must let us back through that wormhole. otherwise like you we will be stranded from home.&quot;
<br />&quot;i will give you the device if you kill the clan that borders us&quot;
<br />

			<div class="content">Chapter 4 Star Search
<br />
<br />&quot;i dont kill people for money ive been in one war already and i dont intead to beome a pawn in another one&quot; Lixin Said , his voice cold with deterination.
<br />&quot;oh well if you dont want to get home... besides you'll get cuaght up sooner or later if you dont get out. i will give you 2 days to bring me proof that you killed them. this pad will provide all the info you need. think carefully for your time is sooon to run out. goodbye.&quot; the man said with a hint of amusement in his voice.
<br />
<br />Lixin sat in the captians chair looking depressed.
<br />
<br />&quot;you know when i first was offred a job they promised to fighting or killing just exploration but now we have to kill someone to get on with our mission.&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;well i have the mark were the enemy ship will be shall we go?&quot; Derik asked
<br />&quot;Go ahead&quot; Linix said
<br />
<br />The Starfinder cruised through the ruins of planets and stations as bones everfilled space. the crew of the Starfinder look asthey saw horrows of war unimagened by and Colonie man. finaly they just arrived outside the other clanship sensor range.
<br />
<br />&quot;sir. this should be a easy fight these ships a years old and have not been ever fully repaired. shall we fire a volley of torpedos&quot; Derik asked
<br />&quot;Fire at will&quot; Lixin Replied
<br />
<br />the torpedos hits the ship and did heavy damage to it. it powered up its weapons and charged at Lixin. it fired several volleys of missiles but due to its outdated weapons the anti missile turrets knocked off any threat the missiles posed. then lixin fired and destroyed the enemy ship. they returned to the other clansman who invited the crew onboard.
<br />
<br />The crew of the Starfinder walked into a room were there was a long table filled with foods. there were four seats one fill up by the clansleader. there was one guard on each side of the room.
<br />
<br />&quot;come sit down my friends.&quot; the clansmen said
<br />&quot;look i dont mean to be rude but we will just take the device and be on ourway.&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;oh im sorry&quot; the clansmen said &quot;but theres a change of plans. your dont get the device. guards.&quot;
<br />
<br />The guards began to fire upon the three. Lixin rolled under the table and derik ducked and ran behind a corner. but Elex to stunned to move go hit several times in the shoulder. 
<br />Lixin, outraged jumped on the table two pistols in hand and shot bith of the guards. Derik ran over to Elex. Lixin threw one of the guns aside and picked up the clansleader by the collar.
<br />
<br />&quot;i kill for you. and this is what i get. i dont like men who hire other men to kill for him. and i don't like men who then try to kill those they hired.&quot; Lixin said with a low Growl
<br />&quot;he's dead, Lixin&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;now Give me my device&quot; Lixin yelled then thre the clansleader across the room. the clans leader pulled out a small device from his pocket and tossed it to Lixin. Lixin picked it up and put it in his pocket then he picked up the clansleader by the neck and proceeded to snap his neck.

<br />
<br />With The clansmen dead lixin finaly felt at peace with elex. He and Derik had gone through the wormhole. Anfter a hour of travel they came upon a system were two planets orbited a sun and between the two planets there was always a perfectly straight line.
<br />
<br />&#8220;wow have you ever seen anything like it?&#8221; Derik said
<br />&#8220;amazing how with all the possbilitties in the unaverse it turned out like this&#8221;
<br />&#8220;it wasn&#8217;t chance Mr. Lixin and Mr.Derik&#8221; said a voice from the shadows
<br />&quot;i dont know who you are but you dont just come on my ship.&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;frogive me Mr.Lixin. but my people were most interested in you and your crew.&quot; The Alien said
<br />&quot;well its not much of a crew any more&quot; Lixin said &quot;who are you? and why are you on my ship&quot;
<br />&quot;ah you worry to much i bear no harm to you or your crew&quot; The Alien said &quot;i am Mogh of the Trifortians&quot;
<br />&quot;well i guess its nice to meet you&quot;  Lixin said
<br />&quot;uh captain&quot; Derik said &quot;incoming hail puting it up&quot;
<br />&quot;this is Grogh of the Elite Triansha of the Trifortians the man aboard your ship , Mogh is a tratior to the empire and must be handed over at once. do not let his lies fool you he is most skilled in killing.&quot; 
<br />&quot;i dont know who your people are but i cant hand a man over to you just yet&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;it is not your position to do such a thing&quot; Grogh said
<br />&quot;yes it is this is my ship and on here i call the shots&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;this man has murdered many people and took one of your people hostage&quot; Grogh said
<br />'i will give him to you for exchange o this person of mine you speak of&quot; lixin said
<br />&quot;very well. wise choice&quot; Grogh said
<br />
<br />&quot;Mogh why did you kill his people and take a human hostage&quot; Derik asked
<br />&quot;becuase he is a cruel tyrant and i wish to free our people of him&quot; Mogh responded
<br />&quot;and the human&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;i thought that our Scienctists would be intersted&quot; mogh said
<br />&quot;i hope you go to hell&quot; lixin said
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain we are sending the human to you in a shuttle be prepared to meet her.&quot; Grogh said over the intercom
<br />
<br />the top hatch of the ship opened down and and the former hostage jumped down. she had a tatoo that indacated she was a Outcast. she looked at Mogh and pointed a gun to his forehead.
<br />
<br />&quot;you ****ing son of a *****  am going to kill you&quot;
<br />&quot;hold it&quot; Lixin said &quot;his goverment wants him alive&quot;
<br />&quot;fine Rhienlander&quot;
<br />
<br />Derik turned to Lixin
<br />
<br />&quot;we cant house a outcast its a bad idea.&quot;
<br />&quot;i dont like it either but we cant just leave her here outcast or not&quot; Lixen said the he turned to the outcast &quot; you can stay but i run the ship&quot;
<br />&quot;fine Rhienlander&quot; She said
<br />&quot;okay if you are going to be part f our crew we need to know what you Excell at&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;killing things&quot; She replied &quot;and you guys shuld go back to rhienand the borderworlds are ours&quot;
<br />&quot;no these are not the borderworlds this land belongs to the Trifortians&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;fine go ahead but there will be more outcasts and we will stop you&quot; she said then walked off

<br />
<br />Lixin sat in his quarters thinking. he regretted taking the job. as amazing as it was he had kid who called himself a enegineer and outcast with a lust for blood on board. the only sane person other then himself was Elex and he was dead far away.
<br />He lit a Ciggerete and took a long puff. times were hard but he had a mission to explore new space. he wanted to tell Earl about Mogh and Grogh but Grogh had asked that he not tell others about there existence.
<br />but what puzzeled him the most is his outcast 'friend' had said that there were other outcasts out there. how he though the engine he used was still classified as a prototype. 
<br />Lixin decieded to walk up to the bridge.
<br />
<br />&quot;ah Lixin what brings you here.&quot; Derik asked
<br />&quot;definetly not you&quot; Lixin replied &quot;i think, due to the way the outcast has been acting there might be a attack soon&quot;
<br />&quot;well you sure can make a outcast feel cast out! hahhaha&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;shut up Derik&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;sir&quot; derik said
<br />&quot;what did i say Derik&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;INCOMING OUTCASTS&quot; Derik said
<br />&quot;no derik i said- holy crap battle stations&quot; Lixin replied as he scrambeled to the controls
<br />
<br />Five outcasts burst dead at them lasers blaring. Lixin Tried to fight back but the outcasts had the suprise and he was overwhelemed
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir&quot; Derik shouted &quot;outcasts have boarded us&quot;
<br />&quot;****..&quot; Lixin said
<br />
<br />Then the bridge door opened and six outcasts poured in.
<br />
<br />&quot;everyone up agianst the wall&quot; the leader said &quot; we warned you twice but you didn't listen. i am in command of this ship now Rhienlander.&quot;

			<div class="content">Chapter 8
<br />
<br />Rhienland. Just a old memory to lixin. he had now been in space for 4 months. a few strange encounters but mostly charting stars and nebulas. he had learned that fate of earth that a war had swepped across it and that the murder each other leavin few left alive. old hates from thousands of years ago still burned in the hearts of the clansmen. this worried Lixin if the clansmen and there new device made it across and found the colonies they might spread hatred and crime. that would destroy the years of fighting Lixin had done. 
<br />It was late at night and everyone else was asleep. at least Mark was now with him he thought. He then walked down the halls to his room. he had a hard time falling aspleep as one line ran through his head
<br />
<br />&quot;when we returned Earth was gone. few lived to tell the tale.&quot;
<br />
<br />He wondered if when he returned the colonies would be in flames. he wondered if he might bring down the wrath of someone who would finish humanity.
<br />That morning he got up, tired from lack of sleep. he walked down Starfinders sleek halls. he entered the bridge were Mark was drinking.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, Lixin how are ya. say the goverment sure wanted you to relax this ale is great.&quot; Mark said with a smile
<br />&quot;Hey mark see that planet on the view screen?&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;yeah why?&quot; Mark asked
<br />&quot;i think that planet can support life&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;its still a while away if there are ships and stations we cant read them and most likely the can't read us.&quot; Mark replied 
<br />&quot;set a course. move in on that planet. part of our mission is to repersent Rhienland so if we meet any aliens be on your best behavior.&quot; Lixin said
<br />
<br />The ship cam closer too the planet when several wings of fighters came surounded there ship
<br />
<br />&quot;getting hail putting it up&quot; Derik said
<br />
<br />&quot;what is your ship i.... your not one of us..&quot; the Alien said &quot;fighterss prepare to engage Alien Vessel&quot;
<br />&quot;that will not be.. needed. we mean no harm. we come from a human nation called Rhienland we are exploring unkown space to us.&quot; Lixin said 
<br />&quot; stay were you are will wil return...&quot; The alien said
<br />
<br />&quot;would you mind telling me what is going on?&quot; Mark asked &quot;how do we know they wont come back and kill us all.&quot;
<br />&quot;would we do that&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;no&quot; Mark Replied
<br />&quot;then why would they?&quot; Lixin said
<br />
<br />A battleship came back escorted by more fighters. a Alien popped up on the screen
<br />
<br />&quot;perhaps you will make worthy prey&quot; 
<br />
<br />End chapter 8

<br />
<br />&quot;prey what the hell are you talking about&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;we pride ourselfs on who we can destroy. every race we have ever encountered we have destroyed. this is how we build our emipire.&quot; THe alien said &quot;but we will let you live so you can warn your people for a much more entertianing fight&quot;
<br />&quot;how do you know were we are?&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;we tracked your engine patterns and lead us right to were you launched.&quot; The alien said
<br />
<br />Lixin turuned tto his crew
<br />
<br />&quot;well any ideas?&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;yes&quot; Derik said &quot;we could break into there ship and steal the info from them the escape and not go home. we continuie on our mission after a while they won't be able to track us.&quot;
<br />&quot; you realize one of us has to break into that battleship sneak into centreal command and download high profile info escape and be chased around the galaxy by angry aliens&quot; Mark yelled
<br />&quot;well does anyone else have any ideas?&quot; Lixin asked ' no one okay then. mark you and me will board the ship. Derik if anything goes wrong get out of here and don't go home. we will destroy that data at all costs.&quot;
<br />&quot;man i dont know if i want to go...&quot; Mark said
<br />&quot;who said you had a choice&quot; Lixin replied &quot;Derik dock on the ship now!&quot;
<br />
<br />The starfinder slowly lowered itelf onto the alien battleship. Mark and Lixin jumped down and found themself in a small empty hallway. they bth drew there pistols and started to walk down the hall.
<br />
<br />&quot;get down&quot; Lixin whispered &quot;Guards ahead&quot;
<br />&quot;Derik said that through that door is a aceptable computer terminal to download from&quot; Mark said
<br />&quot;how do we get pas the guards?&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;hmm i dont know... lets see.. SHOOT THEM.&quot; Mark replied
<br />
<br />Lixin jumped out and shot one of them  with his pistol he took cover behing a container.
<br />
<br />&quot;he's running for the alarm&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;run with a laser in your ass&quot; Mark yelled as he shot the alien
<br />
<br />Lixin ran in and started tapping buttons on the terminal.
<br />
<br />&quot;hurry Lixin hurry!&quot;  Mark said
<br />&quot;almost done just one more minute..&quot; Lixin said

<br />
<br />&quot;welcome aboard Mr. uh what was it yes Mr.Lixin&quot; The alien said &quot;i am afraid that the info on were you came from must stay aboard for reason well that you have seen..&quot;
<br />&quot;why do you kill as a way of life.&quot; Lixin asked
<br />&quot;becuase those wo cannot fight deserve to die.&quot; The alien Said
<br />&quot;then fight me hand to hand!&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;hmm fight a weak perosn or have a great conquest i choose. destroying your race.&quot; The alien Replied
<br />
<br />Mark smiled and pointed a gun to the aliens head. 
<br />&quot;to bad you'll be dead&quot; Mark said then he fired the gun.Lixin grabbed his Guard and snapped his neck. Lixin quikly finished downloading and removing there  data on the colonies. he took the item containing the data and shot it. he hit his arm comunicater.
<br />
<br />&quot;Starfinder get out of here now!. thats  a order.&quot; Lixin yelled
<br />&quot;yes sir&quot; Derik said &quot;meet you in hell, buddy&quot;
<br />&quot;Lixin we need to take two fighters of theres and use the torpedos to destroy this ship. even though we destroyed the data it might not be fully deleted and could be recovered.&quot; Mark said
<br />
<br />The rwo ran down the hall when a group of aliens ambushed them. they both ducked behind corners. and started shooting. Lixin nailed a lien dead in the head. Mark got one in the chest but was hit in the shoulder.
<br />
<br />&quot;one more you want him Lixin&quot; Mark Yelled
<br />&quot;Like hell i do Mark. Lixin said
<br />
<br />Lixin jumped in the air and with his two pistols started firing rapidly hiting the alien 4 times. 
<br />
<br />&quot;from the map Derik gave us the hangar should be through the big door on your left.&quot; Lixin said
<br />&quot;to get in it Requires a code&quot; Mark said
<br />&quot;i'll give it one hell of a code&quot; Lixin said as he placed a bomb on the door. &quot;get down!&quot;
<br />
<br />The door blew open and they wlked into a room filled with over two hundered fighters.
<br />
<br />&quot;oh my god.... lets hope they never find our home.&quot; Lixin said 
<br />
<br />The two ships left the alien battleship. 
<br />
<br />&quot;readying torpedos&quot; Mark said
<br />&quot;lets hope this works&quot; Lixin said
<br />
<br />They both fired the torpedos but it seemed to have no effect on the ship. Alien fighters started to leave the ship in the dozens.
<br />
<br />&quot;lets get the hell outa here&quot; Lixin cried
<br />
<br />With that the two fighters burned out of there.</div>
