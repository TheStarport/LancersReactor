			<div class="content">Greetings Browclopsians and visistors...
<br />
<br />I would like to note right now that the rules of the server are not bendable for anyone.
<br />When it says, no modding/hacking/cheating... it means.... no modding/hacking/cheating. 
<br />
<br />Now for the last one there. Cheating. Use of anything not part of fair combat. This server
<br />considers F1'ing to be cheating, and punishable under the same pretences as any modder.
<br />
<br />I felt the need to bring them up because of the vast amount of whinning going on about it. 
<br />
<br />If you play on Browclopsia,  you run the risk of dying. You load up a storage character, you better
<br />be damn prepared to defend yourself... or be really careful before loading it up. They are fair targets.
<br />Frieghters with Cargo, are fair targets. If you fly, your a fair target. Be ready to defend yourself at 
<br />a moments notice.
<br />
<br />And now onto a realated issue. Over the past month or so I've been hearing over and over again
<br />&quot;you better not do this, the Admin will ban you&quot; Or &quot;I'll get the admin to ban you.&quot; Never say it 
<br />again. Its of extreme annoyance and makes me look bad personally. So far no one on this server
<br />has been banned expect &quot;I_am_a_modder&quot; and the OWL clan. (Who was banned from Elite ages ago, managed to 
<br />exceeded my tolerance for their anitics, and lack of respect for the assumement of others. And sortly after
<br />getting banned from Browclopsia, managed to get banned from yet another server, Jolt.) Threating people
<br />with my wrath because you don't like something they are doing that does not go beyond the server
<br />rules won't be tolerated. A firm verbal lashing will be handed out to the next person that does it.
<br />
<br />If you do see someone breaking the server rules, the correct way to handle it is too email me with the proof, and
<br />simply caution other players about them till I have a chance to review the proof and take the correct action. 
<br />
<br />That is all. I hope I never have to use the big soap box again to this group of people. 
<br />
<br />~Meiyo_Chie</div>

<br />
<br />
<br />Moron, OWL is not banned from elite, check your inteligence again, the jolt admins that banned my clan resigned a week later for all the bad image they were giving the company that was hosting the server they worked for, because like you, they banned lots of folks due to extremely biased conducts and i exposed that, and their heads rolled away, what you did was extremely unethic in the administration ethical point of view of things that should and shouldnt be done and your server will carry that stain forever, quoting someone i know, you're a lazy, biazed and incompetent admin, and quite sincerely you dont even know the truth about what happened in brow, or maybe you do wich makes it even worse, and btw that modders will be banned, no exceptions is false too, your browclops friends modded like hell in front of your nose on that day my clan was banned, they are still online, we are not, so please spare everyone of us further BS and shut the f... up, your server faith is sealed, thanks to you <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />PS- Quoting another person i know, the original browclops should sue you for you using his name on that freak aberration you call a server

			<div class="content">&quot;Mordred has kicked righteous butt in creating this server. My hat is off to him. I was in a tourney last night (which I lost in the first round, cause I suck!) and had a blast. I think Mordred could have taken me blindfolded. Nav boy was stunning, Pitt, Pwnisher (lol) and BlitzRaven all contributed to the carnage as well. Navigation Boy won, I should add, but it was so fast I missed it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> I hope to see lots of people there.

<br />Browclops&quot;
<br />
<br />And in responce to the OWL bannings...
<br />
<br />&quot;When children get out of hand, there must be discipline of some kind. Some children find they can play sort of a private game, one that involves making others miserable while they, and perhaps a few like-minded albeit witless friends, tag along. When this happens, it is best to remove those children from the playground and let them play elsewhere.
<br />
<br />This is, after all, a game. If 10% are having fun, and 90% are not having fun as a direct result of the 10%, then by god the 10% can go somewhere else and be miserable (inside themselves, of course). This may be too deep for some people, sadly it is those people that need to realize it the most. 
<br />
<br />Meiyo_Chie, I applaud you.
<br />
<br />Browclops&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Your selective reading skills amaze me. It amazes me that NE* would take you in like they have after the blantent insult you through at them repeatedly in these forums. I respect NE*, they are excellent pilots and to be honest, I like them and their personality. I am on Elite often and you'd never know it. I've never once had a verbal conversation with them I didn't like. You respect them they respect you. Anyways, talking about NE* is forbidden at LR I think... so I guess I will be silent.
<br />
<br />Also I know who your quoting, I read the clan forums. Opinions of single a single man do not bother me. The needs of of the many out weigh the needs of the few, or the one, Cleaver. 
<br />
<br />We'd like it if you stayed out of our thread, you don't play on this server anymore and we would like to keep it on topic.</div>

<br />
<br />I stay firm on my comment, either you have no idea of what happened, or youre just being plain hipocrit, since day one folks like justimian tried to turn the entire server on us, 2 or 3 folks were lobbiying for that, dameclops, justimian and another guy i dont remember the nick, on day one (the same day we had a healthy and friendly conversation in gamma with AE pinkie and Nav boy, wich involved friendly duelings etc) i get to see posted on every browclops related forums comments like &quot;kill them all, lets do some owl hunting, lets make some owl puree or fricasee&quot; and comments on the NE* boards &quot;come help us OWL hunting etc&quot;, the server got down and this messages kept spawning on every browclops forums like mushrooms, the funny thing is, they were made by 2 or 3 guys that had some personal problem with me and were dragging the server and clans into a war with us; i tried to reason with everyone with great patience but good folks like justimian kept erazing every goodwill thread we posted, posts like &quot;hi from owl, cant we be friends etc&quot; were all erazed by justimian, justimian attitude led to the crumbling of AE, it was never our fault; yeah, at that time my patience was wearing very thin with justimian, that due to his actions became kill on sight list on elite and every server with ne* or allies around.
<br />When browclops gets back up, i try to get along with everyone, on theta everyone insults me, i ignore them, next day dame clops starts spreading that we cheat and use speed hacks, (that made neo hairy banned) i try to speak with her and she insults me with sentences like &quot;your clan is a joke, and youre an idiot&quot; (at that time i never flamed anyone from browclops), i get tired my patience runs out and i declare war on her (interpreted as a wide war on server due to US<img src=smilies/icon_smile_blackeye.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> after that we start atacking folks that disrespected us on the past, you log in, start acting as a middle men (grouped with them), and they start cheating on our very eyes, and you never moved a finger, we decide to move to another server and everyone logs out at the same time, next day everyone is permabanned.
<br />
<br />Im curious, what was the dramatic version you got to know? or there simply is no version at all? You need to hold a leash on your pathetic band of users, for the reputation of your server sake, using owl as an escape goat will not do the trick.
<br />
<br />Regarding me not posting here, if i see an ofensive and unfair remark to owl i will defend my self, and anyway, i have a character on browclops (yes bans on freelancer are so futile) so i can post here as a browclops player, sorry m8, your ban was uncalled for, so i wont respect it and wont help you enforce it, and no one will shut me up regarding unfair agendas, thats how i work, i wont budge untill i see some results
<br />
<br />
<br />Regarding OWL and NE* relationship, OWL IS NE*, you just dont know half of the story, very ancient story, so stop being a fool, and pay more attention to some clan history and FL facts happening outside browclops

			<div class="content">It wasn't anything you did that Night that got you banned Cleaver.
<br />
<br />It was a post you made on a forum insulting the server in general. Basically you over generalized, and I didn't care for that very much. The community was still in a fragil state and waves caused by OWL weren't very much helping at the time. It was with extreme regret that I banned you. (because you didn't really break the rules as I pointed out in the post addressing your ban when it first happened) And I'm happy you have an account here, I hope you can add to the community. 
<br />
<br />As for modding finger pointing... I have screenshots sent to me by trusted players of NE* appearing to do the same thing... and for the same reason I didn't ban the Brow regulars, I wrote them off as lag. I know neither group cheats. The real reason I banned Hairy at first (later unbanned that same day) is I thought he might have been another imposter. 
<br />
<br />And recently the server has been getting some lag due to the canadian company in Calargy that provides our T1 service is going to crap. The issue is being resolved though.
<br />
<br />I do have to say I'm sorry for people threating you and NE* with bans in my name, I only recently found out abou that and got proof of it... promting my above post not to do it again.

<br />
<br />Anyway, all seems settled then, thanks for the fine reply, i wont be adressing browclops in negative terms from now on, good luck on it, hope all bodes well with B-clops

			<div class="content">Meiyo is biased alright.  He is biased in the way that everyone is.  Bias is not a vice, it is a common trait shared by anyone who lives their lives in only one body.  I have a list of personal biases myself.  I am biased against cheating.  I am biased against racism.  I am also biased against hanging around servers where name-calling and flaming is the common mode of communication.  Actually, I hate all three of these, and refuse to play in an environment that harbors them.  I am not biased against killing though, or pk'ing.  I love that stuff.
<br />
<br />Fortunately, on browclopsia, the admin shares the same biases I do.  When someone cheats, they are punted.  When someone repeatedly makes racial slurs, they are punted.  When someone tries to turn the player interactions on the server into a large flame war, and posts things like &quot;We are going to destroy the server&quot; then they are...  well, you get the picture.  I resigned from AE because I did not want to be personally represented by a flame fest.  I'm biased against it.  I think you can see where this is going.  Flaming, name calling etc. is not a personal luxury.  In most real world situations you will be removed for this kind of thing.  I see people fired from my company every month for the same reason.  You may not be able to be arrested for it, but you do get excluded from social situations for it.  I can't imagine inviting a **** to my poker night, for example.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I didn't actually read all of any of your posts cleaver, no offense, but I don't see what relevance you have on the server now.  I'm trying to pick things out that are important to me to read.
