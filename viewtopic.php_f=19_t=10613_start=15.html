			<div class="content">Thank you for your reply GKFC, people who have been PK'ed act as if they are the ONLY one's to be PK'ed.  I have been PK'ed lots of time by people who demand $ to get to certain points.  Do I write to the Admin about it?  No.  Because it's not self-satisfying for me to know that certain player got banned.  I'd rather level up, and PK that same person who PK'ed me.  But I guess different people have different views.

			<div class="content">@deucy,
<br />
<br />You <b> didn't  </b> say it was kewl, it was I that said it was &quot;boring&quot; and was in directly response/rebuttal to your own words:
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />your intitled to your opinion, but banning someone for a kill in liberty would mean half the universe gone, that would be boring=/
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I don't mind people trying to quote me, but don't take my words out of context and reshuffle them.  That's just wrong regardless of your country of origin.  Assuming the PK'ing is going to happen in Liberty on the &quot;carebear&quot; Elite server?   Maybe, but not on my watch.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Granted we're not going to catch every infraction, but it helps when pilots do some self-policing and bring an incident to the attn of the server admins and let us deal with it.  Sounds to me like SSTrunks was operating well within the rules anyway.  
<br />
<br />If you're outside of the Liberty Space (NY, TX, COL. Cal.) then you are fair game!</div>

It would just weed out all the a$$holes. And no, the a$$holes dont make up half the server. 
<br /> 
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>and what's wrong with being able to bring your char to another server? toughen up for cryin out loud.. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>Whats wrong with levelling the playing field and giving new players a chance? Are you that afraid of a level playing field?
<br /> 
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>I did go past SadisticSavior, and did I PK him? No I did not.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>Then I apologize for accusing you. You were following me and I assumed it was you. However I admit, I didnt actually SEE you shoot at me. And there were other (hostile NPC) ships present.
<br /> 
<br />80% of the time, when I encounter another high level player, they've tried to kill me. So assuming I am being attacked by default has been a safe assumtpion for the most part so far. 
<br /> 
<br />Since there are (absurdly IMO) virtually NO penalties for dying in a fighter in this game, it was just an annoyance...I was trying to get somewhere and getting blown up meant I had to start again. There really needs to be more penalties for dying as a fighter...the game is balanced in favor of fighting over trading. I really cant understand what the incentive is to trade in this game, especially at low levels.
<br /> 
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>By the way, anyone wanna gimmie a list of what is and isn't part of Liberty system. I don't want to be banned again for shooting down people who think PK'ing is wrong. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>If the system says &quot;Liberty space&quot; when you first jump in, then thats Liberty space.
<br /> 
<br />The only time I've been killed in Liberty space was by some a$$hole named &quot;Ultima_Weapon&quot;. He was lane hacking. I was in a Defender at the time, and he was in what looked like a loaded falcon or Eagle. He got me twice (camped at the same point on a tradelane). I got around it the 3rd time by using cruise engines instead. Tip for all you newbies out there...PCs can only 'see' you to about 3 or 4k, then you vanish off radar. If you can avoid cruise disruptors for about 10 seconds (yes, it's possible...dodging them takes practice), you're home free.
<br /> 
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>all I know is I have been killed at rank-1 by 38's, it sucks I know but life goes on..and these guys usually wind up helping people out in the end sooner or later. banning someone from a cool server where they took hrs to build a char is tough=/ after you kill me I WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN when I'm rank 25-30 or so <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>I dont favor ANY limitations on PKing normally. If the police were as strong as they should be (realistically speaking), then PKing wouldnt be an issue. The &quot;rule&quot; is in place because of a design flaw in the game.  Christ, if the FL universe were real, the criminals would be running the government.
<br /> 
<br />I totally agree with how the admins handle banning people...it's one of the reasons I will only play on Elite, even though it takes years to get on sometimes. I dont think anyone should be banned on a first offense, but there needs to be a harsh incentive not to grief new players.</div>

<br />
<br />If you see about 5-7 ppl in the Omicron Theta system and there are death messages occuring every 5 seconds or so, chances are there's a brawl going on over there.  If you want to just have some fun engaging in a little pvp just head over to the Freeport 9 area.  Sometimes it's just fun to watch and get some cool screenshots.  Just thought I'd let you know.

			<div class="content">Yea, Trunks. The FIRST time to PK'ed all of us was in the Cortez system. BUT, we just entered the Jump Gate to Cali when you PKed us all again. And THATS when you chased Wretched all the way to New York. 
<br />
<br />So, you want to be a dick? That's fine. All it did was ruin our night and make me not want to play FL at all online again. It's not like we were a challenge. It's not like our meager cargo was really worth anything to you. But, it meant a lot to us. I've played online a bit but that was Wretched and Zeno's first time playing. You knew we weren't a challenge for you after the first time you PK'ed us. So, the only conclusion that I can make is that you are are griefer. You get off on ****ing with &quot;noobs.&quot; GJ. Nice playing with you. I also didn't see you talk to us afterwards and &quot;help us out.&quot; 
<br />
<br />We DID get PK'ed in Cali. It's a risk we took but we thought we made it to a safe zone. We spent the last of our money to try and make the trade run again. I'm just pissed about what happened and I'm reporting someone who broke the rules.

<br />That was pretty lame Durtee, sounds like you lied about him killing you in Liberty. Just seems sort of pathetic to me that you need to log on to TLR and not only whine about someone killing you, but you also need to lie about it.</div>

			<div class="content">Durtee, all your doing is whining and calling me names.  Pretty sad if you ask me, yet I laugh at you.  Maybe I'll go cry to an admin for your name calling. =)  You my friend, are NO challenge, nor shall ever be to me, so I laugh once more at you.  What's pretty lame to me, is that a simply point of finger can equal to an automatic ban.  I thought we were advanced a bit since the Salem Witch Trials, but I guess I was proven wrong.  Durtee, all you did was pretty much make people realize that they're risking a ban when they PK you even when they're not within the Liberty system.  If it's that EASY to get ban, maybe I should get 2 other friends and say YOU PK'ed me within the system.  You know as well as anyone that there ARE actual people that PK within the system, why not report them instead of me?  Because I caused you to lose all your money?  Boo hoo, I was hauling 250 diamonds worth of cargo from Texas to New York and was PK'ed by a very famous PK'er, Ultimate_Weapon simply because I REFUSED to pay him $5K.  I put all my money towards buying those diamonds just to lose them within minutes.  Well you know what?  Boo hoo for me.  If you don't like PK'ers, then like others have said, go to a care bare server, where you don't have to worry about anyone/anything.  I play by the rules, and if you don't like how I play, tuff, either dock as soon as you see my name within ur system, or cruise your ship on out of my way because as I stated before, if your NOT within Liberty space, I'm shooting everything I got at you.

<br />Good Day To You,

			<div class="content"><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>So, you want to be a dick? That's fine. All it did was ruin our night and make me not want to play FL at all online again. It's not like we were a challenge. It's not like our meager cargo was really worth anything to you. But, it meant a lot to us.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>I have to admit, I can sympathize with this. I still think pvp should be a free-for-all outside liberty space. But when you're in the middle of a mission or hauling cargo, being attacked by bored players can be very annoying.
<br /> 
<br />The solution IMO is simple...dont fight back. They are attacking because they are bored. Make the experience as boring as possible for them. Also, if you trapped at a dock, try to run away as far from your spawn point as possible...I did this in Omicron Theta last night. I didnt feel like fighting because I was trying to complete a 100k mission. So I made it to cruise mode and led them to a jump hole and went in. On the other side I sat there and let them destroy me. Of course I lost absolutely nothing, respawned instantly, and went on with my mission free of further annoyance. V'iola. 
<br /> 
<br />PKing is a nuisance you'll have to learn to live with. The one thing you do NOT want to do is draw attention to them, because attention is exactly what they want. Dont even say anything to them. Ignoring someone who is griefing you is definitly the one thing most likely to piss them off. 
<br /> 
<br />If you are killed in Liberty space, do all of the above, then report them to the admin. It says right there in the server description &quot;Do not PK in Liberty space&quot;. It doesnt say &quot;except for duels&quot; or &quot;except when you're bored&quot;. If they dont like the rules, there are plenty of servers out there that are FFA. 
<br />

They can ban you if you refuse to cooperate.
<br /> 
<br />Which is why I personally believe SSTrunks didnt know.  Even if, in my case, he did attack me it would have been legal in my case....I was in Jap space at the time. 
<br /> 
<br />Ultima_Weapon attacked my in Liberty space twice though. I'm sure it's no accident that the only people he seems to attack are those with vastly inferior equipment. I didnt report him then, because I didnt really care. If he had annoyed me enough, I would have tho.
<br /> 
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>How would anyone know deucey? Can't get on that server any easier than Elite so what's the point? Boring to sit there and ping the server over and over and over and over and never connect. Probably almost as boring as everyone being a level 38 on all servers... (yawn) <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>Exactly...yet there are people on this forum who actually WANT to be able to move their level 38 character anywhere? heh heh...yeah right. Talk about boring.</div>
