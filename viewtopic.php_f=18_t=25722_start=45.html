			<div class="content">Hey! Speaking of the Russian space program, how about Soyuz as the name for a Russian House freighter?
<br />
<br />I will also note, that although the Russian spacecraft are older and less &quot;advanced&quot; than the US's whenever we have to shut down the space program because of tragedys like the Challenger and Columbia, we never worry if we have people already up in space at places like Mir or the ISS, because, after all, the Russians will go and bring them home for us, in their &quot;crappy&quot; but reliable space-craft.
<br />
<br />*G* And when the Russians didn't have the money or time to redesign their guidance programs for the capsules that brought theri guys down to earth, and one such mis-landing had two Cosmonauts surrounded by hungry wolves (true story), from then on they very practally equipped all such landers with a shotgun and ammo!
<br />
<br />Of course whatever you've lost is in the last place you look. Why would you keep looking after you've found what you lost?

			<div class="content"><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>As it goes, remember. The american NASA space agency spent tens of millions of pounds designing a pen that writes on nearly anything, and underwater in zero gravity.
<br />The russians just use a pencil.
<br />Simple, efficient, and JUST AS GOOD. However, it cost nothing realatively.
<br />Limits like cost don't mean worse, they just mean more creativity. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />A very amusing anecdote, I must admit, until I found out about the truth: pencil is an absolute nightmare to use in zero-g. I quote:
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>When the astronauts began to fly, like the Russians, they used pencils, but the leads sometimes broke and became a hazard by floating in the [capsule's atmosphere where there was no gravity. They could float into an eye or nose or cause a short in an electrical device. In addition, both the lead and the wood of the pencil could burn rapidly in the pure oxygen atmosphere. Paul Fisher realized the astronauts needed a safer and more dependable writing instrument, so in July 1965 he developed the pressurized ball pen, with its ink enclosed in a sealed, pressurized ink cartridge. Fisher sent the first samples to Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Houston Space Center. The pens were all metal except for the ink, which had a flash point above 200&#176;C. The sample Space Pens were thoroughly tested by NASA. They passed all the tests and have been used ever since on all manned space flights, American and Russian. All research and developement costs were paid by Paul Fisher. No development costs have ever been charged to the government. 
<br />
<br />Because of the fire in Apollo 1, in which three Astronauts died, NASA required a writing instrument that would not burn in a 100% oxygen atmosphere. It also had to work in the extreme conditions of outer space: 
<br />1. In a vacuum. 
<br />2. With no gravity. 
<br />3. In hot temperatures of +150&#176;C in sunlight and also in the cold shadows of space where the temperatures drop to -120&#176;C 
<br />(NASA tested the pressurized Space Pens at -50&#176;C, but because of the residential [sic heat in the pen it also writes for many minutes in the cold shadows.) 
<br />
<br />Fisher spent over one million dollars in trying to perfect the ball point pen before he made his first successful pressurized pens in 1965. Samples were immediately sent to Dr. Robert Gilruth, Manager of the Houston Space Center, where they were thoroughly tested and approved for use in Space in September 1965. In December 1967 he sold 400 Fisher Space Pens to NASA for $2.95 each. 
<br />
<br />Lead pencils were used on all Mercury and Gemini space flights and all Russian space flights prior to 1968. Fisher Space Pens are more dependable than lead pencils and cannot create the hazard of a broken piece of lead floating through the gravity-less atmosphere. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

			<div class="content">Hey, new here, this cought my eye, so I decided to register.
<br />
<br />Someone suggested Dr. Shivago influence, and so I have to suggest the use of one of the coolest character's ever be recognized. If anyone remembers the film, right before the first intermission, Shivago's son asks his mother &quot;Mother, are their <i> wolves </i> in the forest?&quot; It immediately cuts to show a HUGE red train speed down a side track, and then cuts to the front of the train, where Strelnikov stands, watching over the train's movement.
<br />
<br />As such I suggest a freighter/transports to be called either &quot;Wulf&quot; or &quot;Strelnikov&quot;
<br />Hell, I'd love to see an actual leader named after him.
<br />
<br />Anyway. Nice to be part of the community.

			<div class="content">So, what kind of economic situation does the Russian House have? I mean, does it support a major industrial faction like Samura or the IMG (etc)? Does it have a planet or planets that support major agriculture? (Hummmm... Ukraine System, Planet Kiev? The Ukraine is historically rich farmland right?). It would be good to have a few things that one could by cheap in &quot;Russia&quot; and could sell high elsewhere, and vice versa, for those of us who occasionally enjoy a trading run or three. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />Or, if they are allied with the Corsairs, maybe they produce something that Omicron Gamma doesn't, but needs. Maybe a Cardimine link between the Outcasts and a Russian faction (Organizatsiya, anyone?).
<br />
<br />I was also thinking the famous Corsair &quot;Road to Rhineland&quot; stuff that you always see in the news at Corsair ports.... perhaps the Russia House is involved in that? Perhaps part of the mod is a Rhineland System (I forgat which system was first on the Corsair's list) already fallen into the Corsairs/Russian hands. Wreckage, a few military bases/battleships, constant fighting between Russo-Corsair forces and Rhinelanders?
<br />
<br />Just some thoughts...</div>
