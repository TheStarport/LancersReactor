			<div class="content">Topics about war are not tolerated in this forum, theres been hundreds of post on the war on iraq, i mean, dont you ever realize whenever you post something on the war its locked instantly by the responsible and courteous staff of of The Lancers Reactor. Seriously people, first, politics is a giant waste of time in general, as you cannot affect it in any way by agreeing or disagreeing with any of it. Second, theres many people here that arent from the united states, albeit most are, there are quite a few that arent, hell, there could be people from Iraq in these forums. I think its very immature and uncalled for to be posting posts about how you like saddam was hurt, or how its great that american soldiers are taking lives, i dont want to hear that, and FYI, im not pro-american or pro-iraqi. Will people ever realize that the political situation is nothing to be proud of, you think its right under any circumstance to take someone life simply because of things they did in the past, Taking a life is not easy to deal with, nor is it a honorable or heroic deed. 
<br />
<br />Under any circumstance, no matter what a person does, it still does not give him the penalty of being killed by one other, imagine if the world were run by people like this. Imagine a guy becoming ruler, and declaring that all homosexuals be executed immediately, or that all black, white, or hispanic people were to be hunted down and purged from the united states. Set your prejudice aside, you cant change crooked politics and war, you cant change anything, your just a tiny, insignificant number in the world, leading a little boring life and then you die. Because humans are the scum of the universe, why is it that as soon as we started to walk this planet, first we figured out a way to survive, then a way to divide and judge each other, and after creating tools to hunt food with immediately after created weapons to kill each other with. If this is the best the universe has to offer than it is truly.....well....just truly...sickening and disgusting.
<br />
<br />No man deserves death, not even saddam hussein, how do you even KNOW he did what he did, how is everyone 200% sure that it definitly wasnt crooked politics and propaganda, but simply that &quot;he did it&quot;. Theres gotta be more to it than that, and calling him a murderer wont solve anything, he murdered thousands yes, sure, but the U.S.A murdered millions when they a-bombed japan. So that makes them even in many ways, because im sick of people telling me how its his fault and he is to blame &quot;simply because&quot; to tell you the truth. I cant believe a whole nation, and so many people dont think about it, how do you people not know that maybe everything about him was a lie to have a excuse to attack, maybe it wasnt, now dont get me wrong, im not defending him, i just dont enjoy being told by some A$$hole about how hes proud to be a part of a country which is targeting saddam and his 2 young sons (as posted earlier, aparently both of them were killed or injured) how can people be so bloodthirsty to even be able to withstand hearing children being bombed and killed.
<br />
<br />For god sakes people, look at things on a broader perspective, people are so narrow minded these days it makes me sick, nobody bothers to look at it in different factors, and on a broader scale, but no, everyone simply gets blinded and brainwashed then go around salting their smarts out to other people &quot;just because hes guilty&quot;. My whole family was murdered by a single american bomb in the bombing of yugoslavia 1999, but you dont see me going around internet forums telling everyone how bad america is, do you? And no, i dont hold any grudge against them, as it was a high chance it was a mistake (which i doubt, because many other civilian targets were bombed, including a childrens hospital, and national monuments and churches) but yet even though i should be full of hatred, i instead choose to let even my enemies redeem themselves. And i cant flippin stand people telling me how great they are, i dont like them, i dont hate them, and most of the time i dont agree with them, yet it still doesnt mean i should hate them.
<br />
<br />And while im on the subject, you should go check out this article:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.totse.com/en/politics/political_spew/awarmongerexpl169226.html">http://www.totse.com/en/politics/politi ... 69226.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />which should explain that things are not always as they seem, and just because our leaders decide its right doesnt mean their right, maybe that article will make you think, maybe it will just make you flame me. I dont care, read it, enjoy it, and hopefully learn something from it, im out.....Peace

			<div class="content">Comont, I completely agree with your 1st paragraph. But you should've stopped there. The rest of your post is contradicting the intelligent part.

<br />
<br />Sounds like another political discussion: is death sentence civil or not?
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Imagine a guy becoming ruler, and declaring that all homosexuals be executed immediately, or that all black, white, or hispanic people were to be hunted down and purged from the united states. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Jingoism vs minorities. Political.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>No man deserves death, not even saddam hussein, how do you even KNOW he did what he did, how is everyone 200% sure that it definitly wasnt crooked politics and propaganda, but simply that &quot;he did it&quot;. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />You're saying that he does not deserve death. But many others believe otherwise. This very statement IS a political discussion, no?
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>My whole family was murdered by a single american bomb in the bombing of yugoslavia 1999, but you dont see me going around internet forums telling everyone how bad america is, do you? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Up until now, apparently. I'm truly sorry about your family, but by using &quot;murder&quot; to describe the tragedy, you ARE implying that America is &quot;bad&quot;, since EVERYONE agrees that murder is an evil thing. 
<br />
<br />About your link:
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>WM: It's not just about UN resolutions. The main point is that Iraq could have weapons of mass destruction, and the first sign of a smoking gun could well be a mushroom cloud over New York.
<br />
<br />PN: Mushroom cloud? But I thought the weapons inspectors said Iraq had no nuclear weapons. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Not a very objective site. The &quot;Warmonger&quot; is displayed as an idiot who keeps contradicting himself.
<br />
<br />My conclusion is that you are against war. I'm not saying that you are pro-Iraq, I'm just saying that you are against war, which is cool with me and everyone else in the forum, but why are you protesting the making of political statements while you are making your own political statements? If anything, you are as wrong as the person who stated that he likes to see Saddam dead.
