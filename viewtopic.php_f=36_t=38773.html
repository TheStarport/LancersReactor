			<div class="content">Hi all, I tried logging on to your server yesterday only to find I had been banned.
<br />My online names are TheShrike! and gosling.  The reason given for TheShrike! ban is 'autobanned by Ioncross for ship related cheats'.
<br />Well, I am here to tell you that Ioncross is wrong.  I do not have any cheats, and I do not have any idea how to use a cheat!  I am very computer illiterate and would not know what a cheat was if one jumped up and shook me by the hand.
<br />So, could you please check into this for me as I am very much looking forward to playing this mod.
<br />The other name under which I am banned is gosling; and no reason is given for this ban, but I imagine it must have something to do with Ioncross again.
<br />Your Ioncross is wrong again.  Please look into this for me as I am very disappointed and not a little annoyed about this situation.  
<br />I have been playing Freelancer since its release and this is the first time I have ever been banned for no reason and also the first time my name has appeared in connection with cheating.
<br />A point of law I should make clear to you, just in passing, is that the law regarding libelling someone in public is very serious.  I have checked this with several people I know who work in the legal field.
<br />Please be aware that labelling someone a cheat is libel.  And even more so if it turns out that you are wrong.  Be aware of what you are doing and saying.  I am very easygoing about this, but I know people who are not so understanding.
<br />Please check into this situation with Ioncross and let me know why it claims I am cheating.
<br />Thank you.
<br />Sincerely,
<br />Bob Short aka TheShrike!</div>

<br />
<br />Ok... um... I do not play WTS, nor do I work for this mod team... but basically:
<br />
<br />1.  Getting banned for cheating on a server that you do not own does not, in fact, constitute &quot;libel&quot;- it's a situation that's no different than having an ISP bounce your email because your computer's full of viruses.
<br />
<br />It  <i>does </i> mean that you've violated the EULA (y'know, the &quot;terms and conditions&quot; ) of the server, as well as Microsoft- or at least... IONCROSS thinks so.  Get a clue- cheaters who get banned from a server aren't having their rights violated... legally-speaking, they're having their rights terminated, because they didn't act in accordance with the rules of the server.  
<br />
<br />So... take a deep breath and calm down, k?  If you're that confused about your rights and responsibilities concerning playing online... your claims to not know anything about cheating are, if anything, more credible <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />2.  IONCROSS frequently behaves this way after large server updates, because players are carrying equipment that's been changed by the new mod.  This is often the cause of a &quot;player wipe&quot;, and hopefully Crabtree will get things straightened out right away.
<br />
<br />I would humbly suggest... that for now, you just create a new character, and try not to have too many hard feelings about this.  Crabtree's mod is extensive enough that this last major update may require a player wipe, although he's been pretty careful about such things in the past.</div>

<br />
<br />Well, I haven't laughed that hard for a week or so... If you really believe that, get speaking to a real lawyer... spreading a good joke is great <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I suggest contacting the server admin directly, as this forum is not the place for antics over bannings (including discussions of admins decisions etc). They don't have to unban you even if you didn't cheat - so being polite and nice is alot better than throwing around <b>that </b> kind of threat!</div>

			<div class="content">Dear ROFLMAO, I love that  acronym; whenever I see it I always imagine someone rolling around on the floor with their butt cheeks in their hand and laughing in despair...
<br />Anyway ROFLMAO thanks for the response.  And let me point I an not furious, I am 'not a little annoyed' about this situation.   
<br />Also, I did send an email to the email contact on crabtrees website, but had it returned for some reason...I have no idea why,,,and as for logging on under a different name, well I can't even get into the server because my I.P has been banned.  
<br />Now, legal issues: when I was trying to find out why I had been banned, I had a friend of mine, who was lawyer, with me at the time.  When she saw that I had been banned 'for using a ship cheat' and therefore classed as cheater she said in that awful bloody lawyer tone of voice 'I could sue them for saying that'.
<br />Which made me laugh and question how serious she was.  Very, or so it seems.  In her words, 'we would be making legal history'.   
<br />So I asked a couple of people about it and two others said yes and two said no.
<br />Reread what a wrote.  I mentioned to the effect some people would not take it 
<br />and would be annoyed enough to seek legal council, yeah, seriously they would, which is one reason why I posted the email.
<br />They may not have won a case but they would have stirred up lots of trouble...yes, there are people who would do it for that reason alone.
<br />Anyway, for me it was a frustrating experience not being able to even get into the server and change my name, which is also the reason I made that posting.
<br />So ROFLMAO thanks again for the posting; legal history will not be made, and we can all rest assured that you will be ready, fingers on keyboard, with a word to the wise...
<br />See you in cyberspace,
<br />Bob aka TheShrike!</div>
