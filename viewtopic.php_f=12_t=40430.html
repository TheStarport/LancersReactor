<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>By our standards, not theirs. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />What I meant was that the Roman culture did not fear death or see the subject as taboo as we do  today.  Often they celebrated a 'good' death.  Seeing so much death in their time would almost  certainly force them to accept it, thus making them much less resistant to the idea of killing  people, especially when they 'deserved' it.  That is why as many enjoyed the public executions as  they did the venationes and gladiatorial fights.  There was no excitement, it was just slaughter  for the sake of slaughter and they recognised it as such.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Exactly. And the punishment is unnecessarily bloody. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Thank you for proving my point <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />But let's look at WHY they are drenched in blood.  Is it because of the evil, bloodthirst  soldiers?  Or is it because rebellion tends to stay low-key and small if people live in constant  fear of their lives?  By brutally suppressing a population you safeguard your foothold in the  short term and sometimes the long term.  It's a nasty business, but it works.  Notice how badly  the US is doing in the Middle-East?  With the world's media watching they can hardly repress  revolt, they have to stick it out.  Not that that is a bad thing but you can see the results of  lending too much power to the people.  Give me one example of an empire that killed people for the  hell of it.  THAT is a bloodthirst empire.  Except the Assyrians, even they had motive but I can't  investigate something without any material. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Well, argue against it. Prove to me why I am wrong! <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />You think one thing, I have present my case for my opinion.  You don't agree.  I have neither the  time nor inclination to propound my views to you when you don't accept them now and so probably  never will.  There is no way I can prove anything to you without a degree in psychology, so if you  could wait a few years... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Ok. Humans have always a dual impulse towards the Absolute. We are drawn to it, for its  transcendence of the ego, and pushed away from it, for our innability to comprehend it through the  caging mental frame. When confronted with it, we choose one instinct or the other. In a situation  where we give in to terror, we lash out at the source; it one where we overcome terror, we deify  it.
<br />
<br />For example: Homosexuality in Christian society (post-doctrinization) is considered an evil, a  work of satan, bestial, depraved, to be condemned. Most other societies worldwide have not given  it at all the same amount of attention; in Mesopotamian society it was a non-issue (there are even  some homosexual references in the Epic of Gilgamesh); similarly it was barely considered in most  of Asia; in Greek society, of course, it was celebrated. But very often in shamanistic and native  cultures (most notably here in north america), homosexuality is not only viewed as that which  should be celebrated, but as holy. Homosexuals were, in a sense, deified.
<br />
<br />In Christian and native societies, homosexuality is looked at as liminal and therefore powerful.  The response is vastly different, of course. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />You are Absolutely (sic) right.  But Christians tend to miss the point with homosexuality.  It was  condemned because at the time of the bible's writing the population was still very small, and thus  homosexuality meant that men were being 'wasted' on each other instead of procreating with women.   Unfortunately, being hardline Christian enough to automatically hate homosexuals requires a hefty  sacrifice of logic, therefore they believe that hating homosexuality is the Will of God(tm).  This  provides motive and all the reason they need.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Ok, let's backtrack.
<br />We are terrified at the unknowable, apprehensive of the unknown.
<br />When we recognize a thing as being unknowable, we feel automatically terror and awe, the former  being the instinct we tend to proceed with.
<br />That which is liminal, falling between the boundaries of the mental frame, violating the purity  code, is recognized as unknowable.
<br />--ergo, we feel terror at the liminal, and attack it. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />I don't think we are terrified of the unknown.  We are certainly suspicious, which if fueled in  the wrong way can turn into fear and terror.  But that takes a lot of doing and external  intervention.  Terror and awe are far too strong to use in this example as basic feelings.   Certainly suspicion and curiosity would be experienced, however, which are more or less the same,  only weaker.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>See? The conversion of man and beast, again. The animal thinks by its instincts, without  compassion, pulling humans into the water and devouring them. But the monster, or so I saw when I  did an image search, is very often portrayed not as a mere beast but as a humanoid. Its bowing  portrays the anthropomorphism. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />True.  I agree with you here.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Let's try a more common monster: the werewolf. Wolves are fierce, bestial, strong, but  knowable, and for this reason by themselves do not truly inspire terror in the manner of a monster  that is both great beast and sentient man does. One cannot comprehend such a monster through the  frame complex, for it transcends such a thing. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />I don't think that's the case at all.  Werewolves would have been created in myths by man's  attempt to combine the most dangerous traits of animals with that of man himself.  The horror of  the werewolf comes from the idea of something feral and lethal possessing the intelligence of  humans.  Whether this was inspired by observing the intelligence of wolves in the wild or fears  and fantasies manifesting themselves in stories told to frighten children is hard to say.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>No. Show me why I'm wrong. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />I won't.  The same logic (I feel) applies here as further above.  If I am suggesting something  like that you can assume that I have no further elaborations on my argument that is relevant (name  calling, for instance <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) but am utterly convinced of its legitimacy and correctness.  There is no  way, it seems for me to convince you of my opinions in this area, so I will not waste our time  trying to discuss it.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Yes, but why are they scary to small children? Why are they even scary to adults? The  monsters are liminal. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />That may be so, but they are also scary because the adults are no better off in knowledge than  children when those stories were widespread and believed.  They only scare people properly if  those people have no science to rationalise or explain away as nonsense.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>So murder is not a basic instinct <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />You said this in your last post.
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>And once again, prove my original premise wrong. Misogeny, <b>murder </b>, bloodthirst, and  greed are NOT the basest instincts of humanity? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Now that we have knocked a second point down, that leaves misogyny and bloodlust.  Let's move on.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>So, the scale is this, going backwards:
<br />Murder --&gt; hatred --&gt; response to terror --&gt; terror and awe --&gt; stimulus (Unknowable)
<br />So murder is not a basic instinct, but it still is a direct branch of a basic instinct.
<br />And it still is base . I don't think that you disagree with that, considering you spent  considerable time denouncing historical murderers and showing that their atrocities were not  representative of humanity on the whole. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />As I have said I do not believe that terror and awe are really ideal for describing this.  You are  essentially correct in your scale but we still need external influences and pressures to move from  one stage to the next.  Because society is so full of these pressures and opinions that the  process could well seem natural and automatic, that isn't to say that it is.  And I only pointed  out that historical <i>murderers </i> were not representative of humanity as a whole.  We can  safely say that empires such as the Romans and the Assyrians (without any knowledge of this I  cannot analyse it) <i>are </i> representative of humanity.  I am talking about the crowds that oooh  and aaah at people killing each other in exciting ways, not Nero who burned down about a quarter  of Rome so he could build a new palace.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>I did say &quot;qualitative difference&quot;. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Okay, fair enough.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Misogyny will be a minority. But there will always be a half-man. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Yeah... I'm not quite clear what you mean by half-man, though.
<br />
<br />And the ball is back into your court.
<br />
<br />@Aliens, yes that seems to have worked.</div>

<br />
<br />Exactly my point. We are suspicious of the unknown; we are terrified of the unknowable. One can    be known: it is possible to comprehend within the mindframe. The other cannot    be known without the removal/fluidity of the frame. Humans are most stubborn about this, however, as the world saw with Cold War: both sides were absolutely inable to step away from their cultural worldviews, to look through the eyes of the other, and to view their own frame with objectivity.

<br />As per terror and awe, once again I am talking about that which isn't known and can't be, not that which isn't known and can be. To prove my point, I could give a tale of direct experience, but you'd think I was resorting to hyperbole and in any case direct experience is mistrusted. So I'll ask you a question:
<br />
<br />Have you ever had a dream (pardon me, I'm under the influence of C.G. Jung and Joseph Cambell) where you are confronted suddenly by a shapeless void, that slowly grows and creeps till it engulfs everything you see, and there is nothing but its depths? Or one where you are swimming in an ocean, and suddenly sucked down into the blackness, or the sun and surface dissapear and there is nothing but cold water everywhere you look? Or  one when you are running, being chased by something terrible but you cannot comprehend exactly what the thing is--you only know its awesome power?
<br />
<br />If not, I'll give you more rational and empirical examples, but the most effective method of proving one's point is calling on another's  direct experience. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />Exactly. Great beast and sentient man. It's liminal.
<br />
<br />By that I'd think you agree with me on the point about liminality and the terror involved in it. So why do you disagree on the point about the unknowable being so terrifying?
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>You said this in your last post.    <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Oy vey. I didn't mean basest as in &quot;basic&quot; I meant basest as in &quot;of a contemptible or selfish lack of human decency!&quot; 
<br />
<br />My point was never that murder is a basic instinct. These are all offshoots of basic instincts, the &quot;animal&quot; instincts, with the sole exception of selfishness, which is not an offshoot.
<br />
<br />So let's drop that point, shall we? Consider I'd assume we both agree on the...immorality of murder, bloodlust, misogyny, and selfishness.

<br />Yeah... I'm not quite clear what you mean by half-man, though.    <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />A human or group of humans that for its liminality is despised and used as an object--a scapegoat, if you will--for all our lower instincts to be projected upon, the bestial parts of ourselves, and those that we hate most. This all is in an attempt to deify ourselves by comparison, showing how God and humanity is on our side, not that of the thing less than human.

<br />Unfortunately, it was arrogance that mainly resulted in the Cold War.  The terror in the Cold War was not caused by the unknown per se (at least not in the way you portray it) but simply because people are much easier to control when they live in fear.  The Russians were portrayed as evil, freedom-hating imperialists.  And the Americans were portrayed as vile, capitalist slavers who gave all the wealth over to a few, priveliged (they might have been on to something <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) upper classes.  You were taught to fear the other side because it would rape your women and pillage your country, the fear was not rational but simply programmed in.

<br />
<br />It wasn't irrelevant at all. I just told you not to ask. And now I shall hum pointlessly another line of Phish:

<br /><i>A crystal haze, and with a sweet sound bouncing round...a neverending coral maze... </i>
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />Unfortunately, it was arrogance that mainly resulted in the Cold War <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Truly, I was not speaking about what resulted in the cold war, but the fact that it continued for the better part of half a century. Both sides were so convinced they were right, so arrogant, so wrapped up in their worldviews that they failed to step outside momentarily, to view their mindframes with objectivity, to see with the eyes of their enemies.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />Alright then, but then how do you define &quot;can't be&quot;? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Ok, let me explain myself better. Something that &quot;can't be&quot; understood, cannot be known is a thing that no matter which way it is looked at cannot be comprehended from within the mental frame. The stimulus cannot be categorized and interpreted within the mind, because it transcends such boundaries. To understand it, one's frame must become fluid, transmutable. Open mindedness of the highest degree.
<br />
<br />I'll give an example, a minor example:
<br />
<br />                   .    .    .
<br />                   .    .    .
<br />                   .    .    .
<br />
<br />Nine dots. Connect them all with four straight, connected lines. Make a diagram in paint, figure it out, and post it on here.
<br />
<br />You're right that anything can be explained. That is, however, irrelevant. Deja vu can be explained in entirely scientific terms, but that doesn't change the fact that without said explanation the mind cannot comprehend it. 
<br />Furthermore, explanation and comprehension are two entirely different things. One can <i>explain </i> the physical and biological evidence supporting homosexuality as a genetically-caused and entirely natural orientation; a homophobe will most likely not accept it as fact, even if the argument is unquestionably sound. He/she will object to their frame being twisted and broken, holding on instead to what they claimed to be truth, and therefore not comprehend the argument at all.
<br />
<br />Finallly, there are things in the universe that still we can't explain and can't comprehend. Quantum physics, for example. We have barely touched the tip of the  iceberg on that. 
<br />
<br />One of the most basic concepts, <i>time </i>, we do not understand. All we know of that is our memories of the &quot;past&quot;, sensation of the &quot;present&quot;, reasoning that there will be a &quot;future&quot;. Sensation and interpretation, no more. We don't know what it <i>is </i>.

<br />I know <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. I'll draw up a diagram showing you how. Give me a minute.
<br />
<br />Ok, here's the rest of the argument. Enjoy:

<br />I'll take the other examples, if you please.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Ok, here we go:
<br />Firstly, from direct experience: I meditate daily, so I have somewhat of a vast quantity of experiences with the terror/awe factor (disregard, momentarily at least, the fact that meditation is now being used in North America as the replacement for happy pills). The function of this practice is--at least, so my experience has been and so I have learned--not mere relaxation. It is rather a method of <i>plunging </i>, in Senecan terms, by way of alleviating the conscious thought. Ego transcendence. One's mind expands and opens. If acted out properly, the experience can be supremely blissful (in a way that ignorance could never fulfill <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>). Having said that, the sheer envelopment of the mind, the sudden alleviation of the frame, the dissolution of the accustomed conscious thought can be severely terrifying, simultaneously coupled with the happiness derived from it. There are times when I have simply opened my eyes, stood and stopped  because the total immersion is overwhelming and indeed on the verge of terror.
<br />
<br />As for the dream-ideas I presented to you, they are all somewhat like dreams that I have had. Dreams of this sort are common cross-culturally. Obviously, the specifics and details are not the same, but the same idea is there: A terror at the unknowable, dangerous forces. This theme shows up again and again--not only in dream, but also in myth (contemporary and ancient).
<br />
<br />Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. Ya and Jonah in the New Testament.  In the children's movie &quot;The Lion King&quot;, the hero covers his face in terror at hearing the thunderous voice and image of his dead father in the heavens. In the Lord of the Rings (books and movies), Pippin is strangely drawn to the mysterious Palantir...and when he gazes into its depths is overcome with terror at what he sees. In the Old Testament, Moses comes down from Mount Sinai and must wear a veil over his face because the Hebrews are terrified to look at him, shining with light (literally). Another recent thriller (I forget its name), shows a young vacationing couple who go scuba diving, and when they surface their tour boat has left, leaving them alone with nothing but endless miles of the black depth surrounding them...truly terrifying.
<br />
<br />Ok, so direct experience, ancient myth and modern popular culture...now onto rational argument:
<br />
<br />1. / Absolute reality must by necessity exist or by necessity not exist.
<br />2. / Only that which is a contradiction must by necessity not exist.
<br />3. / Absolute reality cannot be shown to be a contradiction, as that would imply nothing existed beyond the frame.
<br />4. / Transcending the mindframe, it cannot be interpreted and categorized.
<br />5. / Being unable to interpret, to comprehend it, one feels the dual instinct of wonder and terror--the former because it transcends the ego, the later because of its awesome power that cannot be understood.
<br />
<br />Ok, I'm bloody spent. Apologies for the hideous length of the post.
<br />
<br />Truly, it is hard to explain this in terms of words, for words are only sounds and sketches given meaning solely by one's frame. The Absolute transcends the frame. Words are insufficient to describe it.</div>

<br />The recent thriller was called Open Water.  Anyway, the terror in most of these examples (I don't know much about Krishna and Arjuna) is in the of a seemingly omnipotent and/or omniscient power.  While these instances are definitely shrouded in unknown they are also covered with an overbearing feel of strength, and knowledge that anything might happen if they displease this power.  If you were in the USA in the 1970s would you fear the Communists because you didn't know much about them, or because they had (it is alledged) thousands of thermonuclear weapons pointed at you?  I maintain that ignorance can never be a primary cause of irrational terror (notice I use terror, in it's most literal form).  It can and certainly is a primary cause of suspicion, which is then blown into fear and terror upon the reception of a second, relevant (sometimes irrelevant) stimulus.  Perhaps Simba covered his face not out of fear, but shame and guilt at the knowledge he caused his father's death.  Pippin as you said is overcome with fear at <i>what he sees.  </i>  Who wouldn't be terrified to look into the very essence of pure evil incarnate?  I don't know much about the bible, so I will avoid comment on both Jonah and Moses lest I grasp the wrong end of the proverbial stick.  As for Open Water, well, it was pretty clear they were going to die.  They had every justification for being terrified. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />You constantly refer to the Absolute (sic) as a proper noun.  What exactly do you mean by it, just to make sure we are on the same page.  Otherwise, up to point 4, I agree with you, points 4 and 5 are a little peculiar, though.
