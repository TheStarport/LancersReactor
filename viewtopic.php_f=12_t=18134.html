			<div class="content">Ok, instead of posting a new topic each time, I will now just post the funny stuff I find in this one.  Please feel free to add your funny stuff to it as well.
<br />
<br />Here it is:
<br />
<br />It may be that your whole purpose in life is to serve as a
<br />warning to others.
<br />
<br />I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who
<br />annoy me.
<br />
<br />At least you're not being rectally probed by aliens.
<br />
<br />What if, at this very moment, you are living up to your full
<br />potential?
<br />
<br />The more you think about things, the weirder they seem. Take
<br />this milk. Why do we drink *cow* milk?? Who was the guy who
<br />first looked at a cow and said, &quot;I think I'll drink whatever
<br />comes out of these things when I squeeze 'em.
<br />
<br />My favorite poem is the one that starts &quot;Thirty days have
<br />September&quot; because it actually tells you something.
<br />
<br />Eat a live toad first thing in the morning, and nothing worse
<br />can happen to you the rest of the day. 
<br />
<br />Hang in there, retirement is only thirty years away!
<br />
<br />Do not believe in miracles, rely on them.
<br />
<br />We all can't be heroes. Somebody has to sit on the sides and
<br />clap as they go by.
<br />
<br />I don't have a solution but I admire the problem.
<br />
<br />My ambition is to live forever - so far, so good!
<br />
<br />Don't follow in my footsteps, because I run into a lot of walls.
<br />
<br />Sanity calms, but madness is more interesting.
<br />
<br />Don't talk about yourself so much... we'll do that when you
<br />leave.
<br />
<br />If you try and don't succeed, cheat. Repeat until caught. Then
<br />lie.
<br />
<br />This morning I looked down at my unmade bed and decided that it
<br />was art in another medium and I should not destroy it.
<br />
<br />If you can't say anything nice...come sit by us.
<br />
<br />Know what I'm thinking? No. Neither do I; frightening, isn't it?
<br />
<br />If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style.
<br />
<br />Never say &quot;OOPS!&quot; always say &quot;Ah, Interesting!&quot;
<br />
<br />This isn't burger king, you can't have it your way.
<br />
<br />My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance.
<br />
<br />If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never
<br />tried before.

<br />Now me:
<br />How come yoy have to pay alimony only or one type of mistake?
<br />Thieves are among us, we are among them.
<br />He was a great guy! He relied on his strength.
<br />The last word of technology will be - HELP!
<br />&quot;A dog is a man's best friend&quot; is how people feel, not dogs
<br />It's easy to be the first when the second one is chasing you...
<br />Enough of morals! Let's hear the story first!
<br />There are more chickens among humans than among birds...
<br />What's a minus sign between you and me?
<br />When everything's on the line, you can't quite see the line, can you?
<br />His love nest is here, but he doesn't seem to lay any eggs...
<br />To err is human, not an obligation...
<br />Our debt consists of four letters and countless numbers.
<br />We know who's in charge, but we don't know who's responsible...
<br />And as we go trough life running around in circles, there are always those who are closer to the center than the others...
<br />The problem is in you -- we can tell by the size of your stomach...
<br />Unseen stupidities are the most eye-catching.
<br />Armed with knowledge, we are shooting blanks...
<br />A life has been extinguished. All credits go to the Fire Department.
<br />There are many ways to devide people, but there is only one way to multiply...

			<div class="content">nice one peeps.. i may have to steal some.. you don't mind right huff?
<br />me now..
<br />A taxi passenger tapped the driver on the shoulder to ask him a
<br />question. The driver screamed, lost control of the car, nearly hit
<br />a bus, went upon the footpath, and stopped centimeters from a shop
<br />window.
<br />
<br />For a second everything went quiet in the cab, then the driver
<br />said, &quot;Look mate, don't ever do that again. You scared the daylights
<br />out of me!&quot;
<br />
<br />The passenger apologized and said, &quot;I didn't realize that a little
<br />tap would scare you so much.&quot;
<br />
<br />The driver replied, &quot;Sorry, it's not really your fault. Today is my
<br />first day as a cab driver - I've been driving a van carrying dead
<br />bodies for the last 25 years.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Man coming home very tired after work his wife tells him that the
<br />shower is not working. Man replies &quot;I am not a plumber. Just call
<br />the plumber&quot;
<br />
<br />Next day
<br />Man coming home very tired Wife tells him that the cupboard door
<br />has broken and needs to be replaced. Man replies &quot;I am not a
<br />carpenter. Call the Carpenter&quot;
<br />
<br />Third day
<br />Man coming home very tired from work Wife says &quot;honey the work is
<br />done. The young boy from the neighbourhood came and did the work
<br />for me. He repaired the cupboard door and now the shower is also
<br />working. &quot;
<br />
<br />Man says &quot;Good ... did he charge anything?&quot;
<br />
<br />Wife replies &quot;No. He did it on one condition that I either sleep
<br />with him for one night OR Bake a nice cake for him&quot;
<br />
<br />Man says &quot;well did you bake the cake then?&quot;
<br />
<br />Women replies &quot;I am not a baker...................&quot;
<br />
<br />Good: Your hubby and you agree, no more kids
<br />Bad : You can't find your birth control pills
<br />Ugly: Your daughter borrowed them
<br />
<br />Good: Your husband understands fashion
<br />Bad : He's a cross-dresser
<br />Ugly: He looks better than you
<br />
<br />Good: Your son's finally maturing
<br />Bad : He's involved with the woman next door
<br />Ugly: So are you
<br />
<br />Good: Your wife's not talking to you
<br />Bad : She wants a divorce
<br />Ugly: She's a lawyer
<br />
<br />Good: The postman's early
<br />Bad : He's wearing fatigues and carrying an AK47
<br />Ugly: You gave him nothing for Christmas
<br />
<br />Good: You're son is dating someone new
<br />Bad : It's another man
<br />Ugly: He's you're best friend
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Science is knowledge.
<br />Knowledge is power.
<br />Time is money.
<br />power = work/time
<br />therefore, knowledge= work/money
<br />therefore, money = work/knowledge
<br />therefore, money is inversely proportional to knowledge.
<br />
<br />therefore,
<br />
<br />The <i>more </i> knowledge you have, the <i>less </i> money you have.
<br />
<br />Prepare for the worst, for you have read the worst.</div>

<br />
<br />How to Keep a Healthy Level of Insanity	
<br />
<br />1. At lunch time, sit in your parked car with
<br />sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing
<br />cars.  See if  they slow down.
<br />
<br />2. Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise
<br />your voice.
<br />
<br />3. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask
<br />if they want fries with that.
<br />
<br />4. Put your garbage can on your desk and label it
<br />&quot;in&quot;
<br />
<br />5. Put decaff in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once
<br />everyone has Gotten over their caffeine addictions,
<br />switch to espresso.
<br />
<br />6. In the memo field of all your checks, write &quot;for
<br />sexual favours.&quot;
<br />
<br />7. Finish all your sentences with &quot;in accordance
<br />with the prophecy.&quot;
<br />
<br />8. Don't use any punctuation marks
<br />
<br />9. As often as possible, skip rather than walk.
<br />
<br />10. Ask people what sex they are. Laugh hysterically
<br />after they answer.
<br />
<br />11. Specify that your drive-through order is &quot;to
<br />go.&quot;
<br />
<br />12. Sing along at the opera.
<br />
<br />13. Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems
<br />don't rhyme.
<br />
<br />14. Put mosquito netting around your work area. Play
<br />a tape of jungle sounds all day.
<br />
<br />15. Five days in advance, tell your friends you
<br />can't attend their party because you're not in the
<br />mood.
<br />
<br />16. Have your coworkers address you by your
<br />wrestling name, Rock Hard Kim.
<br />
<br />17. When the money comes out the ATM, scream &quot;I
<br />won!&quot;, &quot;I won!&quot; &quot;3rd time this week!!!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />18. When leaving the zoo, start running towards the
<br />parking lot, yelling &quot;run for your lives, they're
<br />loose!!&quot;
<br />
<br />19. Tell your children over dinner. &quot;due to the
<br />economy, we are going to have to let one of you go.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />And the final way to keep a healthy level of
<br />insanity.......
<br />
<br />20. Send this e-mail to everyone in your address
<br />book, even if they sent it to you or asked you not
<br />to send them stuff like this.</div>

			<div class="content">Friendly fire - isn't.
<br />
<br />Recoilless rifles - aren't.
<br />
<br />Suppressive fires - won't.
<br />
<br />You are not Superman; Marines and fighter pilots take note.
<br />
<br />A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down.
<br />
<br />If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.
<br />
<br />Try to look unimportant; the enemy may be low on ammo and not want to waste a bullet on you.
<br />
<br />If at first you don't succeed, call in an airstrike.
<br />
<br />If you are forward of your position, your artillery will fall short.
<br />
<br />Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself.
<br />
<br />Never go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself.
<br />
<br />Never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder.
<br />
<br />If your attack is going really well, it's an ambush.
<br />
<br />The enemy diversion you're ignoring is their main attack.
<br />
<br />The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions: when they're ready. &amp; when you're not. 
<br />
<br />No battleplan ever survives initial contact.
<br />
<br />There is no such thing as a perfect plan.
<br />
<br />Five second fuzes always burn three seconds.
<br />
<br />There is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole. This is not an argument against atheists.. It is an argument against foxholes.
<br />
<br />A retreating enemy is probably just falling back and regrouping.
<br />
<br />The important things are always simple; the simple are always hard.
<br />
<br />The easy way is always mined.
<br />
<br />Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy other people to shoot at.
<br />
<br />Don't look conspicuous; it draws fire. 
<br />
<br />Never draw fire; it irritates everyone around you.
<br />
<br />Incoming fire has the right of way.
<br />
<br />No combat ready unit has ever passed inspection.
<br />
<br />No inspection ready unit has ever passed combat.
<br />
<br />If the enemy is within range, so are you.
<br />
<br />The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire.
<br />
<br />Make it too tough for the enemy to get in, and you won't be able to get out.
<br />
<br />Tracers work both ways.
<br />
<br />If you take more than your fair share of objectives, you will get more than your fair share of objectives to take. 
<br />
<br />When both sides are convinced they're about to lose, they're both right.
<br />
<br />Professional soldiers are predictable; the world is full of dangerous amateurs.
<br />
<br />Military Intelligence is a contradiction.
<br />
<br />If you can't remember, the Claymore is pointed towards you.
<br />
<br />Mines are equal opportunity weapons.
<br />
<br />Sniper's motto: reach out and touch someone.
<br />
<br />Killing for peace is like screwing for virginity.
<br />
<br />It's not the one with your name on it; it's the one addressed &quot;to whom it may concern&quot; you've got to think about.
<br />
<br />If you can keep your head while those around you are losing theirs, you may have misjudged the situation.
<br />
<br />Anything you do can get you shot, including doing nothing.
<br />
<br />Whenever you lose contact with the enemy, look behind you.
<br />
<br />The most dangerous thing in the combat zone is an officer with a map.
<br />
<br />If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.
<br />
<br />There is nothing more satisfying than having someone take a shot at you, and miss.
<br />
<br />Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
<br />
<br />So he said, &quot;Cheer up: it could be worse!&quot; So we cheered up. And it got worse.
<br />
<br />The side with the simplest uniform wins...
<br />
<br />How come you are on one frequency when everyone else is on another?</div>

			<div class="content">Top 8 Idiots of 2000 
<br />
<br />Idiot # 1
<br />I am a medical student currently doing a rotation in toxicology
<br />at the poison control center. Today, this woman called in very
<br />upset because she caught her little daughter eating ants. I
<br />quickly reassured her that the ants are not harmful and there
<br />would be no need to bring her daughter into the hospital. She
<br />calmed down, and at the end of the conversation happened to
<br />mention that she gave her daughter some ant poison to eat in
<br />order to kill the ants. I told her that she better bring her
<br />daughter into the Emergency room right away.
<br />
<br />Here's your sign lady. Wear it with pride.
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 2
<br />Seems that a year ago, some Boeing employees on the airfield
<br />decided to steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were
<br />successful in getting it out of the plane and home. When they
<br />took it for a float on the river, a Coast Guard helicopter
<br />coming towards them surprised them. It turned out that the
<br />chopper was homing in on the emergency locator beacon which
<br />activated when the raft was inflated.
<br />
<br />They are no longer employed at Boeing.
<br />
<br />Here's your sign guys. Don't get it wet, the paint might run.
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 3
<br />A true story out of San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a
<br />downtown Bank of America, walked into the branch and wrote &quot;this
<br />iz a stikkup. Put all your muny in this bag.&quot; While standing in
<br />line, waiting to give his note to the teller, he began to worry
<br />that someone had seen him write the note and might call the
<br />police before he reached the teller window. So he left the Bank
<br />of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo.
<br />
<br />After waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the
<br />Wells Fargo teller. He read it and, surmising from his spelling
<br />errors that he wasn't the brightest light in the harbor, told
<br />him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was
<br />written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would
<br />either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to
<br />Bank of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man said &quot;OK&quot;
<br />and left.
<br />
<br />He was arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line
<br />back at Bank of America.
<br />
<br />Don't bother with this guy's sign. He probably could read it
<br />anyway.
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 4
<br />
<br />A motorist was unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap
<br />that measured his speed using radar and photographed his car. He
<br />later received in the mail a ticket for $40 and a photo of his
<br />car. Instead of payment, he sent the police department a
<br />photograph of $40. Several days later, he received a letter from
<br />the police that contained another picture, this time of
<br />handcuffs. He immediately mailed in his $40.
<br />
<br />Another sign (though this guy might be onto something worth
<br />thinking about)!
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 5
<br />Guy walked into a little corner store with a shotgun and
<br />demanded all the cash from the cash drawer. After the cashier
<br />put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a bottle of scotch that he
<br />wanted behind the counter on the shelf. He told the cashier to
<br />put it in the bag as well, but he refused and said, &quot;Because I
<br />don't believe you are over 21.&quot;
<br />
<br />The robber said he was, but the clerk still refused to give it
<br />to him because he didn't believe him. At this point the robber
<br />took his driver's license out of his wallet and gave it to the
<br />clerk. The clerk looked it over, and agreed that the man was in
<br />fact over 21 and he put the scotch in the bag. The robber then
<br />ran from the store with his loot. The cashier promptly called
<br />the police and gave the name and address of the robber that he
<br />got off the license.
<br />
<br />They arrested the robber two hours later.
<br />
<br />(Remind me to have more signs printed up. Give this guy his!)
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 6
<br />A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop nervously
<br />waving revolvers. The first one shouted, &quot;Nobody move!&quot;
<br />
<br />When his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him.
<br />
<br />(This guy doesn't need a sign, he probably figured it out
<br />himself.)
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 7
<br />Arkansas: Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He
<br />decided that he'd just throw a cinder block through a liquor
<br />store window, grab some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder
<br />block and heaved it over his head at the window.
<br />
<br />The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the
<br />head, knocking him unconscious. Seems the liquor store window
<br />was made of Plexi-Glass. The whole event was caught on videotape.
<br />
<br />(Oh, that smarts. Give him his sign!)
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Idiot # 8
<br />Ann Arbor: The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man
<br />walked into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 12:50 am
<br />flashed a gun and demanded cash.
<br />
<br />The clerk turned him down because he said the couldn't open the
<br />cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion
<br />rings, the clerk said they weren't available for breakfast. The
<br />man, frustrated, walked away.
<br />

<br />US Naval Communications 
<br />
<br />This is the transcript of an ACTUAL radio conversation of a US
<br />naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of
<br />Newfoundland in October, 1995. 
<br />
<br />Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to
<br />avoid a collision.
<br />
<br />Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the
<br />South to avoid a collision.
<br />
<br />Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again,
<br />divert YOUR course.
<br />
<br />Canadians: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.
<br />
<br />Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND
<br />LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE
<br />ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS
<br />SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES
<br />NORTH, THAT'S ONE FIVE DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL
<br />BE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.
<br />
<br />Canadians: We are a lighthouse. Your call.

<br />Highway Patrol Ball 
<br />
<br />A California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer pulls over a
<br />woman for speeding. When he walked up to her window and opened
<br />his ticket book she said, &quot;I bet you're going to sell me tickets
<br />to the Highway Patrol Ball.&quot; 
<br />
<br />He replied, &quot;No, highway patrolmen don't have balls.&quot; There
<br />followed a moment of silence while she smiled and he realized
<br />what he had said. He then closed his book, got back on his
<br />motorcycle and left.</div>

<br />OK, my turn again... <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />### POLITICAL JOKES WARNING ###
<br />Since we all love George Bush so much, I made a compilation in his honor...
<br />Don't delete them; it's soooo hard to fill Z's shoes... 
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />UN: Do you have any kind of proof that the Iraqi have chemical/biological warfare weapons?
<br />Bush: Sure we do... I kept all of the original orders and receipts...
<br />
<br />Before the elections, Bush decided to check his status... So he went to the statistician and saidI want you to do a survey to determine the number of my supporters. Oh, and I think that the results will show that 98% of the voters are going to vote for me.&quot;
<br />When he returned the next week, and asked about the results, the statistician said: &quot;It seems that all of the 50.000 people that we interviewed were inside those 2% against you...&quot;
<br />
<br />The night after Bush lost at the elections, the Devil appeared in front of his bed, and said: &quot;I've got an offer for you. Hear me out, then decide what's to be done.&quot;
<br />Bush: &quot;I'm listening...&quot;
<br />Devil: &quot;I'm offering you the possibility to be the president of the USA for the rest of your life. You will have complete unlimited power. Everyone and everything shall obey you and love you and praise you as though you were their closest family. In return, after you die, I'll take your soul, and the soul of your wife, and your kids, your relatives, friends and party members, along with the souls of all of your supporters. So what do you say?&quot;
<br />Bush, after a few seconds: &quot;OK, so what's the catch?&quot;
<br />
<br />One day, after he purchased a brand new Mercedes, Bush decided to take a ride to see how it goes... At first he was driving 50, but that got boring very soon... Then he goes for 100, then 150... Finally, after a helicopter chase, the cops manage to persuade him to stop. As the policeman approached, Bush opened the window and asked &quot;OK, what is it now?&quot;. The policeman, seeing that he made a &quot;mistake&quot;, decides to let him go... Then he radioes his collegue not to pull the black Mercedes over. When asked why, he replied &quot;I'm not sure who's inside, but Bush did the driving...&quot;
<br />
<br />After he crashed his new Mercedes, Bush's life was saved thanks to a young man who happened to be near the crash site... After he recovered, Bush asked the young man what would he like as a token of appretiation. &quot;I'd like a wheelchair, Mr. President...&quot; &quot;Why do you ask for a wheelchair?&quot; &quot;Because, when my daddy finds out that I was the one who rescued you, he's gonna break both my legs!&quot;
<br />
<br />George Bush (finally) died, and (of course) gone straight to Hell. But the Devil was compassionate to his associate, so he let Bush choose the torturing method...
<br />The first room had souls nailed to the wall, and whipped by demons.
<br />'I don't like this one, let's move on', said Bush. So they come to the second room. In this room there was this giant swimming pool full of sh*t, in which the souls were eternally drowning. 'I don't like this one either... let's see what else is there.'
<br />Finally they enter the third room. Inside the room there was Bill Clinton sitting in the chair, and Monica Lewinsky doing what she does best... 'I like this one... I'll take it.', said Bush. 'OK, Monica, you can go now!', the Devil replied...

<br />When you go to Heaven: 
<br />
<br />You are greeted by the British, the French do the cooking, the Italians do the entertaining and the Germans run everything. 
<br />
<br />When you go to Hell: 
<br />
<br />You are greeted by the French, the British do the cooking, the Germans do the entertaining and the Italians run everything. 
<br />=======================================================
<br />There are three construction workers (one Italian, one Jewish and one Polish) sitting on the 21st floor of a building being erected. They sit down for lunch. The Italian opens his lunch and he has pasta. He says, &quot;If I have pasta one more time, I'm going to jump off this building.&quot; The Jew opens his lunch pail and has chopped liver. He says, &quot;If I have chopped liver one more time, it's over for me, too. The Pole opens his lunch and has peanut butter and jelly. He says the same thing. 
<br />
<br />The next day, the Italian opens his box and it's pasta. He jumps 21 floors - splat - dead. Same for the Jew - chopped liver - splat - dead. Likewise for the Pole - peanut butter and jelly - splat - dead. 
<br />
<br />At the funeral, the wives are commiserating. The Italian wife says, &quot;If only my husband had told me, I would have packed him something else besides pasta. The Jewish wife agrees, &quot;Me too, I would certainly have packed something besides chopped liver, I want my husband alive.&quot; The Polish wife says, &quot;I just don't understand, my husband makes his own lunch.&quot;

<br />How many Californians does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
<br />
<br />a) Six. One to turn the bulb, one for support, and four to relate to the experience. 
<br />b) Californians don't screw in light bulbs; they screw in hot tubs.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />How many Oregonians does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
<br />
<br />a) Five. One to change the bulb and four more to chase off the Californians who have come up to relate to the experience. 
<br />b) Nine. One to change the bulb, and eight to protest the nuclear power plant that generates the electricity that powers it.
<br />
<br />How many Marxists does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
<br />
<br />None. The light bulb contains the seeds of its own revolution. 
<br />
<br />
<br />How many Russian leaders does it take to change a light bulb? 
<br />
<br />Nobody knows. Russian leaders don't last as long as light bulbs.

<br />Three reasons why the British are better than the Americans:
<br />
<br />-They speak English. 
<br />-When they host a world championship, they invite other countries. 
<br />-Visitors to the head of state are only expected to go down on one knee. 
<br />=======================================================
<br />Canada draws against the US in this match-up. Here's how:
<br />US attacks...
<br />An American and his wife were driving in Canada and got lost. Finally, they arrived at some city. They saw a gentleman on the sidewalk, so they stopped. The wife let down her window and asked, &quot;Excuse me, sir. Where are we?&quot; 
<br />
<br />The gentleman replied, &quot;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The wife rolled up the window, turned to her husband and said, &quot;We really are lost. They don't even speak English here!&quot; 
<br />
<br />Canadian counter-attack...
<br />Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six days. Eventually,Michael the archangel found him, resting on the seventh day. He inquired of God, &quot;Where have you been?&quot; God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downwards through the clouds, &quot;Look Michael, look what I've made.&quot; Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;It's a planet,&quot; replied God, &quot;and I've put life on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.&quot; &quot;Balance?&quot; inquired Michael, still confused. God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth, &quot;For example, Northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while Southern Europe is going to be poor. The Middle East over there will be a hot spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people,&quot; 
<br />
<br />God continued, pointing to different countries. &quot;This one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to a large land mass in the top corner and asked, &quot;What's that one?&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; said God. &quot;That's Canada, the most glorious place on Earth. There are beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, streams and an exquisite coastline. The people from Canada are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found traveling the  world. They'll be extremely sociable, hardworking and high achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed; &quot;What about balance, God? You said there would be balance!&quot; God replied wisely. &quot;Wait until you see the loud-mouth bastards I'm putting next to them ...&quot; 
<br />
<br />It's a 1:1 as you can see...
<br />=======================================================
<br />Driving rules for Americans:
<br />
<br />Turn signals will give away your next move. Don't bother using them or noticing when someone else does. A little respect goes a long way and we wouldn't want that taking the extreme aggressiveness off of our roads! 
<br />
<br />Drive three inches behind the car in front of you even if you are in the far right lane ... they don't want to see your headlights anyways so you will be doing them a courtesy. It's not like this ever causes accidents or anything. 
<br />
<br />Crossing two or more lanes in a single lane-change is considered going with the flow and should be done often. Also refer back to Rule #1.  
<br />
<br />Lights: Yellow light means &quot;Floor it!&quot; If the light just turned red it is okay to go through it, still. The faster you drive through the red light, the smaller the chance you have of getting hit. If you end up behind somebody who slows down for a yellow light, get very angry and honk your horn at him while swearing. Always honk your horn at cars that don't move the instant the light changes. Always assume a green light is going to turn red just before you get to it; speed up when approaching an intersection.  
<br />
<br />Never, ever, come to a complete stop at a stop sign. No one expects it and it will inevitably result in you being rear ended. If you want to annoy the guy off behind you and have your insurance company pay for a new rear bumper, come to a complete stop at all stop signs. 
<br />
<br />A lane construction closure is just a game to see how many people can cut in line by passing you in the soon-to-be-closed lane as you responsibly sit in the proper lane waiting for the same ****s to squeeze their way back in before hitting the orange construction barrels. Don't attempt to stop your car on the line so these creeps can't pass you; it only makes them honk their horn and give you dirty looks as they drive on the closed part of the road to get around you. 
<br />
<br />Never get in the way of a car that needs extensive bodywork (That's one out of every 20 here.) They have obviously been in many accidents and probably are under- insured if at all. 
<br />
<br />Braking is to be done as hard and late as possible to ensure that your ABS kicks in, giving a nice, relaxing foot massage as the brake pedal pulsates. This is to be done especially fast right after changing lanes and cutting someone off. 
<br />
<br />Never pass on the left when you can pass on the right. It's a great way to scare people entering the highway. 
<br />
<br />Speed limits are arbitrary figures, given only as suggestions and are apparently not enforcable. If it says 55 MPH, you should be doing at least 70. Anyone doing less than that will be tailgated, harrassed, and passed on all sides. 
<br />
<br />Just because you're in the left lane and have no room to speed up or move over doesn't mean that a driver, flashing his high beams behind you, doesn't think he can go faster in your spot. 
<br />
<br />Need a shortcut when traffic is high? Simply drive down the center lane. It's completely safe and no cop will ever give you a hard time about it. On the freeway? Just take the carpool lane or the space to the left or right of the &quot;real&quot; lanes. 
<br />
<br />Always slow down and rubberneck when you see an accident or even someone changing a tire. 
<br />
<br />Learn to swerve abruptly. Most truckers don't have any idea how to load their trucks so be prepared to dodge pallets, boxes, and even couches! Abrubt swerving is also a fun and safe way to change lanes quickly and instantly! (Once again, refer to Rule #1.) 
<br />
<br />Remember that the goal of every driver is to get there first, by whatever means necessary. 
<br />
<br />Real women American drivers can put on pantyhose, apply eye makeup, yell at their kids, and run you off of the road in their SUV's, at seventy-five miles per hour in bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
<br />
<br />Flipping someone the bird is considered a special salute. This gesture should always be returned. 
<br />
<br />Once you get onto the freeway, just get into the far left lane and stay there. When other drivers pull up behind you trying to pass just ignore them and wait. Soon you will see that you have forced them to dart in and out of traffic to get around you which is much safer for everyone than for you to pull to the right when you have a chance.

<br />The Travel Advisory for France
<br />
<br />The following advisory for American travelers heading for France was compiled from information provided by the U.S. State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Disease Control and some very expensive spy satellites that the French don't know about. It is intended as a guide for American travelers only and no guarantee of accuracy is ensured or intended. 
<br />
<br />General Overview
<br />France is a medium-sized foreign country situated on the continent of Europe, and is for all intents and purposes, completely useless. It is an important member of the world community, although not nearly as important as it thinks. It is bounded by Germany, Spain, Switzerland and some smaller nations of no particular consequence or shopping opportunities. 
<br />
<br />France is a very old country with many treasures such as the Louvre and EuroDisney. Among its contributions to Western civilization are champagne, Camembert cheese, the guillotine, and body odor. Although France likes to think of itself as a modern nation, air conditioning is little used. It is also next to impossible to get decent Mexican food. One continuing exasperation for American visitors is that the people willfully persist in speaking French, although many will speak English, if shouted at repeatedly. 
<br />
<br />The People
<br />France has a population of 54 million people, most of whom drink and smoke a great deal, drive like lunatics, are dangerously oversexed and have no concept of standing patiently in a line. The French people are generally gloomy, temperamental, proud, arrogant, aloof and undisciplined. Those are their good points. 
<br />
<br />Most French citizens are Roman Catholic, although you'd hardly guess it from their behavior. Many people are Communists and topless sunbathing is common. Men sometimes have girls' names like Marie and they kiss each other when they hand out medals. All French women have little tits and don't shave their armpits. 
<br />
<br />American travelers are advised to travel in groups and to wear baseball caps and colorful pants for easier mutual recognition. 
<br />
<br />Safety
<br />In general, France is a safe destination, although travelers are advised that France is occasionally invaded by Germany. By tradition, the French surrender more or less at once and, apart from a temporary shortage of Scotch whisky and increased difficulty in getting baseball scores and stock market prices, life for the visitors generally goes on much as before. A tunnel connection France to Britain beneath the English Channel has been opened in recent years to make it easier for the French government to flee to London. 
<br />
<br />History
<br />France was discovered by Charlemagne in the Dark Ages. Other important historical figures are Louis XIV, the Huguenots, Joan of Arc, Jacques Cousteau and Charles de Gaulle, who was President for many years and is now an airport. The French armies of the past have had their asses kicked by just about every other country in the world. 
<br />Government
<br />The French form of government is democratic but noisy. Elections are held more or less continuously and always result in a run-off. For administrative purposes, the country is divided into regions, departments, districts, municipalities, cantons, communes, villages, cafes, booths and floor tiles. 
<br />Parliament consists of two chambers, the Upper and Lower (although, confusingly, they are both on the ground floor). Members are either Gaullists or communists, neither of whom can be trusted. Parliament's principal preoccupations are setting off atomic bombs in the South Pacific and acting indignant when anyone complains. According to the most current State Department intelligence, the current President is someone named Jacques. Further information is not available at this time. 
<br />
<br />Culture
<br />The French pride themselves on their culture, although it is not easy to see why. All of their songs sound the same and they have hardly ever made a movie that you want to watch for anything except the nude scenes. Nothing, of course, is more boring than a French novel (except perhaps an evening with a French family.) 
<br />Cuisine
<br />Let's face it, no matter how much garlic you put on it, a snail is just a slug with a shell on its back. Croissants, on the other hand, are excellent, although it is impossible for most Americans to pronounce this word. American travelers are therefore advised to stick to cheeseburgers at McDonald's or the restaurants at the leading hotels, such as Sheraton or Holiday Inn. Bring your own beer, as the domestic varieties are nothing but a poor excuse for such. 
<br />Economy
<br />France has a large and diversified economy, second only to Germany's economy in Europe, which is surprising since people hardly ever work at all. If they are not spending four hours dawdling over lunch, they are on strike and blocking the roads with their trucks and tractors. France's principal exports, in order of importance to the economy, are wine, nuclear weapons, perfume, guided missiles, champagne, high-caliber weaponry, grenade launchers, land mines, tanks, attack aircraft, miscellaneous armaments and cheese. 
<br />Conclusion
<br />France enjoys a rich history, a picturesque and varied landscape and a temperate climate. In short, it would be a very nice country if French people didn't inhabit it, and it weren't still radioactive from all the nuclear tests they run. The best thing that can be said for it is that it is not Germany. Remember that no one ordered you to go abroad. Personally we always take our vacation in Miami Beach and you are advised to do the same. Thank you and good luck. 
<br />
<br />NOTE: This IS a joke. Really.

<br />An Irishman's Philosophy
<br />
<br />There are only two things to worry about. 
<br />
<br />Either you are well or you are sick. 
<br />
<br />If you are well, 
<br />then there's nothing to worry about. 
<br />
<br />But if you are sick, 
<br />there are only two things to worry about. 
<br />
<br />Either you will get well or you will die. 
<br />
<br />If you get well, 
<br />then there's nothing to worry about. 
<br />
<br />If you die, 
<br />there are only two things to worry about. 
<br />
<br />Either you will go to heaven or hell. 
<br />
<br />If you go to heaven, 
<br />there is nothing to worry about. 
<br />
<br />But if you go to hell, 
<br />you'll be so busy shaking hands with friends, 
<br />you won't have time to worry.

<br />The phone rings at KGB headquarters.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Hello?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;My neighbor Yankel Rabinovitz is an enemy of the State. He is hiding undeclared diamonds in his woodshed.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;This will be noted.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The next day, the KGB goons go over to Rabinovitz's house. They search the shed where the firewood is kept, break every piece of wood, find no diamonds, swear at Rabinovitz, and leave. 
<br />
<br />The phone rings at Rabinovitz's house.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Hello, Yankel! Did the KGB come?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Did they chop your firewood?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, they did.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay, now it's your turn to call. I need my vegetable patch plowed.&quot; 
<br />=======================================================
<br />A WWII American soldier had been on the front lines in Europe for three months when he was finally given a week of R&amp;R. He caught a boat to a supply base in the south of England, then took a train to London. The train was extremely crowded and he could not locate a seat. 
<br />
<br />He was dead on his feet and walked the length of the train looking for a place to sit down. Finally, he found a compartment with seats facing each other. There was room for two people on each seat. On one side sat only an older proper-looking British lady, with a small dog sitting in the seat beside her. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Could I please sit in that seat,&quot; he asked. 
<br />
<br />The woman insulted him, saying, &quot;You Americans are so rude. Can't you see my dog is sitting there?&quot; 
<br />
<br />The exhausted man walked through the train again and still could not find a seat. He found himself back at the same place. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Lady, I love dogs. I even have a couple at home. I would be glad to hold your dog if I can just sit down.&quot; The snooty woman replied, &quot;You Americans are not only rude, but you are also arrogant!&quot; 
<br />
<br />He leaned against the wall for a time, utterly exhausted and finally said, &quot;Lady, I've been on the front lines in Europe for three months with not a decent rest for all that time. Could I just please sit there and hold your dog?&quot; 
<br />
<br />The lady replied, &quot;You Americans are not only rude and arrogant but you are also obnoxious.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Hearing her comment, the soldier calmly stepped forward, picked up the dog, threw it out the window. Then he sat down where the dog had been sitting. The lady was awestruck and speechless. 
<br />
<br />Across the isle, an older neatly dressed Englishman spoke up. &quot;Young man, I do not know if all Americans fit the lady's description of you, but I do know that you Americans do a lot of things wrong. You drive on the wrong side of the road, you hold your fork with the wrong hand, and now you have just thrown the wrong bitch out of the window!&quot;
<br />=======================================================
<br />A Briton, a Frenchman and a Russian are viewing a painting of Adam and Eve, frolicking in the Garden of Eden. 
<br />&quot;Look at their reserve, their calm,&quot; muses the Brit. &quot;They must be British.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Nonsense,&quot; the Frenchman disagrees. &quot;They're naked and so beautiful. Clearly, they are French.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;No clothes, no shelter,&quot; the Russian points out. &quot;They have only an apple to eat and they're being told this is paradise. They are Russian.&quot;
<br />=======================================================
<br />New Rules for the English Language 
<br />(Euroenglish)
<br />The European Commission has just announced an agreement that English will be the official language of the European Community(EU) -- rather than German (the other possibility). 
<br />As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement, and has accepted a 5-year phase-in of new rules that would apply to the language and reclassify it as EuroEnglish. The agreed plan is as follows:
<br />
<br />In year 1, the soft 'c' would be replaced by 's'. Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard 'c' will be replased by 'k'. This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan now have one less letter. 
<br />
<br />There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome 'ph' is replased by 'f'. This will reduse &quot;fotograf' by 20%. 
<br />
<br />In the 3rd year, publik akseptance of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent 'e's in the language is disgrasful, and they should eliminat them. 
<br />
<br />By year 4, peopl wil be reseptiv to lingwistik korektions such as replasing 'th' with 'z' and 'w' with 'v' (saving mor keyboard spas). 
<br />
<br />During ze fifz year, ze unesesary 'o' kan be dropd from vords kontaining 'ou' and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters. After zis fifz year, ve vil hav a reli sensibil riten styl. Zer vil be no mor trubls or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. 
<br />
<br />ZE DREM VIL FINALI KUM TRU!!! 
<br />=========================================================
<br />A journalist had done a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War, and she noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands. She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives. 
<br />She approached one of the women for an explanation. 
<br />
<br />&quot;This is marvelous,&quot; said the journalist. &quot;What enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?&quot; 
<br />
<br />The Kuwaiti woman replied, &quot;Land mines.&quot; 
<br />=========================================================
<br />A Russian man has saved his rubles for twenty years to buy a new car. After choosing the model and options he wants, he's not the least bit surprised or even concerned to learn that it will take two years for the new car to be delivered. He thanks the salesman and starts to leave, but as he reaches the door he pauses and turns back to the salesman. &quot;Do you know which week, two years from now, the new car will arrive?&quot;, he asks. 
<br />The salesman checks his notes and tells the man that it will be two years to the exact week. The man thanks the salesman and starts out again, but upon reaching the door, he turns back again. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Could you possibly tell me what day of the week, two years from now, the car will arrive?&quot; The salesman, mildly annoyed, checks his notes again and says that it will be exactly two years from this week, on Thursday. The man thanks the salesman and once again starts to leave. 
<br />
<br />Halfway though the door, he hesitates, turns back and walks up to the salesman. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry to be so much trouble, but do you know if that will be two years from now on Thursday, in the morning or in the afternoon?&quot; Visibly irritated, the salesman flips through his papers yet another time and says sharply, that it will be in the afternoon, two years from now, on Thursday. 
<br />
<br />&quot;That's a relief!&quot;, says the man. &quot;The plumber is coming in the morning!&quot; 
<br />=========================================================
<br />OK, that's enough for now. I'm probably blacklisted by now anyway...

			<div class="content">Top 12 Homicides	
<br />
<br />Every year the FBI, is asked to investigate over 36,000 serious
<br />crimes including Murder/Homicides. Every year the Homicide
<br />Investigations Unit puts out its &quot;Top 12 Homicides of the Year&quot;.
<br />
<br />1. Alex Mijtus, 36 years old, is killed by his wife, armed with
<br />a 20&quot; long vibrator. Mrs Mijtus had had enough of her husbands
<br />strange sex practices and one night during a prolonged session
<br />of &quot;fun&quot; she snapped, pushing all 20&quot; of the vibrator into
<br />Alex's anus until it ruptured several internal organs and caused
<br />severe bleeding.
<br />
<br />2. Debby Mills-Newbroughton, 99 years old, was killed as she
<br />crossed the road. She was to turn 100 the next day, but crossing
<br />the road with her daughter to go to her own birthday party her
<br />wheel chair was hit by the truck delivering her birthday cake.
<br />
<br />3. Peter Stone, 42 years old, is murdered by his 8 year old
<br />daughter, who he had just sent to her room with no dinner. Young
<br />Samantha Stone felt that if she couldn't have dinner no one
<br />should, and she promptly inserted 72 rat poison tablets into her
<br />fathers coffee as he prepared dinner. The victim took one sip
<br />and promptly collapsed. Samantha Stone was given a suspended
<br />sentence as the judge felt she didn't realize what she was
<br />doing, until she tried to poison her mother using the same
<br />method one month later.
<br />
<br />4. David Danil, 17 years old, was killed by his girl friend
<br />after he attempted to &quot;have his way with her&quot; his unwelcome
<br />advance was met with a double barreled shotgun. Charla's (the
<br />girlfriend) father had given it to her an hour before the date
<br />started, just in case.
<br />
<br />5. Javier Halos, 27 years old, was killed by his landlord for
<br />failing to pay his rent for 8 years. The Land lord Kirk Weston
<br />clubbed the victim to death with a toilet seat after he realized
<br />just how long it had been since Mr Halos paid his rent.
<br />
<br />6. Megan Fry, 44 years old, is killed by 14 state troopers after
<br />she wandered onto a live firing, fake town simulation. Seeing
<br />all the troopers walking slow down the street Megan Fry has
<br />jumped out in front of them and yelled. &quot;Boo!&quot; The troopers,
<br />thinking she was a pop up target fired 67 shots between them,
<br />over 40 of them hitting target. &quot;She just looked like a very
<br />real looking target.&quot; One of the troopers stated in his report.
<br />
<br />7. Julia Smeeth, 20 years old, was killed by her brother Michael
<br />because she talked on the phone too long, Michael clubbed his
<br />sister to death with a cordless phone, then stabbed her several
<br />times with the broken arial.
<br />
<br />8. Helena Simms, Wife to the famous American Nuclear Scientist
<br />Harold Simms was killed by her husband after she had an affair
<br />with the neighbor. Over a period of 3 months Harold substituted
<br />Helena's eye shadow with a Uranium composite that was highly
<br />radioactive, until she died of radiation poisoning. Although she
<br />suffered many symptoms,including total hair loss, skin welts,
<br />blindness, extreme nausea and even had an ear lobe drop off the
<br />victim never attended a doctors surgery or hospital for a
<br />check-up.
<br />
<br />9. Military Sergeant John Joe Winter killed his &quot;two timing
<br />wife&quot; by loading her car with Trintynitrate explosive (similar
<br />to C4) the Ford Taurus she was driving was filled with 750 kgs
<br />of explosive, forming a force twice as powerful as the Oklahoma
<br />Bombing. The explosion was witnessed by several persons some up
<br />to 14 kilometers away. No trace of the car or the victim were
<br />ever found. Only a 55 meter deep crater, and 500m of missing
<br />road.
<br />
<br />10. Patty Winter, 35 years old, was killed by her neighbor in
<br />the early hours of a Sunday morning. Her neighbor, Falt Hame,
<br />for years had a mounted F6 phantom jet engine in his rear yard.
<br />He would fire the jet engine, aimed at a empty block at the back
<br />of his property. Patty Winter would constantly complain to the
<br />local sheriff's officers about the noise and the potential risk
<br />of fire. Mr Hame was served with a notice to remove the engine
<br />immediately. Not liking this he invited Miss Winter over &quot;for a
<br />cup of coffee and a chat&quot; about the whole situation. What Winter
<br />didn't know was that he had changed the position of the engine,
<br />as she walked into the yard he activated it, hitting her with a
<br />blast of 5000 degrees, killing her instantly, and forever
<br />burning her outline into the driveway.
<br />
<br />12. Conrad Middleton, 26 years old, was killed by his twin
<br />brother Brian after a disagreement over who should take the
<br />family home after their parents' passed away. Conrad had a nasal
<br />problem, and had no sense of smell. After the argument Brian
<br />stormed out of the house, then snuck back later, and turned on
<br />the 3 gas taps in the house, filling it with gas. Then left out
<br />a box of cigars, a lighter and a note saying, &quot;Sorry for the
<br />spree, have a puff on me, Brian&quot; Conrad promptly lit a cigar,
<br />destroying the house, and himself in the process.</div>
