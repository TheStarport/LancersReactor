			<div class="content">These past few weeks, I've been busy with revision for my exams. Out of my 8 modules in which I'm writing exams, there are two that are a bit troublesome. 
<br />To explain things a bit, I'm doing a BSc degree with my majors being Computer science and information systems. 
<br />Then I'm not doing it at a normal Uni, but through the post...distance learning I think they call it.
<br />This two subjects lead to two thoughts I had.
<br />The uni has a webset, where you can hand in assignments and do a lot of stuff, including posting on forums. Reading this forums, I found that in both these subjects a lot of people had the same problem, namely the textbook.
<br />
<br />In both cases students complain that the textbook is unanderstandable and of little to no help, unless you want to be confused that is.
<br />The first subject, is <i>Theoretical computer science </i> 
<br />Not that it has anything to do with computers mind you, the name of the text book is <i> A usr-friendly(pah!) introduction to Discrete mathematics for computer science </i>
<br />I am sure that this is not a difficult subject. Afterall, it is simple-ish mathematics. But the guy who wrote the book first of all tried to be funny. Second of all he tried to make the work very simple. The result of this is an un understandable book. (And trust me...some of the most clever guys are struggling with this) 
<br />
<br />The second subject, is Introduction to programming 2, which is c++. Now those of you who do programming will probably agree with me that programming is not all that complicated..most of the time. But in the textbook, most examples doesn't work and the explanations are very confusing. OK, you could blame a lack of knowledge of programming for this, but even guys who already are proficient in programming are struggling with the textbook.
<br />
<br />A lot of the students complain about these two textbooks and cannot really progress. Now for the first subject, I've practically been busy rewriting the textbook in language understandable to me, without all the cr*p the guy put in.  As for the second textbook I am lucky enough to have programming knowledge from school and also friends that can help me. 
<br />
<br />OK, now what I want to get to is the following two points: 
<br />
<br />1)If you simplyfy something too much, you actually complicated, true or false? Thoughts?
<br />
<br />2)Why do universities use textbooks that make studying almost impossible for students?

			<div class="content">Um... well, as somebody who helps people figure out some fairly complicated stuff (both here and elsewhere)... my feelings on this are:
<br />
<br />1.  You can never make things &quot;too simple&quot;.  You can, however, make things look &quot;simple&quot; by avoiding necessary steps.  This is a problem, no matter what you're teaching.  
<br />
<br />I ran into this not long ago, when I made a tutorial here about how to skin 3D models- something that I regard as being &quot;simple&quot;, but most people find very difficult to get the hang of, including many people who are proficient in 3D modeling techniques and methods.
<br />
<br />After getting feedback, I added quite a few &quot;pages&quot; to the book, and all of a sudden... boom... people started getting it.  I'd basically just skipped over some steps that were, to me, quite obvious.  To newbies, they were bottomless chasms.  Teaching is tricky.
<br />
<br />2.  There are some things that are hard no matter how simple you make them, because there are certain steps that are difficult and cannot be done by following directions.  
<br />
<br />Explaining how to gut large portions of Freelancer's codebase, for example, can be done- but how to explain to anybody who doesn't already have a very good grasp of the complexities involved?  I can't- and when I try, I realise that my explanations aren't going to help most readers much at all, because they just lack too much context.
<br />
<br />
<br />Basically, there is no excuse for how poorly-written most CS texts are, and if you're going to do all of your courses via Distance Learning... get a tutor, because the texts will generally stay that way.  
<br />
<br />Think about it for a moment.  Your books are written by dweebs who aren't quite hot enough to be in the Industry making massive $$$ (read, professors) to impress their fellow dweebs (faculty administrators) so that they can become promoted (to administrators) and continue the process.  It's not that they don't <i>want to educate you, </i> but many of them aren't so hot themselves.  If you're lucky, you'll get somebody who just recently burned out, and they'll still be sharp enough to be worth learning from.  Most of the professors I dealt with were has-beens who thought FORTRAN was still a hot language <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />99% of the theory you will learn in school will not get used in the real world, unless you happen to be so brilliant and theoretically-inclined that you're slotted for high-end government research projects with supercomputers or other exotica, where you might actually give a damn about some of the statistical coding techniques you'll be presented with in class.  99% of the people with CS degrees either don't use them, or program for companies in the real world... who want you to be <i>clever </i> but not waste time being <i>perfectly cute. </i>  I work with real-world programmers, and they're generally fitting new programming jobs in with lots of other IT tasks.  It's not fancy-schmancy stuff- it's work.
<br />
<br />Almost 100% of the theory you learn in the first year will actually be useful as a backbone, until technology changes the rules again.  The vast majority of the theory you learn later will be largely useless, and greatly outdated by the time you graduate.  
<br />
<br />All I have to say to young CS majors is this:  get into internships as rapidly as possible.  Pass your classes, enjoy school, but get Real World Experience, or your vaunted &quot;hard science&quot; degree that you've worked so hard for will be worth as much as an English Major's... and they, at least, got to read well-written texts and good books <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  If you don't want your post-graduate world to include phrases like, &quot;do you want fries with that?&quot;, keep your head out of the clouds, and remember... you're spending all that time and money to get a <i>job </i> not to <i>learn. </i>  Idealism about education is one of the educational establishment's biggest ways to confuse young people about how poorly they're preparing them to compete in today's international economy... don't fall for it.  Even if you're going to Haaavahd, you're still going to vocational school.</div>

<br />
<br />@Argh, it could be that he was skipping over steps, but I dont really think so, he goes to such lengths to explain the stuff to you that you actually lose what he is trying to say and the he throws in all these absurd stories to try to make it easier, but which actually confuses you. While I was studying and re writing it for myself, I found places where he uses a whole page explaining something, leaving you puzzled, to suddenly realise what he is trying to say and then you can write it down for yourself in two sentences making much more sense.
<br />
<br />In a way I guess it depends on the way you understand things. Different people understand differently. I dunno, it just seems useless that he spends all this time trying to explain the work to you and then you still cannot understand it, because the explanation is too complicated. 
<br />
<br />Does that make sense? I dont know. Usually I dont make sense.

			<h3><a href="#p383852" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I'm in college, and I can honestly say two things:
<br />
<br />1)  Over-simplification, I dunno, never ran into it <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />2)  Text books are hard to understand because there aren't students writing these things.  They're PhD's or other people high up in the level of academics.
<br />
<br />Frankly, I find not only are textbooks sometimes trying too hard to sound &quot;smart&quot; they're WAAAAAY over priced.  I know every college students gripes about it, but seriously, when I pay $122 for a textbook, and the university bookstore buys it back at $47, then puts a &quot;used&quot; sticker on it, and then puts it back on the shelf for $99 I get pretty peeved.
<br />
<br />I've had a couple professor's who have outright said (against the university's policy...they wanna make money too...) &quot;Don't buy the textbook, or if you do share the cost with a friend.  You'll learn a lot more in here, than in those books.&quot;
<br />
<br />Also, I've had some classes where they just throw out a frew chapters because they make no sense.  Funny.  I <i>suppose </i> my professors could be complete doofs who don't understand the material, but for 24,000 a year (Don't even get me started on THAT one...) I would <b>hope </b> that I'm getting what I'm paying for.
<br />
<br />So yes, I agree.  Textbooks, as far as I'm concerned, are needlessly complicated.</div>
