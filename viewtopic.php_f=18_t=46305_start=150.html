			<div class="content">For interest, i wrote a comparison program. It reads the original Freelancer path file (legal in this instance) and my generated path file (legal).
<br />
<br />If anyone is interesting in the workings, all paths are read in from the original FL file and stored in a collection (two actually, it's quick and dirty this way - took about 5 mins to make it you see <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).
<br />
<br />Then, the comparison file is read in. Each string is similarly trimmed, IF it is already existing in the collection (constant time search) of Freelancer paths - then it's an identical path generation, all is good... so no need to record this. It's discarded... at the same time, it's removed from the second collection (you can see now that this will eventually hold just paths from original FL that my generated doesn't have!).
<br />
<br />If it's NOT in the existing Freelancer collection, it's a new path! It's put into a TreeSet (it's a set that has an natural ordering - alphabetical when dealing with strings).
<br />Next up, it's simple... we add the collection of FL paths that aren't in mine (so basically we've done an symmetric difference... i just couldn't be arsed to either find a set collection which had this method in it, or program one up) into a TreeSet (alphabetical) and then output.
<br />

			<div class="content">That's really awsome work there Chips.
<br />That sounds like a perfect way to add new paths.
<br />So, the program compares the entries, trims off the duplicates 
<br />and add the new path to the tree?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />A couple of questions come to mind here...
<br />Since I see that Li05 is not listed in the tree...
<br />I'm assuming that's one of the &quot;illegal&quot; paths.
<br />So, what happens if you turn it into a &quot;legal&quot; ?
<br />Is it simply added to the string as a new entry?
<br />
<br />
<br />Curret progress on my mess:
<br />I've removed all particular references to systems connected by jump holes 
<br />from the legal path.ini copy so far. 
<br />What I want to do here is keep those paths out of the picture and make sure 
<br />that only systems that are connected by jump gates are listed in the legal 
<br />path file. 
<br />
<br />Next I have to make sure that all systems with jump holes are 
<br />listed in the illegal path file.  (this is going to be a large file since it also 
<br />includes all the new systems and existing &quot;retrofits&quot; )</div>

			<div class="content">The above is just a comparison in differences using the existing paths in stock Freelancer - no mods, no nothing. Li05 isn't in the legal paths because despite having a jumpgate (which we treat as definition of legal), it's specificed that the jumpgate is locked in the initialworld.ini file <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />If you open up the Shortest_Legal_Path.ini file that comes with Freelancer, my program produces the same path as 1000 paths in the file.
<br />The 100 or so (or 215 or so) paths that differ are identical in length to the Freelancer stock and my generated ones, the difference is that mine used one way (see the Iw03/04 switch over) to reach a location compared to the stock way using another. Same jump distance, and both work just as well. That is all the post is supposed to highlight, that it produces same distance jump paths, it produces identical to original game in many paths - and where it doesn't, it's a simple difference between which system to pass through.
<br />
<br />
<br />This just goes to show that the generation does work (for anyone sceptical) and we're trying to iron out possible crinkles by ensuring we're being as transparent as possible about what the programs output is - hence, posting what actual differences the program generates compared to the normal Freelancer ones.
<br />
<br />Should this cause an issue? (the differences?) - it should not, no. It could do with more testing than what I have done upon it so far, if I get time to test at the weekend I will see <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Chips, forgive me if I seem ignorant. I got a little lost and overwhelmed by all
<br />the path figures you posted there.
<br />
<br />Those you posted are paths that are not typical Freelancer stock, right?
<br />I looked for the typical trouble maker: Li01, Iw03 and didn't see it there.
<br />Since the legal path would look like this...
<br />Li, Iw03, Li01, Li02, Iw03
<br />and
<br />Iw03, Li01, Iw03, Li02, Li01
<br />
<br />I suppose for the shortcut to Magellan to be considered at all, it would
<br />probably have to be included in illegal paths so it would be ignored 
<br />by the path engine consideration for mapping.
<br />
<br />Then, as for the Alaska gate (which is legal but locked) 
<br />It seems that it can be unlocked and considered in the stock version 
<br />since it's a dead end system anyhow.
<br />But in instances where Li05 reaches out and touches other systems 
<br />via alien jump gate or jump holes, the Alaska Gate can still be considered 
<br />legal and unlocked. The plotting path would simply end in Alaska.
<br />But any other connections between Alaska and 
<br />whatever would have to be considered &quot;illegal&quot;  so the path engine 
<br />won't try to utilize it.
<br />Is this a correct assumption?

			<div class="content">Hehe, don't forget - I am generating them on Stock Freelancer, clean install - no mods <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />In stock Freelancer, the path to Iw03 goes through Li02 - there's no direct route, the gates locked. If you look in the original path files, you find the path doesn't exist via the Li01_to_Iw03 jumpgate.
<br />
<br />It's jumpgate is in the initialworlds.ini locked entries - so it's not to be used - Digital Anvil made the route unavailable.
<br />
<br />Same for Alaska. Paths to Alaska don't exist in Freelancers' normal files - it's out of bounds. Another locked gate.
<br />
<br />So when generating the paths, I take into consideration gates in the game which are locked (hence initialworld.ini requirement - but since I don't know how to hash things, I asked for it to include the nickname of locked gates). Means mods can lock gates, unlock them, and generate paths accordingly. Any changes, or alterations to the universe, just a quick run of the application and it'll provide new files (that's the intention anyway).
<br />
<br />So that's why those paths aren't here, this is Freelancer stock. The path never exists in the game (apart from storyline, but storyline appears to sort it out when needed) originally.
<br />
<br />If we unlock the gate you'd see significantly different paths all over <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So the above quoted paths i put up are comparing the only differences between Standard Installed Freelancers paths, and my generated ones. As pointed out, the difference lies in which system it takes to reach an objective and the paths are equal in length. 
<br />
<br />I hypothesise that it doesn't matter which one it is, and won't cause crashes, because I've tested it. However, if the actual order did matter, I'd by amazingly suprised that the game could ever manage with custom paths at all (they're not going to be expected) - so I am positive it's all fine. I just wanted to point out that on Stock FL, teh path generation is near as damn it identical to original Freelancer, and where it isn't... it's something that really doesn't affect it <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I hope, anyway.</div>

			<div class="content">I see how that worked on the stock Freelancer gates then.
<br />It seems then modding the paths tends to get somewhat messy 
<br />especially for idiots like me who didn't consider the consequences 
<br />in the first place when opening up otherwise &quot;locked&quot; paths.
<br />(eh...live and learn)
<br />I did a test run of the path generator again on the 20 Years Later mod.
<br />I had it generate all three path files and saved them into a folder 
<br />for comparison. Marked respectively as system shortest 
<br />(weighted 14 to something)
<br />Shortest legal then Shortest Illegal .
<br />
<br />Then I took a look at them.
<br />Sure enough, there were duplications between illegal and legal path ini's.
<br />This must be the reason for the ctd's.
<br />Now, I don't know exactly what caused this problematic mix up.
<br />1. A wild guess is that is had something to do with removing the locked gate and hole references in the initialworld.ini.
<br />(eh. all I was trying to do was unlock those items for multiplayer...
<br />which worked for most of them)
<br />2. Another guess here must be in connecting new systems with jump holes and setting them to &quot;legal&quot; instead of illegal.
<br />
<br />I don't know of any other way to change this other than going into the files 
<br />and editing those entries. (Removing the illegal path duplicates from the legal 
<br />path and rewriting the correct path). 
<br />
<br />Except perhaps where I can use the stock freelancer references 
<br />as a base then hand editing the new paths into the correct respective file.
<br />
<br />A theory I have for certain &quot;outside&quot; system legal interconnections leaves them 
<br />isolated from the stock Freelancer paths...(should leave them isolated)
<br />but plotable only when you're in those systems. 
<br />This should effectively leave the stock files alone.
<br />
<br />I think I'll try it from that angle. Place the stock path files in the mod, 
<br />then add by hand the new path files into their respective file.
<br />As for certain gates and holes that were meant to be locked, 
<br />(as reference in the initialworld.ini)
<br />Since that reference was removed, do you think it would be a safe bet 
<br />to enter those paths as &quot;illegals&quot; ? (I'm willing to give that a shot to test 
<br />it out)</div>

			<div class="content">One thing I noticed about FLScans path generation is that legal was a huge file...
<br />
<br />It should be the smallest.
<br />As for duplicate paths, they do exist in all three files <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So for Li01 to Li02... same in all three. There's a jumpgate and a jumphole <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Same for a lot of paths - any systems that are connected by jumpgates and jumpholes will be able to appear in shortest, legal and illegal.
<br />
<br />So if you had a string of 10 systems all connected in a line with jumpgates and jumpholes, they'd all appear in the three path files with exactly the same entries to each other <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Just in FL not all systems do have a jumpgate and jumphole to connecting systems, at which point we differ... mainly in border worlds and so forth, as they tend to go jumphole only in some.</div>

			<div class="content">Something I just noticed earlier this evening while looking over the path files.
<br />I noticed this pattern: 
<br />
<br />In shortest legal path,
<br />The first reference system is Li01.
<br />After that, each subsequent system always has Li01 
<br />as the destination first entry.
<br />This is of course all the connections by Agiera Gates.
<br />
<br />In shortest illegal path, 
<br />the first reference system is Hi01. (I don't know why)
<br />After that, each subsequent system always has Hi01 
<br />as the destination first entry.
<br />(sort of like an &quot;all roads leads to Rome&quot; scenario)
<br />This is all the connections by jump holes.
<br />
<br />I'm think I'm begining to see a method behind this madness.

			<div class="content">There is nothing new I can do for this. I am extremely confident that it matches the way people make paths themselves (from the experience of Breslin and I, no-one else seems able to vouch how they do it though - so meh). It produces the same paths I would by hand, so therefore I think it's path creation is sound and 100% correct. Certainly, no-one can prove otherwise in the face of testing that was undertaken and found to work in the miniscule variations that did exist <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />However, I see little point in carrying on. If some who professed to have working hand coded path files had uploaded as requested to see if it can generate the same (therefore confirming the theory is 100% right) it would have been helpful. Some are exceedingly sceptical about it, but without a &quot;demand&quot;, there's no point in putting anymore effort into it.
<br />
<br />Ergo, this is being consigned to the &quot;good idea, but doomed&quot; bin. For the record, I am positive this works fine and could save countless hours, days or even weeks of people's time to make them... but lack of &quot;market&quot; means - what's the point?
<br />
<br />Feel free to email me if any queries, interest or otherwise.

			<div class="content">Rankor,
<br />
<br />Adding a system by hand and in accordance with the path files generated by Chips' application -- this is tricky and time-consuming. It is easy to leave something out or get something wrong, especially if you're not sure what makes a path legal/illegal. The best way to do it is to go through every system and write a path from this system to the newly-added system; then at least you know you didn't leave anything out. You will get a bad behavior if you include a jump-hole traversal in 'legal paths', and you might cause a crash bug (or a bad loop) if you provide a path that is not in fact shortest.
<br />
<br />&gt; I got the familiar infamous
<br />&gt; server crash again when attempting to map to another system.
<br />
<br />First, there's nothing truly familiar about this. Or I should say -- it's not good debugging practice to treat bugs as &quot;known&quot; until they have been identified. Nobody has explained the conditions under which this bug expresses itself. (Last I heard it sounded like a problem in the intra-system auto-mapping, but then again these could be two different bugs.)
<br />
<br />It <i>sounds</i> like you're suggesting the bug is a result of the system you added (and pathed by hand). Did you try to remove this system (temporarily) and see if you get a crash using Chips' paths?
<br />
<br />My theory is that it has nothing to do with the paths, but with people using wonky gates for which the game has custom rules (like the dyson airlock, or the nomad gate, or the NY-Magellan gate that the game has a one-off rule for, or any other gate that the game has a custom (and probably embedded, un-moddable) rule for locking, etc.), or perhaps an arbitrary limit the game places on number-of-gates per system or something like this.
<br />
<br />It could very easily be that a correct path-file enables these bugs to express themselves -- and it could be that leaving them out of the path files causes the game to ignore the problem connections when doing its routing.
<br />
<br />For these and other reasons, I wouldn't look to the path files for answers here. Instead, I urge you to figure out which gate(s) are responsible for the crashes you're getting.
<br />
<br />&gt; I did finish a hand created version of the legal path files, but haven't tried to
<br />&gt; test this out yet.
<br />
<br />How long does it take you to hand-code an entire path file?! Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but if you're doing what I think you're doing, it would be at least like 20 hours of *tremendously* tedious work, which is *extremely* easy to get wrong. Any method you're using to hand-code the paths can be fairly easily made into a program, and the program would be *much* more reliable.

			<div class="content">Breslin,
<br />I spent roughly the equivalent of a 1 1/2 weeks worth of work on building 
<br />the legal path file by hand. (Somewhere around 60 hours)
<br />About 15 hours a day.
<br />As I said though, I haven't tested this out yet, but I'm pretty sure
<br />I used the &quot;Agiera Gates&quot; (mechanincal) as reference points.
<br />
<br />This gave me the option of deciding which path was shortest.
<br />When I compared that to Chips last generated path file, they were 
<br />nearly identical. So, I defered to Chips Shortest_Legal_Path.ini 
<br />and entered the new system connections to and from Ku06 through
<br />BW11. (Which also excludes the Li01 -&gt; Iw04 Gate)
<br />Deciding which path to plot in the .ini was a matter of physical count 
<br />of interconnected systems. But instead of building it up from the shortest 
<br />to the next system/next system, I went down the line of each system 
<br />by logical sequence.
<br />It looks like this:
<br />
<br />SystemConnections
<br />Path = Li01, Li01, Li01
<br />Path = Li01, Li02, Li01, Li02

<br />=====================
<br />It was to say the least, tedious. I also went back over all of them to find
<br />any inconsistency or typo between them.
<br />As a latent afterthought, some of the new systems could have been associated 
<br />with the standard systems instead of creating new prefixes.
<br />In the case new systems, the prefix lettering is all uppercase.</div>
