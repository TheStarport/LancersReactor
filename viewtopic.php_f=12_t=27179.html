<br />Earth And Beyond:  oldie but still maybe worthy, I dont know, i quit soon after release but things may have changed
<br />
<br />EvE Online: Heard about it, heard it can get boring, but heard its really tight after you get used to it

<br />Star Wars Galaxies: Havent we all heard too much about this one already to not know whats its about?
<br />
<br />Freelancer: This is kind of a stupid addition, as I already played through the game a bunch, basically burned out on it, but what im trying to say is if i should stay with it till something better comes along, anyway its literally a MMORPG, but its free, so it leaves the door open for another next to it.
<br />
<br />so.......im trying to decide, which one of the three, note, none of these games are particularly great, but I need at least ONE sci-fi MMORPG....... so pick the best of the three.

<br />PS: Whens the day a Sci-Fi MMORPG will truly be great?........ahhhh..... to dream

<br />
<br />-I also played Earth&amp;Beyond, from November last year to February before I switched ISP. Now I can't play, so what do I do? I choose a Space-sim that can let me play single-player, and you can't play E&amp;B single-player, so I chose Freelancer, albeit long after I switched ISP..............

<br />
<br />-Have only seen the trailer, and the graphics is very good. But as I said, I haven't tried it, so I cannot judge it beyond that it's an online-game-only.

<br />
<br />-Well, if you have played TIE-fighter vs X-wing (which I have done on the Zone), then it's very easy to make missions etc. Even a n00b like me made mission-files using the editor-software.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Freelancer: This is kind of a stupid addition, but its literally a MMORPG, but its free, so it leaves the door open for another next to it  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />-Not with story-line(s) and plots. When you've done, you're on your own, as a freelancer. And since you can play both SP and MP, then it's not an either or, but both - were you can play a modyfied game or not. The great thing with Freelancer is the open-ended solution and the freedom to do what you want. The next game from the producers will probably use their creativity to expand upon the thing they succeeded with, the game-play and the AI. The un-modified version of the AI is probably not as good as the modified, but it's a far step from other space-sims.

<br />
<br />-Pick Freelancer, if you haven't tried it already. I remember when I piloted the TIE Interceptor in TIE-fighter vs X-wing (the fastest and most agile fighter in my opinion in the Star Wars-game universe, I didn't much like the shielded X-wings, they were way too slow....). And when I was playing E&amp;B, I was a terran trader, lvl 135 (you'll know how much time it takes to get this high up in lvl...). I could buy ore, make parts, then devices and weapons, engines and shields. Although I maxed weapons-making skills... Ahhh, these were times, when six people could group up and fly formation, kill monsters and beasts (MOB's). And they could be everybody out of many many, I think the max was 128 members simultanously. And I also remeber that I gave 200% engines to some n00b's for free (trader, being _rich_). Every weapons I made was 200% &lt;*sigh*&gt; Hmmm, nostalgia <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />When they blend Freelancer with E&amp;B - hmmm, I think they have already done that with X2. I'll take a peek at it when it's released in Feb next year, but for now it's Freelancer all the way.

			<div class="content">wow, first, i keep miswording posts and people keep think i dont know anything about freelancer (for your info actually I played through it a buncha times, got the best fighters and equipment, played multiplayer a ton, in fact, im pretty bored of it now)
<br />
<br />second, Star Wars Galaxies is a completely different game, the ultimate goal is to become a jedi and it has nothing even remotely to do with space combat (hence my use of the words Sci-Fi)
<br />
<br />third, I was on Orion Galaxy, level 150 Progen Warrior, it was quite easy to level, time consuming, but really really easy actually. I didnt make weapons, but I had the best beam and projectile weapons money can buy, I was also fully affiliated with The Red Dragon Pirates. Wasnt necesarilly rich, but once i got my ammo building skills, all the weapons i needed i found the game to be really boring afterwards, sure there was the Epic mobs, but those sucked, same thing as every other hunt i ever been on. I currently play Dark Age Of Camelot and its basically everything i ever wanted in a game, I mean, i truly consider it to be the best game ever created as a MMORPG. Check it out, i just figured i need some sci-fi in there somewhere, but i still play DAOC daily, heres a character page <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />

<br />
<br />Im currently reallly satisfied with it....... especially with the new expansion, and at the moment am one of the highest ranking officers in my guild.
<br />
<br />PS: Earth and Beyond supported up to 5,000 players per server, oh, and i did sign on to it in november, cuz for 1 week in november they let all old players play free for the whole week, and i noticed that the games population has dwindled terribly, its hard to even find a group over 2-3 people, and even those are mostly powerleveling groups.
