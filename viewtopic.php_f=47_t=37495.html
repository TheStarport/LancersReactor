<br />
<br />Jan 8
<br />3 AM
<br />Manhatten surface, NW Hemisphere
<br />
<br />It was a Still night on manhatten, liberty. A few people walked about doing things that they elft for night foolishly.
<br />But one by one as they drifted to sleep people awoke to do things that were best done under the cover of night.
<br />
<br />A young man, about 6'1 in height, blue spiked hair and Metal army boots walked down the street. A holster at his side where he kept his
<br />Trusty blaster. He entered a small tavern and sat on a stool.
<br />
<br />&quot;Heya newcomer first time on manhatten?&quot; The bartender said with a dumb friendly grin on his face
<br />
<br />&quot;No&quot; The man said coldly &quot;Just here on biz... Rhienlander vodka for me&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Normally i would say we only server liberty ale but you look like you've worked ahrd and deserve a treat&quot; The bartender said slightly nervous.
<br />&quot;Here you go&quot;
<br />
<br />The man took a good gulp of his drink when another man entered the bar. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ahey!&quot; The man just entered yelled with joy &quot;Dev! long time no see!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Right back at ya Sark.&quot; Dev said sipping his vodka &quot;You got the stuff&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Cost me 1 mill but well worth what you and me can turn it into&quot; Sark said quickly 
<br />
<br />&quot;If its whats on the list it should get us 10 maybe 20 mill from the right buyers&quot; Dev said with a dumb grin
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah... look i got, not on me of course. but you have a frieghter that has some space lets do biz on there not in public&quot;  Sark said now looking rather worried
<br />
<br />&quot;Chill, i place a bunch of disruptors there. they wont get a clear signal and that doesnt authorize them to do a optical search. it will look like im carrying potatos&quot; Dev said 
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn expensive potatos&quot; Sark mumbled &quot;Lets go!&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Jan 8
<br />3:15 AM
<br />Battleship Freedom in orbit of manhatten
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhm Captain..&quot; a nervous private said to clearly the captain &quot;Here are the reports by Lt.Derinton&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Excellent private, is something wrong?&quot; The general asked
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah... Derinton didnt seem rather pleased when he handed me these. im guessing its bad news.. gotta be pretty bad to irk Deriton..&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Private i would prefere you be more professinal when adressing the senior staff.In any case leave me to read this&quot; The General said grimly
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />&quot;Here she be Sark&quot; Dev said swelling with pride &quot;The finest fastest ship in all of siruis... best suited for the job&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And to think you used to fly her for IC&quot; Sark said, smirking
<br />
<br />&quot;Aye... She deserves better...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Holding millions of dollars worth of illegal guns seems to suite her&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;damn straight! Now lets get inside and check over the loot...&quot;
<br />
<br />End Chapter 1

<br />
<br />Jan 9
<br />2 pm Manhatten time
<br />8 clicks out of Manhatten orbit
<br />
<br />3 wings of fighters cut through the space dodging occasional debris and asteriods. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Alpha leader did you get briefed on why the hell were flying 8-10 clicks out in the middle of no-were?&quot; A voice said over the Com channel of the ships
<br />
<br />&quot;Not really Beta leader&quot; Alpha leader said &quot;Something about a crime ring and security.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The damn generals are so bloody worried over nothing...&quot; Beta leader said sounding annoyed &quot;I bet you a months pay its a blue milk run&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I think the top knows what its doing&quot; Alpha said coldly
<br />
<br />&quot;Or maybe they dont...&quot; Beta said getting paraniod &quot;There as human as we are...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Look your wing to your markers and i'll fly my wing to my markers&quot; Alpha said rather fed up 
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine fine... Call me if you get anything&quot; Beta said giving up
<br />
<br />&quot;Likewise&quot; alpha said
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Jan 9
<br />2:30 Manhatten time
<br />Manhatten centeral
<br />
<br />Dev climbed up a ladder and into the cockpit of his ship. Still groggy after just waking up he stumlbed over the controls
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey sark..&quot; He said sleepily on a COM channel &quot;You in your ship?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes indeedy&quot; Sark said eagerily &quot;Ready to pull this off?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh yeah!&quot; Dev said with a chuckle &quot;man we are gunna make HISTORY! I have the weapons loaded you create static and cover me&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that!&quot; Sark said &quot;Lets roll out!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;see you in space!&quot; Dev replied
<br />
<br />One Dromdary frieghter and a Dagger light fighter took off slowly into the sky. Sark was a bit nervous even with the excitment.
<br />They were smuggling some major contraband and possibly under the new liberty &quot;Freespace&quot; act they could be shot and killed on sight and scan
<br />
<br />&quot;This is battleship freedom of the liberty navy calling to flight group 1030441 we are proceeding a scan of your cargo bay. Do not leave the area&quot;  A voice crackled over Dev's COM
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that freedom&quot; Dev said quickly &quot;Hey Sarky Activate that static now... prepare to blast the hell out of here&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sure thing Dev&quot; Sark said grinning over the video screen &quot;These suckers are easier then Bretonian police.. heh Bretonian police what a joke&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is battleship freedom&quot; The voice on the COM said exasperated &quot;To much static... proceed with your duties&quot;
<br />
<br />Dev blasted his cruise engines with sark following. They dipped up over manhatten towards the back of the planet and headed on there way.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Jan 9
<br />3:00 manhatten time
<br />7 clicks of manhatten
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Alpha leader&quot; Beta leader said sounding worried
<br />
<br />&quot;What now Beta&quot; Alpha leader said sounding annoyed
<br />
<br />&quot;I am picking up to contacts, in formation. I am rpoceeding out of there scanner range, but i should be able to get a clear scan of there cargo&quot; Beta leader said sounding excited 
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright Beta proceed with caution&quot; Alpha replied &quot;Oh and before you start, save the gloating for the bar&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Haha!&quot; Beta laughed &quot;You got it&quot;
<br />
<br />Beta wing shot forward towards the planet. Beta leader was sweating alot inside his cockpit. 
<br />It had been a odd patrol and if this wasnt just a bunch of college idiots it could mean trouble.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright were scanning swere scanning&quot; Beta said sounding a bit relieved, already assuming it was nothing.
<br />
<br />&quot;Man should we come over to you guys&quot; Delta leader said
<br />
<br />&quot;Naw i think we-Oh shoot, get the hell over here... these guys are carrying highly illgela contraband i repeat highly illegal contraband. Under freespace act we have to take them down!&quot;

<br />
<br />&quot;Dev do you see that?&quot; Sark yelled over the COM link
<br />
<br />&quot;See what?&quot; Dev replied 
<br />
<br />&quot;9 Bloody contacts coming inbound  attack formation!&quot; Sark said sounding worried and 
<br />
<br />angry
<br />
<br />&quot;What the f-They must have long range scanners! can you take them?&quot; Dev said
<br />
<br />&quot;I dunno man... 9 elite fighters.&quot; Sark said with a sigh
<br />
<br />&quot;Just tank for me and i'll give you cover fire&quot; Dev ordered &quot;I think we could take them!&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />Sark's fighter shot off ahead of Dev. Beta wing came up above sark and alpha came from 
<br />
<br />below.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright beta leader you fly your wing down on them and i'll hit em in the rear. Delta you go 
<br />
<br />for that transport, dont bother to take anyone alive. i want them all dead, you hear me all 
<br />
<br />dead!&quot; Alpha barked
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that alpha coming in!&quot; Beta leader said
<br />
<br />&quot;You can count on delta to take them down&quot; Delta leader yelled &quot;Yeehah lets kick some 
<br />
<br />ass!&quot;
<br />
<br />Sark cut his engines and the two wings blasted ahead of him. Then he shot up by beta wing 
<br />
<br />and started to fire.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is beta 2 im taking heavy fire! i repeat heavy fire&quot; One of the wingmen screamed
<br />
<br />Sark launched a missle that slamed into beta 2's hull in massive explosion, sending shards of 
<br />
<br />debris into space.
<br />
<br />&quot;Dear god...&quot; Beta leader said morbidly &quot;Beta 2 is dead.. you think you can take them Beta 
<br />
<br />wing&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;All of you back off him, head for the transport with delta. I'll get revenge.&quot; Beta leader spat 
<br />
<br />out
<br />
<br />&quot;Your life not mine sir&quot; Beta 3 said &quot;Moving out&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright alpha wing, you heard beta leader lets go!&quot; Alpha leader yelled
<br />
<br />
<br />Beta leader came right to the side of sark and started to gun. Sark's cockpit was rocked with 
<br />
<br />the force of the blasts and sparks started to fly.
<br />Sark  flew above beta and opened the cargo bay dropping torpedos onto beta leaders ship. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn dev i cant get cle-&quot;
<br />
<br />The explosion engulfed the two ships in flame resulting in more minor explosions leaving little 
<br />
<br />left of the 2 ships. 
<br />
<br />&quot;You sons of a- Blood hell your all dead&quot; Dev yelled in open area COM
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright all units Take him down!&quot; Alpha leader yelled &quot;Base this is alpha requesting a back 
<br />
<br />up wing!&quot;
<br />
<br />Several fighters shot after Dev. Dev ahd to weave through constant laser fire, closer and 
<br />
<br />closer he flew to a asteriod belt.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright you bastards heres one for Sark!!!&quot; Dev yelled as his ship dropped 50-60 mines .
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir sir i cant dodge so many im getting overwhelmed&quot; A pilot yelled
<br />
<br />&quot;Fall back&quot; Alpha leader said sadly &quot;All fighters fall back.
<br />
<br />Dev was 3 clicks off by then and near a jumphole. Without hesitation he Shot into the hole 
<br />
<br />and to the system that lay beyond it

<br />
<br />Chapter 4
<br />Jan 10
<br />
<br />
<br />Dev awoke feeling rather groggy, he looked around and stifled a yell. a fair amount of his 
<br />
<br />blood was smeared on the cockpit and the window. He could smell smoke and flame, his ship 
<br />
<br />was burning. This meant his oxygen supply was being consumed faster then normal. 
<br />
<br />Engines were offline and everything was a mess. Dev wiped some off the blood on the 
<br />
<br />window and realized he was slowly being pulled back into the jumphole he used. He sighed 
<br />
<br />and glanced at the radar and saw 3 ships on a aproach vector.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright Dev.&quot; a voice said over the COM &quot;We know what your carrying, the rouges want 
<br />
<br />it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey mate&quot; Dev yelled over the COM &quot;Listen you come aboard and we'll deal with this 
<br />
<br />alright?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright&quot; The rouge said &quot;Men keep your guns locked on the ship. If it makes a move shoot 
<br />
<br />it.&quot;
<br />
<br />The rouge ship landed ontop Devs space craft. Dev turned towards the door of the cockpit 
<br />
<br />and drew his gun. Two men strode in and Dev pulled his gun and fired, killing the bodygaurd 
<br />
<br />of the rouge.
<br />
<br />The rouge pulled his gun and pressed it to Devs forehead
<br />
<br />&quot;Big mistake you son of a-&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;For you&quot; Dev said with a sick grin on his face. He lifed his other hand and showed the rouge 
<br />
<br />the remote detonator for some sort of bomb.
<br />
<br />&quot;Listen you idiot, im not gunna hand over my goods to you. We do things my way otherwise i 
<br />
<br />blow us all to hell. Now call your buddies up and tell them you'll be staying aboard the ship 
<br />
<br />and that there to escort us to buffalo base. Otherwise you, me, them, and all the loot is blown 
<br />
<br />to hell. Do you understand&quot; Dev said coldly
<br />
<br />&quot;If you think you can pull this-&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you understand ro do i have to kill us all&quot; Dev said through his teeth.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes&quot; the rouge replied bitterly &quot;Men im staying aboard escort us home.&quot;
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Jan 10
<br />New york
<br />9 pm Manhatten time.
<br />Orbit of manhatten.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir?&quot; a soldier said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes?&quot; The general of battleship freedom said &quot;What is it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Leader of alpha wing is here to see you.&quot; The soldier said sweating nevously
<br />
<br />&quot;Send him in&quot; The general said facing the window of his office. Outside ships flew by landing 
<br />
<br />and leaving manhatten.
<br />
<br />Alpha leader, still in his flightsuite strode in and saluted the General.
<br />
<br />&quot;General.&quot; Alpha leader said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lt.Venderson, we have much to discuss.&quot; The general said emotionessly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Look if its about the patrol we did everything we could and we lost alot of good men. The 
<br />
<br />only man to be put at fault is the criminal for trying to undermine this great nation that i have 
<br />
<br />sworn to serve&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A nation you failed to serve&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well maybe if HQ wasnt so damned stupid my best friend would not be dead!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Or maybe is he knew how to fly and if he wasnt promoted purley by error&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;General, he was the best pilot in the fleet!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well then im going to have to speak to the admiral. Your failure was inexcusable, if the 
<br />
<br />rouges get there hands on those weapons there is no telling what they could do&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And if command had the guts to take out buffalo base then we could defeat the rouges. and 
<br />
<br />if we killed the junkers as well... But no we need the junkers to tell us who is gunna steal the 
<br />
<br />admirals ass scratcher whislt they give aid to the enemy and help our enemy kill good liberty 
<br />
<br />boys.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If you are saying the admiral or i is any less of a patriot...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well you clearly dont know were your priorities stand&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh we do Lt. we do&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh i guess your just a idiot sir&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Dismissed.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />8 pm
<br />orbit of manhatten
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Lt.venderson!&quot; a bright faced cadet yelled out in the cantina
<br />
<br />&quot;Thats Rory, ive been discharged for unorderly conduct...&quot; Rory said with a sigh
<br />
<br />&quot;Gee Ror thats aful&quot; The cadet said
<br />
<br />&quot;Take a seat sam..&quot; Rory said as he gulped his ale &quot;Your in alpha wing now?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Sam said proudly &quot;Wingsman marcus is now the leader so... they needed a fill in&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well kiddo&quot; Rory said with a grumble &quot;You'll be dead. Those 2 took out Dax and a few other pilots better then you'll ever be!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Gee Ror no need to take it out on me...&quot; Sam said sounding very upset
<br />
<br />&quot;Why not? You should go tell the general, tell the admiral only vets can handle this...&quot; Rory said
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh?&quot; Same whispered &quot;Dont think im up to it. You couldnt kill 2 smugglers, some pilot you are&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Watch it&quot; Rory said sounding extremly annoyed &quot;If i cant take two of these guys with beta, delta and my own wing-&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Not your wing&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Then you dont have  a chance in hell.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Shut up you idiot&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Go to hell... Marcus isnt a replacment for me, your not a replacment for him!&quot; Rory shouted &quot;You cherries have underminded everything us vets who fought hard at the battle of the badlands! With you in seat terrorism has already won.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What the hell is eating you?&quot; Sam spat at him 
<br />
<br />&quot;The fact that everything that i fought for, the fact that what my best friend died for is all going to be ruined by a cherry like you.&quot; Rory hissed &quot;Do you realize that with those illegal weapons a terrorist group could take over a system&quot;
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Devs ship cruised towards buffalo base the other two rouge ships around him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yo buff base we clear or what&quot; Dev said with a smile 
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that, Captain Traon is awaiting you.&quot;
<br />
<br />Devs ship landed on board the base. The ramp went down and as he walked 30 men had guns pointed at him. in the middle was a huge man grinning.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah good to see you&quot; the man said &quot;I am Traon. now you have 45 seconds to convince me why not to kill you and sieze the weapons&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well&quot; Dev said grinning &quot;I am holding 2 detonators for bombs in my cargo hold and bombs wired to me. the resulting explosion would collapse the station. Also if that wasnt enough the bombs are tied to my life system.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Impressive&quot; Traon sad &quot;Not bad at all, men take him&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah another mistake, some of the bombs are on me, the detonator is wired by a cord. if the bombs are removed or the cord severed. your going to die.&quot; Dev said holding back laughter &quot;Face it youve gotta pay me 700,000,000 or we all die. Trust me i will know if i get the money&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Wire him the bloody money&quot; Traon spat as Dev rolled on the floor laughing. &quot;Your smart indeed. Now i suppose after we unload everything you'll be on your way.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Gladly big guy. ill unlock the ship and disarm the bombs when i have the cash.&quot; Dev said chuckling &quot;ah  Sark thought this might of been hard. How wrong&quot;

<br />Chapter 6
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Jan 13
<br />6 pm
<br />Planet denver
<br />
<br />Rory sat in his home watching the the t.v. A boring news program, but all Rory did since his lose of his job was watch the news.
<br />
<br />&quot;In other news Admiral Yowische is proposing a piracy crack down the the other high ranking officals in the Liberty Navy. Increased patrols and ship production was recomended.&quot; The news caster said in the typical dull voice news casters have.
<br />
<br />Rory flicked the T.V off, he sipped his ale and wondered what to do. Then his phone rang suddenly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hello&quot; He mumbled into the phone
<br />
<br />&quot;Heya Alpha leader!&quot; a voice shouted
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey hey!&quot; Rory said sounding happy &quot;How goes life Lt.Erick Verila&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thats Captain Verila, leader of wings Delta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma&quot; Erick said with a chuckle &quot;You either were a flaming idiot talking to that admiral that way or you know something i dont&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'll take idiot&quot; Rory said grinning &quot;So what do i owe this pleasure&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well i read your debriefings mission reviews and was about to call you a nut when i thought, hey this is the man who lead us to victory in the badlands.&quot; Erick said &quot;I figured you need our help so here is the deal. I have located a bunch of ol vets and we have some intel on the rouge plans. Look Bud i'll have a shuttle to our fleet awaiting at the nearest starport.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright&quot; Rory said &quot;Lets ride&quot;
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Dev's ship hovered in empty space. He stood looking out the window to the stars. Sighing he went to the controls and turned the ship setting a course to housten.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sark&quot; He said slowly &quot;I'll fix this all&quot;
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Rory looked out the window of the shuttle he was on to a small station.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well rory&quot; Erick said proudly &quot;That is our base of operations&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You havent told me what were doing yet Erick&quot; Rory said
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh you'll see&quot; Erick mumbled with a chuckle &quot;Were docking with the station now. 
<br />
<br />Erick's shuttle slowly entered the docking port with the small station. The ship slowly set down and Rory and erick walked off.
<br />
<br />&quot;This&quot; Erick said with a smile &quot;Is what will end the pirate threat in liberty&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This thing&quot; Rory said puzzled &quot;You gotta be kidding&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You of all people should know&quot; Erick said &quot;Its not the technology its the people. Follow me to the briefing room&quot;
<br />
<br />Erick and Rory walked down the corridors and into a room were a bunch of pilots were gathered by a screen.
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain on deck!&quot; One of them yelled.
<br />
<br />All of the men rose and saluted Erick.
<br />
<br />&quot;As you were&quot; Erick said grinning &quot;I suppose you all know Rory, the uncredited founder of our operations&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hiya all&quot; Rory said &quot;Whats up&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Actualy sir... Er sirs&quot; One of the pilots said &quot;We got a... Uhm insider in the thingy... Err the rouge operation thingy... Yeah hes uhm in the holding cell... He wants to... uhm speak with you sir... sirs&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Bring him up here soldier.&quot; Erick said grinning
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes sirs... er sir&quot; The Pilot said with a salute
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh pilot&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Try speaking clearer&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes uhm sir&quot;
<br />
<br />Rory sat down and looked at the screen were a pilot was breifing the others.
<br />
<br />&quot;Now everyone, we dont know much about these weapons. We know there powerful and thats about it. and that the rouges are willing to pay alot for it. now we have located a 20k area of were they are going to assemble there fleet.&quot; The pilot who was giving the presentation said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Excuse me but i know where&quot;

<br />
<br />Everyone in the room turned and saw a man in handcuffs escorted by two guards. The man 
<br />
<br />grinned. 
<br />
<br />&quot;In fact&quot; he said &quot;I know just about everything. Allow me to introdcue myself. i am Dev, 
<br />
<br />ex-IemCorp engineer and chief desginer of these products and there modifcations.&quot;
<br />
<br />Rory stood up and pointed at Dev &quot;Your the Son of a ***** that killed my best friend&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Correction&quot; Dev said grinning &quot;I am the son of a ***** that was with the man who killed 
<br />
<br />your best friend. You must be Alpha leader, and that would mean Lt.Rory Venderson&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thats right&quot; Rory mumbled slowly
<br />  
<br />&quot;Now&quot; Dev said popping off the handcuffs and producing a data disk from his pocket &quot;This 
<br />
<br />baby contains all the info you need to take out the rouges. In addition it contains info needed 
<br />
<br />to acess my Seven hundred million creds&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;How the hell did you get your handcuffs off and sneak that data disk in&quot; Erick yelled
<br />
<br />&quot;Gotta get your hands dirty if you wanna survive, tenderfoot&quot; Dev said grinning.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well Mr.Dev i suppose you would be willing to give us a presentation of what you know on 
<br />
<br />these superweapons&quot; Erick said 
<br />
<br />Dev walked up infront of everyone &quot;With pleasure. Now there are three componets. A a 
<br />
<br />modified Rhienlander prototype energy capacitator&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Excuse me sir&quot; One of the pilots said &quot;Some of us are simple soldiers, we dont dabble in 
<br />
<br />your... area.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah&quot; Dev said smirking &quot;Now what i mean is basicly this item can produce massive amounts 
<br />
<br />of energy. Why would rouges need this? simple the superweapons couldnt be powered by 
<br />
<br />anything less. Now the second item is a massive high defense shield. this thing can take a 
<br />
<br />volley from three destroyers and stay at 75%. Third the superweapon itself is basicly a laser. 
<br />
<br />the thing about this laser is that its oh the size of your newark station and has a attack speed 
<br />
<br />of a standard missile. The turret that fires it is mountable on a dagger. sounds impossible? 
<br />
<br />Wrong! now what the turret does is it compresses the laser in the hopper so that the laser is 
<br />
<br />1/1000 of its proper size. Then when shot it expands to the size of Newark. This gun can fire 
<br />
<br />every 2-3 minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;how the hell can we stop that?&quot; one of the pilots yelled
<br />
<br />&quot;Well&quot; Dev said &quot;I thought you men would say that. I have made designs for a prototype 
<br />
<br />shield that can take roughly ten blasts of the weapon. Then i made designs for a modified 
<br />
<br />torpedo to disrupt the shield for 80 seconds. We need to get by the ship that has the weapons 
<br />
<br />mounted and disrupt the shields and destroy it&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'll try it&quot; Rory said slowly
<br />
<br />&quot;Wouldnt miss it for the world&quot; Erick said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well gentlemen i am going to need a ship, a wing of fighters  and a team of engineers to pull 
<br />
<br />this off.&quot; Dev said with a sigh
<br />
<br />&quot;I will consider it.&quot; Erick said
<br />
<br />End chap 7
<br />
<br />Chap 8
<br />
<br />&quot;Well Dev i have to hand this to you.&quot; Rory said &quot;You have equiped all the ships with state 
<br />
<br />of the art everything and the modified shields and torpedos in 48 hours.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;T'was nothing my man Rory&quot; Dev said grinning &quot;We got a brieifing now, considering the 
<br />
<br />attack time is 4 hours off meaning we have to intercept them in 2-3&quot;
<br />
<br />Dev walked off to the briefing room but Rory just stood there. He thought could he be 
<br />
<br />possibly on the side of good if he worked with a low-life criminal like Dev? Rory started 
<br />
<br />walking to the briefing room. &quot;Will he betray us?&quot; He thought. He strode into the briefing 
<br />
<br />room and took a seat. Dev was standing in front of all the pilots with Erick.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright everyone&quot; Dev said &quot;It is now 12 in the morning at 4 in the afternoon as civilians 
<br />
<br />are preparing to leave Newark station the rouge attack fleet is going to pop out and hit 
<br />
<br />newark with one of the blasts, destroying the station. With the shield enhancments on the 
<br />
<br />main attack vessel the LPI,LSF, and LN dont stand a chance. Now as soon as we launch we 
<br />
<br />are heading to dead space were the rouges will have the ships good to go along with there 
<br />
<br />small shipyard.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to hit em fast n hard&quot; Erick cut in &quot;Now the attack force will comprise of three 
<br />
<br />wings. Blue wing, Red wing and Green wing. I will lead blue wing. Rory Venderson will lead 
<br />
<br />Red wing and Dev here will lead Green wing. Green wing will attack the weapon ship as Blue 
<br />
<br />and red wings take out the fighters and base. Any questions?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir&quot; a Pilot asked &quot;Will the fighters be modified in any way?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nope&quot; Dev said &quot;I expect that they will be standard dagger fighters. Now i got us all sabre 
<br />
<br />fighters. There should not be a problem.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;All hands to your ships&quot; Erick yelled &quot;We will meet in space. And pilots remeber today we 
<br />
<br />save liberty!&quot;
<br />
<br />All the pilots stood up and cheered. Rory ran to his ship and grabbed his helmet and put it on. 
<br />
<br />He jumped into the cockpit of his sabre.
<br />
<br />&quot;New ship smell...&quot; He mumbled. The ship slowly lifted off and he shot out the hangar.
<br />
<br />&quot;Red 1 checking in&quot; Rory said over the COM link
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Red 2 baby!&quot; a pilot yelled &quot;Ready n waiting to kick some ass!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Red 3 my man, moving out&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Red 4 checking in&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Red 5 here, Guns are loaded engines powered.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Red 6 ready to role.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Blue 1&quot; Rory said Joyfully &quot;Lets get this party started&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that Red 1&quot; Erick said &quot;All fighters get with your wings and move out!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehah!&quot; Dev yelled &quot;Moooooooooovin out! All the rest of ya 
<br />
<br />maggots fall in!&quot;
