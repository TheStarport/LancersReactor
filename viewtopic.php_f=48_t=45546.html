			<div class="content">Greetings fellow Lancers. My (nick)name is Fsmxi and I'm wanting to make a mod for some time now, yet I can't do this on my own. Before you start applying for the position of modder in this mod, read this message. It will tell you about the basics of this mod. As some of you might know, in the beginning there were 8(!!!) sleeperships meant to launch. Due to unknown reasons, only 5 sleeperships were launched to the sirius sector (wich actually just is a star, Sirius a). Those Sleeperships were the the Liberty, the Kusari, the Bretonnia, the Rheinland and the Hispania. But what happened to the other 3 sleeper ships? We don't know, and there has been some speculation on the forums about them. This mod is a total conversion for Freelancer. This mod will pursue the theory of that those 3 sleeperships were sent to another star. This will mean that there will be a whole new universe to explore. What it also means is loads of brand new weapons, ships, different factions; Liberty Navy, Corsairs, Ageira Technologies etc. just don't exist there! For this I want to have team of at least 4 modders. What I am looking for in modders is at least knowing how to handle Freelancer Explorer for basic system making and at least a bit knowledge about 1 or more of the following:
<br />-Faction making
<br />-Commodity Making
<br />-Ship Making/modelling
<br />-Advanced Universe Making (without FE, placing things on the z axis etc.)
<br />-Weapons/thrusters etc. making
<br />
<br />Now I am not a great modder myself, I can work with FE, but that doesn't make me a good modder. I can do basic weapons making etc. but I really don't know how to make ships, commodities or factions. (tough I think I can learn that quick) My real problem lies in the moddeling of ships. I can always easily draw a sketch of a ship, but I really don't have the real skills to modell, nor the real time to do it.
<br />
<br />A bit more information about the mod itself now.
<br />The 3 sleeperships will be of the following origin: French, Dutch and Australian. Their destination wasn't Sirius, but Antares, a star in the Scorpius Constellation, 600 lightyears from sol.
<br />Also, The weapons armament of these people will be far more projectile based, instead of the Sirius mostly laser/tachyon/plasma based. This due to the rich amount of materials that were found here, and some new materials that was unknown to both Sol and Sirius, giving acces to more powerful missiles, mines and torpedoes, yet weaker energy based weapons.
<br />The systems will be partly based on real systems, especially stars, but planets etc. are just needed to be insterted, because of the rareness of (habitable) planets we know of. 
<br />
<br />2 more requirements are:
<br />The ability to write/speak at least basic English
<br />The access to MSN (My msn is not the email to send the request for joining for)
<br />And at last, a few examples of what the mod might contain. These examples are a Torpedo, a Mine and a Thruster
<br />
<br />Nova Torpedo
<br />Hull Damage: 550
<br />Shield Damage: 350
<br />Range: 1500 m
<br />Refire rate: 2.6 seconds
<br />Explosion range: 750m
<br />Weapons speed: 40m/s (So, it will take 37.5 seconds to travel its&#8217; maximum range at 40m/s)
<br />Infocard
<br />The nova torpedo is a torpedo more meant for disruption among enemy ranks than the usual objective of torpedoes, destroying bases or capitalshps. The Nova Torpedo hase a medium torpedo range, relative fast speed, low damage but one of the greater explosion ranges. The Nova Torpedo was developed because piracy increased a lot the last decades, and pirate raiding parties increased in size as well. The Nova Torpedo is a great torpedo if you&#8217;re often outnumbered or if you just need to make chaos with large explosions.
<br />
<br />Beta Hydrogen Mine
<br />Hull damage: 5800
<br />Shield Damage: 5000
<br />Movement speed: 0m/s
<br />Refire rate: 1 second
<br />Explosion range: 40m
<br />Lifetime: 25 seconds
<br />Infocard
<br />The Hydrogen mine is a small nuclear device commonly used by pirates for it&#8217;s great damage and ability to set traps in areas with decrease sensors and visual range, as dark matter clouds. Unlike its&#8217; Alpha Twin brother, the Beta Hydrogen mine lacks an engine, but has larger and thus more powerful warhead. The &lt;one of the 3 sleepership houses&gt; has declared nuclear weapons contraband, so be careful with nukes there!
<br />
<br />Superthruster
<br />Top speed: 325 (thrusters only)
<br />Thruster drain: 600-900
<br />Infocard
<br />This thrusters was found in the wreck of the pirate ship &#8216;Fraterit&#233;&#8217;. It is a costumised thrusters, but not a single weapons dealer wants to give money for it, claiming that it&#8217;s a useless thing, give quick boosts for a short time.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />A few Final Notes
<br />Also, I don't have a site nor forums yet, because I was thinking that the main communications would go over msn (at least in the beginning). If a majority of the modders doesn't like this, I'll make a site and/or forums for communication. Further, I don't want to be like some sort of dictator leader, but I want everyone to have a voice in this mod that will be listened  to, altough the basic idea (listed above) will stay more or less the same. (nations may change, star may change etc.)
