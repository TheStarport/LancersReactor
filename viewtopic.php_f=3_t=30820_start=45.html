			<div class="content">Just as an off the wall thought, Why not add an abillity to salvage whole wrecks as an extra job?
<br />IE: Running a Wreking yard/Scrap Merchant Buisness.
<br />
<br />Even a MMRPG style system for online play could be worth a thought, and having an abillity for Players to submit Custom Charicter Models that they can either have exclusively, or make avalable for others to use, to a central distribution server that would spread it to the other Dedicated Servers, when/if that player uses that server, would be usefull.

			<h3><a href="#p293369" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">In Multi player games the server should be able to detect when a player attacks another player of a non hostile faction and if he kills them they should get taged red  to all other players as a murderer and a bounty placed on his head . the more kills the higher the bounty gets . the player should stay red until he is dead or his arrested . players should be lootable and when u die or eject u should loose your ship even if it means starting again . if u dont have a ship or the money to buy a new 1 there should be mission vendors that give u a ship to do the missions with as a matter of fact it probly the best way to start the game  .Oh and if u fail there missons or loose there ship thay should be pissed off with u [eg;if a navy pilot kills a civilian who is not hostile he is a murderer
<br />and should be treated as 1
<br />
<br />In sp game you should have to find the story line not have it rammed down your throat ;' 
<br />
<br />Have battleships and cruisers BUT you should have to earn one by joining a faction like the navy and working your way through the ranks .  The higher you get the bigger and better the ship u can have . As i realy dont beleive the the US navy whould sell me a Tomcat or f16 let alone a carrier . I also beleave that the navy and police would have better equipment than the average Joe Blow freelancer as i have never seen a ten tank pile up on the freeway hehe.You should still earn money for doing the missons for when u retire or to buy the ships once u have the point to do so. In planet side u get battle ranks that allow u to use them on certificates that allow u to drive a tank or fly a fighter or so on.
<br /> or both { not at the same time hehe}
<br />
<br />I also think that if u wish to fly a sabre or pirate ship u should be a pirate . If i see pirate ship heading towards me id think u were a little suspect as you either stole it or in fact a pirate .The same should apply to transports {eg. join gatewat fly gateway taged ecort fighters or transports . civilian ships should be friendy to all factions to allow u to carry civilian passagers or be a smuggler if u get caught smuggling u should be taged orange as a known smuggler to the police or navy faction so in mp games players who join police factions or navy factions can see and scan your cargo once again u taged only until u die or get arrested or join a hostile faction
<br />
<br />If u choose to leave a fraction u shouldnt lose the cert points as corperations are always looking for good exnavy pilots to work for them but not in battleships hehe .The points can only  be used  on the ships that the faction u join has has. 
<br />Join the bounty hunters same deal . 
<br />
<br />So that people understand wot i mean
<br />Murderer is someone who kills for fun not so much for gain
<br />Pirates are theifs and attack corperation for profit
<br />Smugglers are petty criminals trying to make a fast buck
<br />Civilian good hard working Joe trying to feed his family and make end meet
<br />Corperations well Bill Gates hehe well all know what they do.
<br />
<br />AT the end of the day u choose your path and as in real life freelancers are limited to wot they can and cant do
<br />
<br />And PLEASE no trade lane gates thay suck and are ugle and a pain in the but.
<br />
<br />Hope u guys like my ideas if not its all good and thanks for taking the time to read them

			<div class="content">Hi guys 
<br />im writing this in reply to tommy_4_life post on page 1
<br />Im new to this forum but i have played all the wing commander games privateer 1and 2 I have also played elite - first encounters, battlecruiser 3000ad and last but not least earth and beyond . and the first thing i like in a space game is the flying and i agree that the trade lanes suck, there ugly and a pain in the butt
<br />But privateer 2 may have been ok single player game but it wasnt free space and in a multi player game if u got caught in a system with a guy with a **** hot ship u have no chance of of geting out of there a live . I mean no disrespect when i say this but in multi player game sometime running is your only hope .Iv also played Ultima online and planet side and many other pvp games and have found that the thrill of the chase is often more fun then the kill
<br />
<br />And this one is for Saber 
<br />If Microsoft got it right in the first place we would need modders who by the way have done some great things will freelancer things Microsoft should have got right in the first place . I waited 5 years for freelancer to come out and was very disapointed when it did come out the game never lived up to the hype .It was suposed to be a massive multi player game but that dint happen.they should have called it bounty hunter cos there the only missions u can get . I had my copy of the game shiped from the USA and pre ordered it 1 year in advance . There was realy no point pvping in multi player cos u didnt even get a thing for taking someone out .Alot of my friends who where interested in playing fl went to play other pvp games and games like earth and beyond . Once again i mean no disrespect to u when i say this BUT if want to make money give us the buyers wot we want and my friend will play there friend will play and there friend will play and it may not work but we have to try</div>

<br />The reason earth and beyond failed is simple they promised pvp but then change it so u could only pvp in an areana and made the progens too strong for people too pvp i know this cos i was a founders federation dood [beta tester player and at first it was good fighting was based on the chars skill not so much your skill .
<br />so u dint have to be a top gun pilot you just neened a better char .
<br />Alot off people made chars wich took quite some time to do to find them selfs lacking when it came to pvp so they went with role playing and losed a lot of players .Alot of USA service man also played it too but the way the world was at the time and still is they had somthing much more important to do.And they are replacing it with some new form of Utima online OR so the email said it also said someting about free down load of the new game to EB players 
<br />
<br />Multi player games  and pvp game are the way the world is going  and yes id love a new story line but no npc can give   you  the same challenge or be as  unpredicable as real life people can so u should try it . Im a pirate on most servers im on some people love and some hate me but i give the poor freelancer  who has every thing someone to chase and i have chars on many servers but cant always get on them because they dont suport enough people and if it cost me each month to have the game i love then so be it because thats wot it might take to do so 
<br />
<br />Dont get me wrong i dont mean to upset anyone and it wouldnt be that hard for microsoft to make some addons for freelancer single player games .
<br />On battlefield you may at the best have about 60 people on a server 30 each team and half of them arnt trying to win the map there to busy shooting there own team mate in the back so they can have the plane or they blow it up
<br />On Planetside you can have close to 100 to 200 people all working for the sam corse and with that many people trying to stop u .And it pay to play and it leaves battlefeild for dead .There server are in the USA and Uk and live in Australia and i dont have dsl or cable but still get my share of kills .Have a look for your self at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.planetside">www.planetside</a><!-- w --> .com 
<br />
<br />Single player is easy you die u dont lose anything u dont loss cargo in multi player on the other hand when u die u lose every thing in your cargo bay and sometime your every credit u have is in your cargo bay . If u like single player that fine its realy your choise . If they did bring out some addon storyline wot do u do when there all done your right back where you started bored lonely and no one to talk to . 
<br />
<br />when i get bored i snot someone and they will chase me across the universe and sometimes they have 3 or 4 friend helping them .they try to block jump gate and jump hole to try and stop me they sometimes get me and sometime they dont and sometime i die cos I laugh so hard i cant see for the tears .
<br />
<br />that wat i call fun hehehe
<br />
<br />By the way MUSTANG I do agree with the ideas in your post

			<h3><a href="#p294143" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Just three things for now: 
<br />
<br />1. Systems based damage. I admit it, I like to blow apart my enemies one piece at a time, and I also like to be rewarded for precision. Instead of prioritizing a health bar with some destructability, damage to individual systems should be prioritized, with a little carry over to other appropriate systems. (ie. You disable or destroy a weapon or thruster, there is some overload damage to the engine core, but if you  blow off a wing, and there is minimal damage to other more vital sections of the hull, thus only a drop in manoeuverability.)
<br />
<br />2. Freelancer alluded to a huge potential plot point - the deterioration of Rheinland. To me, it didn't seem like  it was falling apart at the seams; the seams were already fissures.  
<br />
<br />The plot would revolve around Jochen Wiedemann, one of the two pilots who defected from Rheinland during the Nomad invasion. Three to eleven years after the original Freelancer, he has stayed in Bretonia, doing freelance work. Finally he gets a full job with Planetform fending off the Gaians around Planet Harris, and later is offered a lucrative deal (and a better ship than  the standard issue startracker) to fly for the Atka (sp?) Project in Hudson. En route, the convoy he was escorting is nearly destroyed by the Xenos from their nearby base, and the Evil Boss in charge of Jochen's division forces him to stick with the Startracker.
<br />
<br />Game begins, and after some local work, and maybe a foray or two into the settled Libery systems, Jochen gets word that  something big is going down in Rheinland, which at the time the game starts is currently incarnated as the Rheinland Corporation. ( In an effort to survive the onslaught of the Corsairs described in &quot; The Road to Rheinland &quot;, ALG Waste Disposal and Republican shipping merged with the Rheinland government in a desperate ploy to prevent the complete collapse of the House. )
<br />
<br />You should get to see some of the characters from the original game, like all of the other Rheinlanders. The Nomad/Dom Kavash arc should be left until the next sequel, but with a a few events  in Freelancer 2 that turn out to be important later on. If Trent and Juni appear, it should be only briefly, with hush hush circumstances to heighten the intrigue for the next game.
<br />
<br />3. While I generally not one to detract from others ideas, I must say that the notion of turning the Hispania factions into a legitimate House amounts to a romanticization, and would detract from some of the best harsh realities of the Sirius Sector. Sorry.</div>

			<div class="content">I think that it should have better NPC. More to the story line the way it ended makes it sound like its not over. Better ships and weps i think they should add star trek and star wars ships in it. Think they should make trent look cooler he looks like an idiot in the game. Juni and trent should fall in love too. Also no mods!!!! mods are dump they dont make it any better. Well those are my suggestions hope u like them.

			<div class="content">B22. Fuel for flight (Either just for turbo or both turbo and regular flight)
<br />
<br />i don't really agree with that
<br />I have an idea, since in Freelancer1 clans were made just by aadding some initials to the name here should be different
<br />so here's my idea (only in MP):
<br />To be able to create a clan you should have lvl 70 or more, and then you must travel throw pirate &amp; nomads system then when you get to the system were you create the clan you need to help a planet from the nomad battleships, nomad invasions, and then the planet faction leaves you to dock and when you get onboard you talk to someone in bar and you must pay him 10,000,000 credits to be able to create the clan, the next step is making the clan logo, it should be a small thing, like a chess table with 64 points, and you need to color those representing the clan logo wich will appear on the ship... 
<br />on every player wich is in the clan and wich will join will have the clan logo on his ship, and who will leave the clan will not have the logo on his ship anymore
<br />next step you need to chose were the logo should be placed on, left wing, right wing, middle wing, both wings, etc.
<br />in the next step you need to choose the clan's name, and the clans initials
<br />after that you must choose a clans ranking system and each ranks initials, as for example:
<br />1st rank: Helper {H}
<br />2nd rank: Experianced pilot {EP}
<br />3rd rank: Pilot {P}
<br />4th: Rookie Pilot {RP}
<br />after this you must choose how your clan members will get better ranks, by geting it from you or people you thrust, high ranks who have the ability to promote players or by killing NPC's, or by number of players killed (for pirate clans)...
<br />after this you must decide at how many stars a high level can promote players and at how many stars a high level can recruit someone who wants to join the clan (5 star's max, these can be given only by the clan leader);
<br />only 1 player in the clan can have 5 stars (thats you); and 3 clan mates with 4 stars, 7 with 3 and unlimited with 2, 1.
<br />as for example if you set at 3 stars a high lvl can recruit and promote, than every high ranks can promote and recruit(PS: only high ranks can get stars)
<br />if you set at 0 stars you can recruit, than anyone can recruit, if you set at 3 stars to recruit and at 5 to promote, then a 3 star can recuit but cannot promote, etc.
<br />after this you need to group the ranks, high ranks, medium ranks, low ranks and just joined ranks.
<br />and only the high ranks can get stars...
<br />in the next step you need to set your situation with other clans that are registered on that server, like in factions, for start you can put them all neutral, and you can just change later
<br />each time a new clan is made it will appear in your clan relations menue <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />after all these you must set a clan's home system, a clan's main hideout (it should not be showed in player's menue), a clan's base.
<br />in the next and almost last step you can buy some stations if you have enough credits, each planet costs different, by it's advantages and disavantages... stations cost less, you can order some plaftforms at the entrance of your system, wich will work with the local faction's platforms.
<br />then the last step you chose what kinda clan: pirate, trader, police, hunter, etc.
<br />after this you have your clan, the name of the clan will be near your name, it is visible only in space, like at the faction, if you are in a faction too, then it is added that tag too, for example:
<br />Navy - [Clan Player
<br />the name &quot;Player&quot; is in a clan called &quot;Clan&quot; and in the Liberty Navy faction.
<br />to join the clan you must type /clan Clan Leader name and if he wants you in he accepts or he denies...
<br />the clan leader can open war's just in the clan's menue (like when there is a faction menue).
<br />
<br />erm, this is just an idea <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />Manual landing/docking
<br />It means, while landing, you have to keep a specific angle, like real SpaceCraft landings
<br />(perhaps with tutorial or automatic correction at the beginning)
<br />
<br />Then, when landed/docked, the game should turn like a small FPS, where you get up youself from your seat, go to your ship's trap, and U go yourself through stations tubes, or the different halls of a planet base.
<br />
<br />And, if you don't push your automatic distant centralized ship locking while docked, some robbers cans steal it from you <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />(&quot;Damm, where my ship'd gone?? Crap, I hadn't locked before going to drunk myself at the bar&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />More: more you stay in a bar, the more the drinks and the smoke will make you disese, and make a smooth moove when handling yous ship after that, flue vision ect)

<br />-Ejecting: if you get shot up and your ship is dying you can punch out.  But enemies can pick you up and kill you or take you prisoner.  If you are a prisoner you can try to escape and take the ship you are being held on a station you can try to hijack a ship.

			<div class="content">I read a couple pages of ths, skimmed the rest Im afraid, but it occurs to me that FL2 may not be all that hard. Okay, Im not a coder so am probably talking out of my bum, but it seems that if you combined elements of some of the mods you could achieve all of the above effects (buying battleships, new ships, proper scale ect are the ones I noticed).
<br />
<br />And as for the SP game, well, Barking Dog studios did something like this when they made Homeworld Cataclysm, they kept large chunks of the original game, ships, story background ect, but they added to it, improved it, and created a whole new SP campeign, with aspects that made it into the 'official' HW2.
<br />Creating a new executable would allow several other things, probably including skins, customisable ships ect ect, as well as the new storyline.
<br />
<br />If some of the modders got together and put some energy into that, (and less into cheating on V1.0 servers) then a FL2 could be created entirly by fans, for free, or a small fee.
<br />
<br />As i said, im not a coder, ut MOST of the stuff could be done with existing mods, and some fudging, and the EXE... well, i dont know, someone correct me please <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
