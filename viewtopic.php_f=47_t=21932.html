			<div class="content">OK, thought I'd start this thread (Hope you dont' mind Wizard. If you do just wipe this thread.) to keep all the little niggling questions out of the story thread. Its really annoying to be reading the story punctuated by questions. Like can this happen can that happen etc.
<br />Also, I tried (I'm sure others did) to post their characters background after the thread was locked. So here's mine. I wrote it in New York as a background, but I'll adapt as Wizard writes me into his story...
<br />
<br />Lutz &quot;Widowmaker&quot; Walsh, life alignment= Lawful good, changed in story to Neutral, Neutral (Zoner type thing going on, all will be explained)
<br />Current Location: Brushal Base, Frankfurt.
<br />
<br />Lutz started out at the age of 18 in the Liberty Police, working first on the patrol duty around Manhattan, then after a daring raid on a Liberty Rogue smuggling ring he was promoted, gained his own wing of ships and was sent to patrol around Zone-21. It was also where he earned his nickname, WidowMaker after he destroyed 8 veteran Rogues, 2 on the most wanted list, in what remained of his heavily damaged Defender. Within a year at Zone-21 he was offered a role within the Navy as a patrol leader within the Alaska system. Lutz accepted, was sworn into the Navy, was sworn to uphold all Liberty justice and to not tell souls of what he knew and/or saw out in Alaska (Basically an oath of silence that spies and whatnot take)
<br />At 22 he was one of the youngest to reach is relatively high rank in the history of the Navy. 
<br />At the age of 20 he meet a girl called Alys (Any spots the name links, they get a prize! <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) whom he fell in love with. And at 23 years old Alys and Lutz tied the knot. Many happy years were upon them as they worked away, Alys a commodity trader on Manhattan, Lutz working in the Alaska system.
<br />His keen flying skills and almost intuitive sense of danger brought him to the attention of the Navy once more; at 26 he was offered something that he never expected, test flying. He piloted new ships that came off the drawing boards, new weapons that were developed were tested by him. He lead three ships against a Xeno supply depot and they wiped it out, out numbered almost 4:1. Lutz career looked fine. Until 3 weeks ago.
<br />Lutz was out by Ouray Base, chasing down a Xeno transporter carrying large quantities of uranium, rumours had been abound for a long time that the Xenos were attempting to develop a weapon capable off shutting a jump gate permanently. His chief superior, one Andy Smith, had personally flown the sortie against it, flying the latest technology that was fresh out of Alaska, the Defender-xs, also known as the Sentinel. 3 Sentinels made up the wing; Andy, Lutz and a old veteran called Togi. The transporter had almost made it to dock, and Andy and Togi were being hard pressed by Xeno ships, only Lutz had the chance to take out the transporter. With the transporter shields down, he powered up the new particle disruptor which would take it down in one shot. As he fired though, the whole coolant system backfired, fusing the weapon, rendering it useless. The transporter had made it, Lutz had failed. The three Sentinels quickly made their escape.
<br />Upon their return to Alaska Andy Smith placed the blame firmly on the shoulders of Lutz. And as word reached them 3 days later of a nuclear blast in the Silverton Asteroid Field, he was court marshalled, stripped of rank, and was sent away in disgust at his failure. He was accused of not reading the specifications about the use of the particle disruptor and negligence in his role as an officer. The fact that scientists later scrapped the idea was never raised by the Navy officials. Knowing all the information that he did the Navy imprisoned Lutz in the Alaskan prison station. His appeal was denied, no contact was allowed back home to friends and family.
<br />On route the transporter taking him to his fate was sabotaged from the inside by a Liberty Rogue leader. The man had a chemical injected into his body, and when mixed with pure water (And that was the only drink prisoners got to help lower disease rates) it mixed and exploded with extreme force. The prison ship was stranded just outside of port, and was quickly towed back to dock. The entire ships internal defences to hold prisoners had been compromised, and when it docked all hell broke loose. Lutz's only thoughts were escape. He almost made it to the hanger containing the Defender-xs, when Togi caught up with him. Lutz couldn't kill his friend, who had stood up for him in the trial, and agreed to come along quietly. All would have been different had Togi not been shot by three rogues who had the same idea as Lutz. One was taken out by Togi, the other two grabbed Lutz and forced him to the Sentinels. Strapped in they blasted their way out of dock, the computers were tapped into by the rogues, and they escaped Alaska. They went past the police as if nothing was happening and then fled. Lutz broke off for Manhattan. He managed a mere hour with Alys before his name was flashed up by the police on the local news. Declared an outlaw he had no choice but to flee, leaving Alys behind. Jump hole after jump hole and he finally found a place to accept him, Brushal base. There he currently is, pondering his future,  stuck with a top of the range ship with a broken proto-type weapon, a destroyed life, a marriage he cannot have and a destiny he cannot control.
<br />
<br />
<br />If it wasn't for the inky blackness of the night you wouldn't appreciate the brilliance of the stars...

			<div class="content">ok, I think anyone will. Just as long as we keep track of eachother, and use eachothers systems/factions/bases/inventions/techs/comodities/etc
<br />Then I guess it's allright.
<br />It would've been easier to keep it restricted to Sirius, because you allready have those things set. and making up a few wuold be much easier.
<br />Like accidently discouvering a new jumphole that leads to a new system in the borderworlds or something.

			<h3><a href="#p180216" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Born to Sagara Takeshi and Hasegawa Ryoko, Seki and younger brother Shiro entered service together into the Kusari Naval Forces (Seki was 23 and Shiro was 18 at the time).  After requesting to be assigned to a light attack squadron together, they spent the next 3 years performing routine border patrols along the Kusari-Rheinland border (via the Sigma-19 Jump Point), mock training battles, and the occasional arresting or destruction of pirate vessels.  On one such occasion, Seki downed a heavy Corsair fighter (Centurion class) that had left as salvage a Tizona del Cid pulse cannon.  Shiro also managed to shoot down the renegade bounty hunter that was engaging the Corsair.  The bounty hunter had had a &amp;#8220;Wild Fire&amp;#8221; prototype cannon in its hold, and when the ship was destroyed, the cargo just became floating debris.  With their new found weapons, Seki and Shiro spent considerable time harassing the techs to come up with a make-shift mount for the over-powered weapons, and in a few days they each had a special cannon mounted to the underside of the nose of their Drake class patrol vessels.
<br />
<br />During the 8th year of their naval career, though, they discovered a luxury cruise liner in the Honshu system carrying 4,000 luxury guests and a cargo of luggage, light and heavy weapons (for ground use as well as several ship mounted weapons), and various pieces of contraband (alien artifacts, life-forms, slaves, etc&amp;#8230<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.  It had been rumoured that there was a rogue force within Kusari space, supplied by the Bundschuh, that had been causing massive riots in which entire neighborhoods had been burned to the ground.  One of those neighborhoods was where Seki and Shiro&amp;#8217;s parents lived.  That was 2 years ago&amp;#8230;their parents had died in the flames of that uprising.  After attempting to hail the vessel several times, Seki fired his non-lethal Tizona del Cid and collapsed the shields of the luxury liner.  Unfortunately, because of the jerry-rigged nature of the mount, it overloaded his systems and disabled his ship.  Fearing for their lives, the captain of the cruise liner admitted to being a trafficker for the Bundschuh and that they were en route to the Hokkaido system to transfer their goods to a rebel envoy&amp;#8230;the captain was surrendering his ship.  Seeing the people responsible for his parents&amp;#8217; deaths, Shiro, filled with rage at his loss, plunged his ship at the cruise liner, firing all his weapons.  When his barrage burned away several layers of armor from the vessel&amp;#8217;s hull, Shiro fired his salvaged &amp;#8220;Wild Fire&amp;#8221; cannon and watched as it set off a chain reaction of explosions (it would later be theorized that the &amp;#8220;Wild Fire&amp;#8221; had caused massive damage to one of the cruise liner&amp;#8217;s reactors, causing it to rupture and detonating the entire engine room).  Upon their return to their carrier, Shiro was awarded a medal of commendation for meritoriously serving the Kusari Empire and stopping the shipment of weapons to the renegade Kusarians.  Disgusted by his brother&amp;#8217;s elation at that celebration of butchery, Seki became disillusioned with the Kusari government and began to see the many injustices the military, police, and government officials were wreaking on their own people.  Seeing this, Seki fled Kusari space (his visions of a better future for the people of the Kusari Empire were seen to be antagonistic to the Kusari government).  Shiro was too indoctrinated into the ideal of &amp;#8220;honor for the empire&amp;#8221; that when the time came for him to choose either the empire or his people, he chose service to the empire first.  Now, Seki is loosely affiliated with the Bundschuh, for even though they indirectly caused his parents&amp;#8217; deaths, he could never forgive the Kusari Empire for the suffering it had been causing its own people.</div>

			<div class="content">Personal History: Andrew is an Italian by heart. There were plenty of fully Italian New Yorkers on the Liberty when it launched, and they stuck together after planetfall on Manhattan. He is a product of Little Italy sector. He started out as a Navy officer until.....well....nothing happened, he just quit and deserted with his Defender. He wandered around throughout Texas until he discovered that there was a small bounty on his head. A simple Bring back alive for Desertion and Theft. He was ambushed by some Amatuer Bounty Hunters and defeated them all. Quick and Painless. So Painless that three days later the Bounty Hunters were rescued. Andrew had only disabled their ships and ran off. Impressed by this, the Lane Hackers took him in(Also because the Hackers were Being hunted and the bounty on Arrigoni distracted them). This made him an instant enemy of the Xenos. At Mactan he met his next ship. A Lane Hacker pilot had recently died of a Cardimine overdose and left his fully equipped Dagger behind. After awhile he was a full fledged Lane Hacker thug. Thankfully, nobody knew and he was still good in most of Liberty. He made a few bribes that took the navy and most of the Bounty Hunters off his back. The leader of the Bounty Hunters he disabled was still after him and defeated Arrigoni after a lengthy one on one dogfight. The Dagger was very badly damaged, and Andrew had to eject. Since there was no bounty anymore, the Hunter left him for dead. His old Hacker allies found him and brought him back to Mactan. This is where he discovered his true injuries. Broken arms, mangled hands. One of his hands had to be replaced with a mechanical one jerry rigged off a fried robot.
<br />
<br />At this point he was no longer able to fight and bought a hand-me-down Dromedary, the Not Quite so rusty &quot;Rusty Camel&quot;. This is about when he began his travels. Trough Bretonia, Kusari, and finally out into the Edge Worlds. He got onto the Not-so-bad side of the Outcasts and was allowed access to Malta. He stayed on Malta for about a month, managing not to take Cardimine. A damn good miracle. He began his exodus and became good friends with the Zoners, eventually becoming one himself. Soon landed at the Samura base on Kurile. Stayed there for nearly a year without ever touching his ship. The Camel was quite rusty at his point. This is about when he made his way back home. Manhattan. He was in orbit when the Donau was destroyed by an Order attack group. He stayed in the back awaiting the end of the battle so he could scavenge before the Junkers showed up. He was on the way to Rochester anyway. He snatched up what he could and completed his &quot;Cargo&quot; Run to Rochester and proceeded to Detroit. Took him a few days because he got lost, but he made it. Grabbed some guns from Detroit, wandred to the California gate and made it through the outer systems again, barely missing the The Rheinland fleet making its way to Kusari. He's been at Freeport 9 ever since. He has started a Guide business and is awaiting customers.
<br />
<br />I know it references to events in FL. But Screw it. It doesn't really matter, I just added that stuff for effect, to show how history just passed the guy by without even stopping to say hello.

			<div class="content">I managed to email to wiz my profile. I'm not sure what he has in mind for my character, but maybe I'll explain the modification to his Dragon.
<br />
<br />As Daniel's father is a high level employee in Kishiro Technologies, he had access to some of their more leading-edge technology. One of those was an advanced civilian-class neuralnet access device for ships. It allowed for multiple layers of displays on the Heads Up Navigation system, or HUD. In addition to enhanced display, input controls were designed to make it easier to do more. With the advanced neuralnet, it is possible to independently control weapons aim from ship movement. Accessing information from the neuralnet database and displaying it on one of the HUD layers is so natural and subtle, that it borders on the line of reading one's thoughts as to what one wants to display. Obviously in the heat of combat this is very important, as fumbling around controls could mean the difference between life and death. In addition, the neuralnet holds much more control over ship maneuvering, and can greatly help a pilot during and outside of combat. Outside of combat, there are improvements such as automatically going between waypoints, and automatically dropping countermeasures. During combat, it helps a pilot to seem like his skills are more than the skills actually are. It regulates power management between weapons, engines, and shields very effectively, can help with targetting, can adjust to seemingly increase a pilot's reaction time, and more.
<br />
<br />Daniel's mother is an employee of Ageria. Thus, she has access to the Universal Ship Identification (USI) system used in tradelanes and jumpgates. The USI software allows Ageria and Interspace Commerce (IC) to effectively manage convoys travelling through the civilized worlds. IC uses it to adjust insurance rates based on cargo holds. It may be considered by some to be a breach of privacy, but it allows the tradelanes to be much safer against attacks by conventional pirates. The obvious exception to this are the Lane Hackers. They have cracked the USI software and are able to pick only the most valuable shipments clean off the tradelanes.
<br />
<br />Daniel's ship is equipped to access trade lane USI software, but he is able to use it for good. Aside from information on passing shipments, the software is able to check the status on tradelane rings - effectively able to tell if pirates have disrupted the tradelane, and where they have. In addition, it can access the individual tradelane's targetting scanners and tell the profile and number of pirates at a particular tradelane disruption. He has used this information when escorting convoys to get the transports he was escorting to drop out of the tradelane ahead of the planned ambush point, and waiting until the tradelane ring is back online.
<br />
<br />Currently, the software is read-only, and cannot gain control of a tradelane ring - be it targetting software or the actual transportation itself.
<br />
<br />(OOC: The topic <i>says </i> &quot;Techy bits&quot;... <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />----------
<br />I'm thinking of redoing Daniel's profile a tad, if it's okay with you, wiz. No real changes, just some add-ons and to fix up a few things (Now that it's morning and I can think :p). I suppose I should post it here for others to read, but if you don't want me to, then that's okay.
<br />----------
<br />Note: In the following, I've italicized parts which were not in the orginal email to wizard.
<br />
<br />Daniel &quot;Psawhn&quot; Morlone
<br />
<br />Customized J10P-15P &quot;Dragon&quot; Kusari Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br /><i>Ship name: Seer </i>
<br />
<br /> Daniel Morlone's mother was an employee in Ageria, and his father was a high level employee of Kishiro, so obviously he was constantly exposed to high technology during his youth no matter which of his separated parents he was currently staying with. He is intelligent, able to do wonders with the insides of his ship. Through his father's connection, he had managed to gain access to an older model of the Dragon. He and his father worked on upgrading it with numerous small tweaks - just enough to barely improve efficiency. The largest change, however, is a incredible neuralnet interface.
<br />While on a business trip, Daniel's father was killed by Xenos. Obviously he enraged them, so he moved to Liberty to gain some revenge.
<br />His mother, being a charitably soul, gave him some basic Ageria USI codes - which he promised he'd always use to protect shipping convoys. This makes a very good combination with his advanced neuralnet.
<br />Aside from the neuralnet, there isn't much special about his Dragon. He has a balanced loadout (pulse weapons, tachyon weps, some looted xenos particle guns, and a missile launcher).
<br />
<br /><i>After his father's death, he devoted himself to protecting international convoys from the pirates that made his parent's life so hard. He dislikes Lane Hackers, Outcasts, and Rogues, in addition to the kusari pirates the Blood Dragons and Golden Chrysanthemums. He doesn't like Samura - and their puppets the Hogosha and Farmers Alliance - but remains on a neutral term with them. He harbours a special hatred for Xenos.
<br />
<br />He is an average pilot, which is surprising considering his lack of training in ships - the most he's ever had was for his pilot's license. However, combine him with his neuralnet, and he seems to be much more skilled than you'd believe. </i>
<br />
<br />Alignment: Lawful good. <i>(Yeah, blech, but I can't really think of much else. Maybe he can turn neutral or something during the story. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) </i>
<br />----------
<br />I think the above profile should somehow be inserted with the rest of the profiles in the profile topic.
<br />----------
<br />More on Daniel:
<br />
<br />In Daniel's youth, whenever he visited his father in Kusari, he had always admired the Kusari heavy fighter that the Kusari Navy flew. But he thought the only way he could get one was through enlistment in the Kusari Navy. However, for his 19th birthday, his father worked with his mother to buy a older model of the Dragon for him externally through the Freelance program. That was the only thing they did together in the past 16 years, and would be the last thing. Two years later, while Daniel's father was on a business trip his transport was brutally attacked and killed by Xeno radicals.
<br />
<br />Daniel never had any proper schooling, although he is very intelligent and was raised in a high technology surroundings. The constant shuffling back and forth between his parents was murder on his proper education, and as such never acheived very well. He does, however, know quite a lot about technical things, such as engineering and optronics. He knows quite a bit about how the insides of ships work. He can quite easily handle computing, and combined with his advanced neuralnet he can do wonders with his shipboard computer. He has no experience in hacking, however.
<br />
<br />Nowadays, he takes freelance jobs escorting convoys through the Independent Worlds surrounding Liberty. When he isn't actively escorting the convoys, he can take the odd navy or police job to patrol the tradelanes and protect other convoys. Because of his neuralnet modifications, he can locate and be at the site of a tradelane attack much faster than the police or navy, and has helped save some convoys from attack. He always has a place to stay at his mother's on Los Angeles, which is great for the occasional vacation.
<br />
<br />His ship's loadout has nothing special: A civilian pulse gun (Adv. stunpulse), a guided missile launcher (like the windstalker), two looted Xenos particle weapons, and a tachyon gun. With proper energy management his thruster and shields can be much more effective than normal. He has fine tuned the inside of his ship to be equivelant to a new line model, despite being much older.
<br />----------
<br />
<br />Ack! That's not just slightly in the FL universe, now, is it? :S I suppose it will have to do, however.
<br />
<br />And I have no idea where he is right now, actually... somewhere either in Liberty or the IW... if they exist in this universe :p.
<br />

<br />
<br />Wizard: Maybe you could put up a complete listing of characters in the story, and places that we can goto etc...?
<br />
<br />Whasp Commander: By &quot;Techy Bits&quot; I meant everything that in about the story that isnt' teh story. Everything to do with getting the story up and running, and a place to post questions about the story, and of course, techy bits for your ship. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />To Wizard: How do you guarantee a nice and clean, spam/wildpost free story?
<br />I sugest that all who want to enter a part to the story mail it to you, or anyone who preserves the struckture of the story. So that people don't 
<br />1. start to argue over what can, and what can not.
<br /><b>Well.. nobody's complaining... and that's why I closed the sign-in so that the group doesn't get to big </b>
<br />2. just come up with their own uber weapons, wich they made themselves. (same for ships/cloacks and all)
<br /><b> Most of the time we fight against allies and I determine the outcome (as being the GM) </b>
<br />3. go out and quickly post a kill, so their character survives. (Only one man should decide)
<br /><b>Yup, I (the GM) decides when someone dies (after discussing it with that certain person </b>
<br />4. contradict with other people (I mean, knocking someone out, while he himself is allready knocked out and such)
<br /><b>That's going to be the biggest problem. People who are writing should keep up with the story so they know what's going on. The cool thing is that we someone who is knocked over, and that immediatly Lutz posts a reply about how he takes cares of him.  </b>
<br />
<br />We can also start an entry thread, where people can sugest story developements and talk about it. 
<br />People can Introduce new chars and post their own part, to talk about with others before actually adding it to the story, or if we decide so, mail it to the storykeeper. 
<br /><b>You can always mail it to </b>
<br /><b>The fun part is: you never know what's going to happen. Ok, I have a red line in my head, but the biggest part of the story is made up by the writers </b>
<br />
<br />Maybe I, or anyone else can come up with more ideas.
<br />Someone needs to guide all of this. I can see this go wrong allready.
<br />Maybe we even need to start over. We can ofcourse use the first 3/4 entries.
<br />
<br />What do you think?
<br />
<br />
<br /><b> IMO we can just continue the story </b>

			<div class="content">Ah...now that I know what &quot;techy bits&quot; refers to I can post specs about ships and final character names.
<br />
<br />Name: Sagara Seki
<br />Ship: Drake (moderated modded.  See below)
<br />Ship Name: Tenshi (translated: heavenly warrior)
<br />Ship equipment:  Advanced Aegis shield (because of the large power drain of the shield, once it's down it stays down for 1-2 minutes, then begins to recharge...unless Seki uses all shield batts to get it back up), 2 Katana class guns, 2 Stealthblade MkI, and a Tizona del Cid (has a 70% probability of causing massive power failure to the firing ship...but will collapse and/or disable targetted ship), 23/23 nano/batts, and enhanced flight controls to make the ship even more maneuverable than what it was before.  Painted in blue and silver in an angelic fashion (silver wings, blue cockpit and upper fuselage, and silver bottom fuselage), and a Rheinland powerplant normally used in 'Stiletto' class heavy fighters.
<br />
<br />Name:  Sagara Shiro (final name change)
<br />Ship:  Drake (heavily modified)
<br />Ship Name:  Bakemono (translated: demon, or possessed by a demon)
<br />Ship equipment:  Bulwark shields, 2 Suncannon B class guns, 2 SkyBlast B, and a &quot;Wild Fire&quot; prototype cannon (can only fire once every 3 minutes).  Armor plating has been welded onto the Bakemono as to enhance its survivability in combat.  However, the plates are at odd angles, making the appearance of the Bakemono even more devilish.  Painted in red an black in a demonic appearance (the upper fuselage is red, lower fuselage black, with the wings striped, and the jagged edges of the armor plating painted red as blood).  He had cut a powerplant out of a 'Hammerhead' class Bounty Hunter using his Suncannons (while the pilot of the vessel was still alive) and had it engineered into his own ship, thus allowing a higher energy capacity for weapons.  All the better for him to serve his empire and defeat its enemies.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Forgot about the ballistic weapons.  Bakemono is equipped with a 'Hornet' class cruise disruptor and advanced CM.  Seki added a missile hardpoint to the area just above the cockpit on Tenshi.  Mounted there is a 'Paralyzer' missile launcher.  Sure, at just over 7k a shot, it's pricey...but when you REALLY want that ship disabled...
<br />
<br />--BTW: if you hadn't noticed yet, Seki prefers to take prisoners alive, whereas Shiro doesn't take prisoners.
