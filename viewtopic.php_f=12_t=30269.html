			<div class="content">&quot;Ok you guys lets settle down and do some planning, if we want to make sure that the FS is safe we will have to have a very good plan&quot; Eraser was in his element, he Zlo, SirSpectre and sycho_warrior were sitting in the bar on Planet Manhatten, having their first official OffTopic discussion.
<br />
<br />&quot;Eraser lets just get one thing straight, I am not a guy and I do not like it being generalized under guys. To get to the point of this meeting, I think a good idea would be to set up a general emergency channel, which is manned 24hours a day by us, that way we would know immediately id someone was attacked.&quot;sycho_warrior was at her best, or depending who you are on her worst 
<br />
<br />&quot;sw I am only going to say this once, we don't have time for pointless arguments, you know what they say, if you want to run with the big dogs, you have to accept it if you are treated like them. You chose to join the guys; we cannot make an exception for you every time, so either you accept it if I only say guys or you can leave. I know it is drastic measures, but as I already said we do not have time to waste.&quot; Eraser was never a person who liked being bothered by trival stuff and he clearly showed it
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, if the rest of us gets flushed down the loo, why shouldn&#8217;t it happen to you as well, you cant expect to always be treated different than the rest, you will just have to accept being treated the same as the guys.&quot; Zlo was still not over the humiliation of being saved/almost killed by a girl, his friends kept making jokes about it, it was almost worse than going somewhere without flushing the toilet!
<br />
<br />sw looked like she could explode at any moment, she just wanted to snap back at Zlo when Sir Spectre started speaking: &quot;If this is how this team is going to be, we can just as well drop it, you cannot go out in combat if you are angry at one of your team members. When you are out there you have to know that you can fully rely on your wingmen and you cannot know that if you and someone else are angry at each other.&quot; finished speaking Sir Spectre took off his glasses and started cleaning them (an operation which, if he did it thoroughly, took about 20 minutes)
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;I agree with SirS, sw you and Zlo will have to clear up your differences, otherwise we will loose the fight against evil.&quot; Eraser looked sternly at Zlo and sw who were fiddling and not looking him in the eyes. &quot;Lets continue on a civilized manner.&quot;
<br />
<br />Just then Freighter Fighter entered the bar and walked toward them. &quot;Hey guys, would you mind if I joined the OffTopic? This new evil faction has to be ruined before the ruin the FS.&quot;
<br />
<br />Eraser couldn't hide a happy smile: &quot;Sure thing, I'm Eraser, this is Zlo, Sir Spectre and sycho_warrior, pleased to meet you.&quot;
<br />
<br />Freighter Fighter smiled: &quot;What can I do?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;We were just discussing how things will work, sit down, you can help&#8221; Eraser was all businesslike again.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are you sure we should be talking here? You never know the evil side could have informers everywhere.&#8221; Butter could not melt in freighter fighter&#8217;s mouth.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Nah it will be fine, no traitor will ever dare to come near us&#8221; Zlo sounded extremely sure of himself.
<br />
<br />Despite that comment, everybody started to look around.
<br />
<br />                                                                                       *********
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />&#8220;I think it is time that we send those idiots of the FS a message&#8221; The Evil Thing was bored, he decided to wait for some information from freighter fighter before he staged another attack, but no he regretted that decision. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sure boss whatever you say&#8221;  ): Wolf Demon <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>   wasn&#8217;t in the mood to listen to TET sulk, he was busy playing with his wolfs, with all this evil side stuff, he didn&#8217;t get much time to do it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just sit still. I&#8217;m going to record my speech now and we don&#8217;t want them to see al our members do we&#8221;  With that words TET rearranged his hair and sat down  in front of the camera.
<br />
<br />                                                     ***************
<br />
<br />&#8220;Do not try to stop the Spammers, you will not succeed&#8221; Bargib switched of the screen when the speech had finished; most of the people who were at the previous meeting were there again. &#8220;Any comments?&#8221; he asked
<br />
<br />&#8220;He sure seems certain of himself and the rest of the spammers, but that&#8217;s usually what makes great people fail.&#8221; It was one of those rare occasions where Darkstone spoke, his philosophy, was that if you couldn&#8217;t say something useful you should shut up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s very true Darkstone, but I think an extremely important question, is how will we know who are spammers and who not, we cannot speak so freely about what we want to do if there is a chance that there is traitors between is.&#8221; As usual kimk was the one posing the important question.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You idiots isn&#8217;t it a bit late to think off that now. Looks like I should have been here from the beginning in stead of just following the events on the news&#8221;
<br />
<br />Everybody turned to stare at the stranger who just spoke, they could not believe his arrogance.
<br />
<br />&#8220;An who may you be?&#8221; Bargib clearly didn&#8217;t like being insulted in his own back yard.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am Spacenut, just so you guys know, I am a genius, and I sell ship equipment.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey genius does this look like a guy to you?&#8221; Zlo roughly pulled sw nearer by the arm &#8220;If you really were a genius you would have known that you NEVER refer to a lady as a guy, especially not this..err.err.lady&#8221;
<br />
<br />The  members of OffTopic were stunned and on the verge of bursting out in laughter, this was the last thing they expected from Zlo, he really had to be upset.
<br />
<br />                                                                            **********
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hi, can you guys maybe give me some directions? 
<br />
<br />TET was scared out of his wits when a guy started speaking behind him &#8220;What!!! How did you get in here?&#8221;
<br />TET was flabbergasted he had state of the art security systems(or thought he had) how on earth could this guy have gotten in?
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ehm I just&#8230; it would be too complicated for you to understand&#8221; The guy was reluctant to part with the information
<br />
<br />&#8220;Would you be able to do that with any system?&#8221; TET was getting interested now, a guy like this could be a good asset
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yea sure why not&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Hmm what line of work are you in?&#8221; If he could get this guy on his side, the OffTOpic would never beat them! An evil smile was playing on TET&#8217;s face.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I do any line of work, as long as the pay are good. By the way I&#8217;m Arania&#8221; Arania had a smug look on his face, he knew nobody who knew about his skills could resist hiring him.
<br />
<br />&#8216;OK first of all I am The Evil Thing, creator of the Spammers, if you don&#8217;t mind being on the bad side you are hired.&#8221;  
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m in, never say no to a chance to disrupt good order&#8221;
<br />
<br />                                                                                   **********

<br />As for zlo........ow well we'll see <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> but im thinking of writing sw out of the story, the temptation is too big to always let her look good and thats unfair toward the rest of the chars..........but we'll see what happens <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
