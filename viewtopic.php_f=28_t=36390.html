			<div class="content">After one bad release &lt;shudders&gt; and 5 hours of non-stop bug-stomping... Alpha 4 is finally ready to go.
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/Download/Download.asp?ID=1363' Target=_Blank>You can download it here.</a>
<br />
<br />Special Credit in this version goes to BP, for helping me resolve a last-second crisis, Anton, whose unstinting work on FLModel Tool has helped me to realize some of the current effects, and Louva-Deus and Parabolix for helping me with several technical issues.  Thanks, folks- I wouldn't have gotten done without you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Before I begin to describe the features of this Alpha, I'd like to once again make a plea to the FL community:
<br />
<br />1.  I need some modeling talent.
<br />
<br />2.  I need a sound artist.  Preferably one familiar with the RIFF format, who's interested in a challenging job.
<br />
<br />3.  I need a server op. to give this mod a try, so that there's somewhere to play the mod.
<br />
<br />Please, folks... if you have the resources/skills I need, help this mod reach its potential.
<br />
<br />This mod is Multiplayer ONLY.  If you're using the mod, then you need to open up FLServer and start a multiplayer game.  In Freelancer Mod Manager, click on the File menu, and then click &quot;start FLServer&quot;... the rest is pretty obvious.
<br />
<br />For those of you who actually read these things, here's a changelist from Alpha 3:
<br />
<br />1.  The Ocean has a much higher-resolution, tiled mipmap.  What this means... is that flight feels fast, and the ocean is much prettier.
<br />
<br />2.  The first baby steps towards building the World have been taken.  There are now 22 Bases you can visit and trade Goods at, as well as buy aircraft and Ships at.  Dozens of Islands have been added, to give the World a bit of scenery.  It's not terribly exciting, but it's better than the emptiness of the first few Alphas, and it gives players an opportunity to earn money through trade, instead of just slaughtering Pirates.  Starting money has been set at 20K to give players the option to switch to one of the cheaper vehicles right away, should they wish to do so, or start doing trade runs.
<br />
<br />3.  Two new drivable vehicles have been added:  the Swift Scout and the Pirate Speedboat.  The Swift Scout is now the player's starting aircraft, and is a very fast, 2-gun aircraft that's very, very fragile.  It's easier to fly than the Starflier, but players will want to switch as soon as they can afford to.
<br />
<br />4.  Machineguns now use ammunition, and have been re-balanced damage-wise.
<br />
<br />5.  All aircraft have been substantially re-balanced in various ways, mainly subtle ones.
<br />
<br />6.  The Liberty Justice Turret model has been replaced with a &quot;ball turret&quot; model.  This model has two firepoints, and can fire two shots at once, making Bombers more dangerous than before.
<br />
<br />7.  Missions have a much higher payoff, to encourage players to join together and accomplish them.
<br />
<br />8.  The Factions now use a wider variety of aircraft.
<br />
<br />9.  Bombs have been added, and the Starflier, Rhino and Mule have all had the appropriate hardpoints added.  Bombs fly straight &quot;down&quot; from the bottom of a player's ship, and are quite useful for destroying those pesky Junker Freighters <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />10.  The NY System has been abandoned, opening the possibility (weird as this may sound) of trying to accomplish the SP campaign with the new aircraft.  Given that Cruise is severely nerfed... this isn't going to work, I suspect, but people can try it if they want <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />11.  Custom EXE and custom Server files have been included in this release, to allow server ops to use this Alpha without being crashed by FL 1.0 users.
<br />
<br />In short... this is probably the last Alpha release.  WOS is now 90% feature-complete- from here on out, it's mainly about adding new content, Infocards, Rumors and other details.
<br />
<br />
<br />Disclaimer
<br />==========
<br />This is an ALPHA mod.  And no, &quot;Alpha&quot; is not a bad sitcom from the 1980's, it's a state when normally a game is so buggy and ugly that nobody gets to see it unless they're paying for it and want to know why the milestone is late <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />Normally, I wouldn't release an Alpha, but it's fun, and I think that the FL community might get a kick out of it.  This mod is virtually *garanteed* to have bugs that I haven't discovered through blowing stuff up... uh, I mean, &quot;careful beta testing&quot;.  Please install FL SDK 1.3 *before* activating the mod- it's not garanteed to prevent problems, but hey, it's how I run things here, and I haven't had this mod crash on me in ... oh... about 24 hours.
<br />
<br />If this mod crashes FL, it's an Alpha, what can I say?  You've been warned <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">How to Play Warriors of the Sky
<br />By Argh
<br />
<br />Warriors of the Sky is a completely different experience than most FL MP mods.  It takes getting used to, and beginners are likely to run into problems unless they understand how the mod works.  Therefore, I've written this little manual for you.
<br />
<br />Things to Know:
<br />
<br />1.  WOS uses the Cockpit View (with Cockpits turned ON) as the default viewpoint while flying fighter aircraft.  This is because fighters have fixed-forward machineguns, just like real aircraft did.  The cockpit used in the mod is a special custom cockpit that puts a crosshair directly on your screen, as an aid to aiming.
<br />
<br />2.  The Aircraft use wildly different physics implementations than most FL ships.  For one thing, Cruise Mode is disabled- you'll hear the &quot;cruise charging&quot; sound, and then silence, and your aircraft or boat will slow down, but Cruise will never come on.  So you're going to have to un-learn your reliance on Cruise to get you out of fights.
<br />
<br />3.  Fighters have Thrusters, which slowly use up fuel.  The fuel lasts a very long time, though, so you won't run out (unless you've circled the World, which would take quite awhile).
<br />
<br />4.  The AI is considerably tougher than in standard FL mods.  Expect to get owned until you learn how to fly and shoot, and join with other players whenever possible.
<br />
<br />5.  The Missions pay very well, but they're designed for multiple players.  You'd have to be very good to take on a Mission by yourself- stick with Trade runs across the Ocean at first.
<br />
<br />6.  Aircraft cannot take many hits before dying.  The good news is that I've left Nanos in the game, and they'll heal any Fighter to 100% health again.  The bad news is that you only get 5.
<br />
<br />7.  Machineguns use ammunition, and will eventually run out.  They do not recharge... so when you're out of ammo, it's time to land!
<br />
<br />8.  Some aircraft are too slow to run away.  If you don't have another player escorting you, then you have no choice but to fight, if a fast-moving fighter gets behind you.  If you're a peace-loving trader type and don't like this... too bad.
<br />
<br />9.  Engine-kill doesn't work any more- killing your engine will cause you to come to a halt fairly quickly instead, which may or may not be a good thing.
<br />
<br />10.  Pirates carry lots of good loot.
<br />
<br />11.  Only Boats can spawn more Encounters with Boats.  So if you want to see lots of boats, you need to buy one.
<br />
<br />12.  Bombs shoot straight down from the belly of your aircraft.  You can carry lots of bombs, and they do lots of damage, but they require a lot of practice to use right.</div>

I'm a composer (a 14-year old one at that, but my songs are cool <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) and play the piano. I also compose on my electic piano, sooooo i could do some songs for you.... i can also solve your sound effects problem <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. My problem is that i cannot hook up my electric piano to my computer.... yet. hopefully that will change. Sound effects i can do though <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />i'd give you a link but my website is having difficulties.... i could send you my song through e-mail... if you wanted.

			<div class="content">BIG NEWS:
<br />
<br />I have partially mastered FLMM xml hacking... yay, go me!
<br />
<br />So the next version will not only have tons of new content... it'll have custom icons for everything, custom names... custom stories for every location.  Sweetness.
<br />
<br />Now, if only I could find somebody to build about... 25 custom Rooms for me, I'd be all set <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Still, I'm pretty happy now... I can actually give the World a definate sense of &quot;place&quot;.  Now it's just a matter of content... all downhill from here, folks... the world of Warriors of the Sky is going to be so darn cool, when you can actually start to describe things in terms of place names, individual names for the aircraft, etc... I'm excited.</div>

			<div class="content">WOW. That is one cool mod you've got there, Argh.
<br />
<br />Have you tried playing it with the <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=1358' Target=_Blank>Extended Key Set</a> mod? If you haven't I highly suggest you try it. As this is a dogfighting mod the ability to do barrel rolls, loops and proper immelmans is not only useful, but a lot of fun as well. I can't wait to see how this turns out.</div>

			<div class="content">No, I haven't used the set yet, although I'm aware of its existence.  For now, I'm trying to play it &quot;pure&quot;, so that I keep close to what ordinary players are going to experience.  This is the first version that even has any documentation, let alone a real manual... I had to teach people how to fly in Alpha 3.
<br />
<br />BTW folks... all of the Islands have been named, etc, and I already have 3 of the aircraft assigned names, custom icons, etc.  FLMM makes things ridiculously easy once you figure it out <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />...which leads me to an Idea:  
<br />
<br />Wanna start submitting custom names to me for the different drivables?  There are 4 types of drivables planned for WOS:
<br />
<br />Zeppelins
<br />Hovertanks (don't get the wrong idea... these aren't futuristic)
<br />Ships
<br />Aircraft
<br />
<br />Here are my Aircraft names, as of right now:
<br />
<br />Sky Panther
<br />Swift Scout
<br />Grasshopper
<br />Bull
<br />Mantis
<br />Shrike
<br />Boxcar
<br />Vulture
<br />Poison Arrow
<br />
<br />Ship names:
<br />
<br />Guppy
<br />Pirahna
<br />Grouper
<br />Marlin
<br />Beluga
<br />
<br />
<br />... anyhow, as you can see, I like animal names, but I'm willing to work with other names if they fit and are thematic.  So if anybody wants to play this game, here are the proposed rules:
<br />
<br />Zeppelins must use the name of a tool, prefaced with Graf where it sounds good <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  So &quot;Graf Drill&quot; is an OK Zeppelin name, although not a likely one- I'd like to use some stranger ones, like &quot;gromet&quot; and &quot;pinout&quot;, as well a good ol' standbys like &quot;hammer&quot;.
<br />Aircraft should use the names of land animals, including birds.
<br />Ships should use the name of sea animals.
<br />Hovertanks should use a name somewhat synonymous with &quot;medieval knights&quot;.  For example, &quot;guisarme&quot; is a good hovertank name, as is &quot;bardiche&quot;, &quot;claymore&quot;, etc.

<br />
<br />Fallen_Angel has stepped up to the &quot;modeling plate&quot;, and has made some very screenshot-worthy stuff.  I'll get screenies of it as soon as I can get it skinned and implemented into Beta 2... it'll take a little bit, but it'll definately be worth the wait <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />In short, I couldn't be more pleased... things are really starting to roll here.  And a fellow named Syphon is running a server in Australia with the mod up... I played there, and despite my insaaane ping, I was still able to shoot some Pirates down and have some fun <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

Anyway, apart from the planes in the ww2 ship pack v4 I've got a P38J Lightning and a Martin Baker MB-5 which aren't finished, but the basic plane design is mostly complete. If you're interested in modders I could ask a guy who was helping out in our mod if he wants to help out, and maybe I could fit in a few designs myself. Mail me if you're interested.</div>

			<div class="content">Um, Argh, I was just playing WOS online and found myself in a &quot;Bloodhound&quot; chasing some Xenos (I think) in their &quot;Startrackers&quot;. They dove towards the ocean and I figured &quot;Aha! I'll get them when they pull out of their dive.&quot; They didn't pull up. They flew clean into the ocean and didn't die (at least I saw no evidence of death). I would have followed them but they disappeared off my scopes and I didn't really want to fly into the ocean either. You might want to take a look at that. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
