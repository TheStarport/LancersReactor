			<div class="content">OOC: I would have italicized the <i>Cerulean Dream </i>, but I forgot up to now.  The <i>Vengence </i> can be spelled any way he wants.  It's a ship's name. It doesn't need to be correct.
<br />
<br />ICC:
<br />
<br />Quigley closed into range with the pod and activated his scanners.  He waited as it scanned for life and accessed records.  It had picked up one lifeform in the pod.  No surprise, that was a fighter pod.  The computer reported records included in the pod.  
<br />
<br /><b>Escape Pod: series T1138HX.  Installed in Liberty Defender class Heavy fighter.  Ship designation: Echo 1.  Pilot: Captain Roger O'Connor. </b>
<br />
<br />Quigley quickly stabbed the tractor's trigger and brought in O'Connor's pod.  He had to get O'Connor to a station with a full med deck.  Quigley was entering the parameters into a search of his neural net when something moved in the top edge of his vision.  Quigley glanced up and about crawled out of his seats if he hadn't been strapped in.  Off his bow, facing him was a Kusari Dragon.  
<br />
<br />He heart started again when he realized it was Pswahn.  He must have also been seperated in the fight.  He saw the Dragon's running lights flashing in an unusual pattern.  Quigley gasped when he realized it was Morse code.  West Point still taught it, but it was considered to be like some form of hieroglyphs.
<br />
<br />Pswahn: <b> Sit rep </b>
<br />
<br />Quigley: <b> Comm out.  O'Connor in hold.  Injured.  </b>
<br />
<br />Pswahn: <b> Comm ditto.  You are lead.  </b>
<br />
<br />Quigley was about to flash his answer when a squeal of static filled the cabin.  Quigley thought it impossible because his comm was out.  Then he realized that the static was coming from the his personal comlink in his breast pocket.
<br />
<br />Voice: Unidentified fighters, this is Navy Gamma 3.  You are ordered to fall in formation and follow us back to the Battleship Arizona.
<br />
<br />Quigley was a little nervous, but followed orders.  He could see Pswahn fall in off his wing.  The Navy was liable to jump to conclusions and that would mean bad things for him and his companions.  Jumping to conclusions wasn't unusual for the Navy.  It had washed him out of West Point for something involving his brother Ten, a secret weapons program, and a top secret convoy's destruction.

			<div class="content">OOC: well, of course he can spell it how he wants it, but I'd assume that it isn't mispelled purposely. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> (And of course, the name is spelled
<br />P S A W H N  (Not pronounced with a 'sh', btw <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).) why can't anybody get it right? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />
<br />If the reason Psawhn was at that location for any other reason besides  destroying a secret government prototype weapon, he'd be thankful for the Navy patrol showing up. But as it was, he was a little on-edge. It didn't help that he had no idea what they were saying. Sure, the morse code worked with Quigley, and he even tried communicating <b>Comms down. Cannot recieve.    </b> (apologetically), to the Navy patrol, but he had no response. It wasn't the best of feelings, being led by several navy fighters with no way to communicate - he didn't know if they were demanding something, and growing impatient with his lack of response.
<br />
<br />In addition, he hoped they didn't decide to go to cruise speed. The nanobots had managed to repair the engine enough to get it working, but he doubted that the engine could withstand the stresses caused by cruising. Luckily, Ferrel Station wasn't too far away. (Also funny, because the other group is probably cursing its proximity, Psawhn chuckled.)
<br />
<br />Still, he at least wanted to know what the Navy might be saying to him. It's impossible to repair a comms array with nanobots, but it might be possible to reprogram his scanners to detect communication. One-way, but it's better than nothing. He set to work reprogramming his scanners.
<br />
<br />He just hoped he wouldn't be asked of something serious along the way.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />En route to the <i>Battleship Arizona </i> (Psawhn had, by now, figured out that they weren't being taken to the border station.), redoing the scanners didn't help much, as there was not any communication anyways. The only thing it did do was limit what he could see. Only one message was sent to him, and that was at the end of the flight - &quot;Dock with the Battleship.&quot;
<br />
<br />Psawhn had no idea what could mandate going to a Liberty Dreadnought. He wasn't asked any questions, but was forced down to the brig. Actually, at first it was just a holding cell. There were a few other guys in here, and they were all grimy, smelly, and obviously obnoxious. They reminded him of bounty hunters, although these guys couldn't be. They must have been rogues caught lately.
<br />
<br />Man: Whatcha in fer?
<br />Quigley: Pardon?
<br />Man: You an' yer friend. Whatcha do? Yer both in nice suits an' all.
<br />Daniel : We didn't do anything. We were just near an explosion near the New Harlem asteroid field, and when we went to look around, they Navy took us in.
<br />Man: Ah, them Police boys do that. T'aint nut'n you could do 'cept be in tha wrong place at tha wrong time, and theys put you in The Wall fer three years.
<br />Daniel was appaled. He had never heard of this, and he had never thought of the Police being so. Quigley, however, was unfazed.
<br />Daniel: But it was the navy who... brought us in.
<br />(Daniel could not quite think of himself as arrested.)
<br />Man: Yeh think therrs a differnse? What d'yeh think them navys do wit yeh after they brung yeh in? To The Wall, of curse!
<br />He was interrupted by the door opening, with three men in Navy unifoms flanking an officer. Psawhn and Quigley were taken out of the holding cell, and into a more high-security cell. Things did not look good until, not three hours later, an explosion blasted the door off of its mounting. O'Connor appeared in the smoke, yelling at them to get out. Daniel couldn't remember much about the escape to the fighter deck. Dissapointingly, neither the <i>Seer </i>, nor Quigley's <i>Cerulean Dream </i> , were on this deck, even though almost everything else was - including a pair of Rheinland Valkryies!
<br />Daniel: I'll take the Rheinland...
<br />
<br />OOC: I pushed this last bit up from later on, because it actually fits.

			<div class="content">OCC: Well actually I was spelling <i>Vengeance </i> wrong... I didn't think of this name and I sure as hell didn't know haw to write it. And I tried the italic stuff but every time I edited my post it went bak to normal and finally I just let it be.
<br />
<br />*Roger bumped along in his escape pod. He understanded that nobody else had communications working, because he grabbed his remote commdevice with him as he bailed out.*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: ...allways me...
<br />
<br />*He thought that maybe he can claifie the thing that happened to Navy because he is a captain. And he lost that darn Wolfhound he was after.*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: This is O'Connor to all indipendent fleets in New Harlem.... I need assistance... I'm hurt... bad... They are taking us to Battleship Arizona... Place is crawling with Navy and Police... erm.. bring some Spare Ribs...
<br />
<br />*Hours later on board BS Amazonas*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: my had... my arm.. my...
<br />Doctor: You were very lucky mister. U only got out of that explosion with boken arm and some laser cut on your torso. And you also have a broken rib.
<br />O'Connor: What explosion? Who am I? and why am I here?
<br />Doctor: You seem o have ammnestia. I'll call the propriate doctor.
<br />
<br />*Doctor left. O'Connor got up, grabed his clothes and and left to lower levels. As a captain he know liberty battleships very well. After a little search he found the prison cells. The guard was convinced that this was another captain of the ship and let him past. In times like this Roger felt lucky to always wear his old captain univorm.*
<br />O'Connor: Quigely, Pshawn ar you there?
<br />Quigley: Yes, is that you, Roger?
<br />O'Connor: Yes, I'm gonna get you out of here. Hang on!
<br />
<br />*Pang* *The door flew open as the smoke from explosives was still in the air*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Follow me!
<br />
<br />*Thy ran through the corridors and told anyone who was running twowards the alarm that top prioroty prisoners had escaped.*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Theres the fighter bay, take the first ship you can get.
<br />Pshawn: Ok, I'll take that Rheinland Valkyre.
<br />Quigley: I got the other Valkyre.
<br />O'Connor: You go for it, i'll catch up later... we need to find out where are the others...
<br />
<br />*All alarm went off as battleship was in battle.*
<br />
<br />Onouncer: A large fleet of pirates heading this way. All hands battlestations.
<br />
<br />*Quigley, Pshwan and O'Connor were all afraid that it might be <i>Venceance  </i>coming to bust them out. Thay all went to their newly accuird ships and launched. Roger got an Defender-xs type ship, but it had no special weapons.*
<br />So they made the new fighters anyway, even without its cannon. Thought O'Connor. When they launced they saw a massive pirate fleet. For their luck it isn't Vengeance.*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: That was the fleet that the odd Wolfhound had called in. The one I was chaing...
<br />Quigley: There are so many of them!
<br />Pshwan: Lets get the heel out of here!
<br />
<br />*As they were to start their cruise engines they got a message from a knows voice*
<br />
<br />Lutz: I've been looking for you, come on.

<br />They held there&#8217;s heads close for a few moments, whispering to each other. Michael tried to hear what was going on, but he couldn&#8217;t make it out, apart from the words &#8220;Possibly Arigosha, but who could do it?&#8221;

<br />
<br />Michael was getting more suspecious of Terranova with every passing minute...

			<div class="content">OOC: This is posted on behalf of Nickless, we had to swap posts to merge threads. This is his half.
<br />-------------------------------
<br />Michael quitly followed the rest of the group to the bar. They all knew that Quigley, O'Connor and Psawhn didn't make it to Novitano, the last they heard of them was a disrupted distress call from one of them. 
<br />They  hadn't managed to track down it's origin, because of the heavy interfearence from the Copper field. 
<br />Terranova jumped on a table and started talking. 
<br />Terranova: Guys, first of all, congratulations to all of you. We did it, the Defender and the Particle cannon are both distroyed. 
<br />Terranova waited while he looked down on &quot;his men&quot;. He was a leader again. It felt good. It felt like he was back in business. Back in command of his own wing. But this time his wing had a real weapon. Not those little peashooters the navy called Justice's. No one could do justice with those...things. 
<br />No what he had was a thousand times more powerfull. The scans of the Particle cannon  would enable him to build more, a real weapon you could do justice with. Ultimate justifier . Better yet, <b>Apocalypse </b>. 
<br />He would bring down Apocalypse on them. 
<br />Terranova smiled, he had them all fooled. And Lutz the most. 
<br />Lutz; Terranova clould barely hold his laughter as he thought of what a trick he had played on Lutz. He had played him like a fool, just like everyone else. They had all helped him to obtain his weapon. 
<br />And now he would repay them the favour. 
<br />Michael, who had watched Terranova enjoy his victory, stepped forward. 
<br />Michael: I don't think we're ready yet. There's still the matter of Quigley, O'Connor and Psawhn. Just before we landed, I received a distress call directed at the independent fleet. 
<br />I bet it's from one of them and they are probably still  there. 
<br />I think it's vital for the succes of our little operation that we get them to safety. The signal was very weak though, so I couldn't trace it to it's exact location, but they must still be around there. 
<br />Terranova took the lead again. 
<br />Terranova: Very well Michael, then I sugest that you and Lutz check it out. If they are still around, it's most likely that their engines are busted so you might want to take Arrigoni with you in case you need to tow the ships to safety. In the mean time I will stay behind to help repair the <i>Vengeance </i>. We can't stay around here  for too long. Sooner or later, someone will find us. I mean, when a patrol stumbles across a wrecked base, even if it's a pirate base, they will check everything. 
<br />Michael: You might want to go to <b>Athlon Base </b> in Kepler. It's a Hacker base, I practicaly lived there the last four years. I'll upload the coordinates to your navmap Terranova and inform the base of your arival. You'll be safe there and they will help you with repairs and such. You won't find better mechanics anywhere else. Lutz, Arrigoni and I will meet up with you when we have the others. 
<br />Terranova: Good. Any questions? 
<br />*silence* 
<br />Terranova: To your ships then. 
<br />Terranova looked at the men as they wandered back to their ships. This is only getting better. Hackers, they would certainly be able to get him what he needed to make his weapon work. He was very content to see that all had worked out as he had planned. Ever since Danson told him about the Particle cannons, he new he wanted one, or two. One was  on Lutz's [iDefiant, one was...somewhere possibly destroyed, but most importantly he had the plans to make as many as he wanted. Yes, he could already see his ship flying around with the Particle cannons mounted. Such power, allmost devine. 
<br />Michael: This is Freelancer trading party to Novitano Docking ring control, requesting permission to depart. 
<br />DrC: This is docking ring control, to Freelancer trading party, permission granted, docking ring is clear. Have a save flight. 
<br />they left Novitano behind and headed straight to the pirate base, or at  least where it used to be. 
<br />Michael: Guys, I'm uploading coordinates to Athlon Base to your navmaps. That way, if we get separated we can each find our way to savety. 
<br />Arrigoni: Uhm, Michael, you do realise that there will most likely be a lot of navy wings  out there. Any ideas on how we're going to do this. 
<br />But Lutz had the answer. 
<br />Lutz: I know from my days in the navy that most bandits that were arrested here, were taken to Battleship Arizona. My guess is that's where O'Connor, Psawhn and Quigley must be. That is, if they were arrested. Which I hope, because it's probably their only chance of suvival. When those pirates come back when they are still around... 
<br />Lutz stopped, they all knew what pirates used to do to prisoners. especially those who blew up their base. 
<br />It was common use for the pirates to drag a prisoner. That's basicaly putting someone in a vacsuit and dragging him behind their ship through an astroid field until he was dead.  Keal hauling... Not the nicest way to go. But something about the base just didn't add-up...  
<br />Michael was glad his scanner worked again and at a range of 5k no less, That way he could detect the Cruiser before it detected them. 
<br />Michael: Hold it guys. I detect a Liberty cruiser and several fighter wings. 
<br />Arrigoni: *whistle* 
<br />Lutz: Sounds like the whole goddamn fleet. Any sign of their ships Michael? 
<br />Michael: No and no sign of escapepods too. Wait a minute, I can hack the nearest tradelane ring to see if any of their ships passed by. If you're right Lutz, and they were taken to Battleship Arizona, they must have passed through here. 
<br />So finaly the tricks the Lane Hackers had thought him came in handy. He had refused to use it as a weapon to attack convoys, or even participate in any of those attacks. He didn't want to lower himself to criminal actions, he was a merchant. 
<br />Michael: Seems like we're lucky guys. They did pass here about an hour ago. 
<br />Lutz: we better be quick then. 
<br />They entered the tradelane and headed for the Colorado   
<br />Lutz: lets hope they wern't already transferred to LPI Sugarland. Then there's nothing more we can do except hope they don't rat us out. There is the jumpgate, all seems to be clear, lets hurry. 
<br />*jump* 
<br />Michael, Lutz and Arrigoni entered Colorado. 
<br />Michael: My scanner's clear. Lets go, the Arizona is just on the other side of the icecloud, it'll cover us for most of the way. 
<br />They kicked in their cruises and headed straight for the Battleship. 
<br />Arrigoni: So, what's the plan, are we just gonna ask them to give us our friends back? 
<br />Michael: I don't know, I guess we'll just have to wait and see, but expect the worst. 
<br />For a while everything seemed to go allright, but that was merely deceipt. 
<br />Michael: Holy cow, my whole scanner has just gone red, I read enemies all over the place. I read at least 15 Pirates, but oddly they aren't moving, and they're at extreme range... 
<br />When they got out of the cloud, they saw something they would not soon forget. 
<br />At  least two pirate cruisers were in the background, and around 20 pirate ships.  To make matters worse the <i>Arizona </i> was headed straight for them.  
<br />For a moment Michael didn't know where to look. But then all of a sudden he noticed two Valkyries and a very formiliar looking defender dropping from the belly of the giant Battleship. 
<br />Lutz: I see them! 
<br />He hailed the Defender. 
<br />Lutz: We've been looking for you guys. Come on, lets get out of here. 
<br />O'Connor: Finaly, where were you? 
<br />O'Connor wanted to say more, were it not that at that particular moment all hell broke loose.</div>

			<div class="content">OCC: And here's the third part... I've played it so at the end EVERYONE is at this battle. Hope that's OK with you all. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />-----------------------------
<br />Lutz rounded the underneath of the Arizona , flying past the opening fighter bay. Immediately he picked up the frequency of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s Comm. unit. 
<br />
<br />Lutz: &#8220;I've been looking for you, come on&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Finally, where were you!?&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Defiant  blasted past the gapping maw of the fighter bay, the three ships falling in behind
<br />
<br />Lutz: &#8220;What the hell&#8230;?! You&#8217;re flying an XS! What&#8217;s going on!?&#8221; He screamed as cannon fire from the Arizona  blasted everywhere
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Lutz, they had one in the hanger. We&#8217;ve stolen it. Quigley and Psawhn are in a pair of Valkyries. God know what they&#8217;re doing on a Liberty Cruiser. We have to get out of here, quick! Look at the size of that pirate fleet! There&#8217;s over 30 fighters, and 3 cruisers!&#8221; Missiles were firing from the Arizona , a couple hit home, but thankfully they weren&#8217;t the shield killers that they&#8217;d been dreading.
<br />Lutz: &#8220;You let me worry about that fleet! Has your XS got a particle cannon on it? It&#8217;s in the lower right of the main weapons panel. Arrigoni! Are you OK!?&#8221; In a last bid to take a ship dpwn the Arizona  had concentrated all firepower on to The Camel  which was pouring plasma from it&#8217;s engines&#8230;
<br />Arrigoni: &#8220;Yeah! She&#8217;ll hold! The beauty ain&#8217;t let me down yet!&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Erm Lutz, no, it&#8217;s got something that says Stormblade&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Jesus Christ&#8230; They got Stormblade working&#8230; Have you got any shield batteries on board?&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: Yeah, 30 of them, full load. What the hell is Stormblade?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;OK, listen. The Defender-XS wasn&#8217;t only a prototype fighter, it was a weapons testing platform. It was designed to rival the Rheinland Valkyrie, but because of the nature of the ship it was also used to test weapons. If there was one of these prototype ships on board the Arizona  then they either got Stormblade working or someone very important is on that ship. Come on, follow me, the Vengeance  is close by, about 40 clicks away, hidden behind a small moon.&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Are you 3 here on your own?
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Here,  yes. But the rest of us are back at the Vengeance waiting.&#8221;
<br />Michael: &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to break up the re-union tour here chaps, but that fleet is following us. We&#8217;re out of range of any WASPs they may use, but they&#8217;re only 3 clicks behind, cruisers and all. If we don&#8217;t do something we&#8217;ll lead them right into the Vengeance , and we can&#8217;t take that many ships out&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;You&#8217;re right, we must do something&#8230; I got an idea&#8230;&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Lutz! What the hell is Stormblade!?&#8221;
<br />Lutz, sighs&#8230; &#8220;The particle cannon was called Fireblade, because it destroyed matter and created a fire so to speak on the target. Stormblade works with energy instead&#8230; it&#8217;s destroys shields instantly. It was a joint development with the Kusari Forces. It showed much more promise than Fireblade ever did. Fireblade was abandoned late on, but Stormblade was kept on. Evidently they got it working. And you&#8217;ve got the prototype.&#8221;
<br />Pshwan: &#8220;How come you got Fireblade working and the best minds of Liberty couldn&#8217;t?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t. I figured out that the charge up capacitor wasn&#8217;t powerful enough, and I imagine they did too. But I did something they didn&#8217;t, went elsewhere for help. Liberty researchers are a bit too arrogant for my liking. Froan was more than willing to help, but because he&#8217;s originally from Rheinland the Liberty authorities didn&#8217;t think of contacting him. Good job too. He&#8217;s probably the only man who can repair the particle cannons, and he&#8217;s under our control. I was surprised that Liberty made a joint research team with Kusari, but then I think it was politically motivated and nothing was ever meant to come of it. Something did though, Stormblade. And part of the Defender-XS is too, the powerplant.&#8221;
<br />Michael: &#8220;Erm&#8230; the pirates behind us please?&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;What about the Arizona ? What&#8217;s that doing out here firing at us, and with no escort in hostile territory ?
<br />Michael: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m reading this right&#8230; but it looks like it&#8217;s following them&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Andy Smith. Betcha.&#8221; (OCC: Please read my character profile, first post of the techy thread)
<br />Pshwan: &#8220;Who?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Andrew Smith. He is, was , my superior back in Alaska. Something was very fishy. I was effectively set up for the failure of a mission, a mission designed to test the particle cannon. A lot of bull**** went into the trial, and he was behind it. I think he wants Fireblade for himself. When this was dropped he settled for Stormblade. It&#8217;s not as destructive, but still an awesome weapon. Hence that&#8217;s why you have a Defender-xs kitted out with one. I&#8217;m willing to bet my life that he&#8217;s defecting.&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Lutz this is serious. Who would he be defecting to?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. These pirates are fishy too. Notice how when we scan them you don&#8217;t get a true ID? You get attacked by a Corsair you damn well know about it. All pirate clans I know of transmit their clan name, a habit born of pride and arrogance.&#8221;
<br />Psawhn: &#8220;Lutz is right. I killed a couple of them, but all I got for a name was pirate. A couple of them read as unknown too.&#8221;
<br />Quigley: &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;One of three things. It could be a new pirate clan without a name&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Psawhn: &#8220;It could be a &#8220;true&#8221; pirate clan, not after a name or a reputation, just an efficient way of robbing. Or it could be&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />No one spoke. No-one had too. The last option was the most worrying of all.
<br />Quigley, sighed: &#8220;Or they could be part of a known clan, and be masquerading.&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Yes. And we&#8217;re about to find out. A lot has been happening in the day or so that you left. The vengeance  has been outfitted with a particle cannon. 120 people have worked none stop on it. Except that bastard Terranova.&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;What?! You put that monstrosity on the Vengeance ?&#8221;
<br />Quigley: &#8220;And what&#8217;s Terranova been up to?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Knowing full well that he couldn&#8217;t get the design for the particle from me or the second destroyed XS he scanned the third one as he took down the shields. He&#8217;s vanished, kidnapped Froan too. We tried to track him but we failed. He&#8217;s too slippery. I&#8217;m gonna hunt the sucker down. When I&#8217;m through with him he&#8217;ll know the true meaning of the WidowMaker&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Damn it, Terranova, I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d do that&#8230; but hang on, if Froan been kidnapped who&#8217;s made the capacitor for the Vengeance ? And how have they done it that fast? Didn&#8217;t yours&#8230;
<br />Lutz, interupting &#8220;Ships engines. We&#8217;ve routed them through to the weapons grid. It was how Froan fixed your main cannons. Denson modified the idea.&#8221;
<br />Quigley: &#8220;So what are we gonna do about them pirates behind us?&#8221;
<br />Lutz, grinning &#8220;Why Quigley, we&#8217;re going to kill them of course&#8230;&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Are you made? We don&#8217;t have the firepower to take out three cruisers and 30 fighters&#8230; and  the Arizona &#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Yes we do. You&#8217;ve got the Stormblade, and both my ship and the Vengeance  have got Fireblades. We&#8217;re gonna hit them like they&#8217;ve never been hit before. *Radios ahead* This is Lutz, Denson, we&#8217;ve got visitors. 30 flies and 4 hornets. What&#8217;s the condition of our nest?&#8221;
<br />Denson: &#8220;Bug swatters are up and running&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Did you make contact with our &#8220;Friends?&#8221;&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;What friends?&#8221;
<br />Denson: &#8220;Lutz and figured it out O&#8217;Connor. These pirates that we&#8217;ve been attacking aren&#8217;t pirates. There&#8217;s a group in the area, what remains of a clan that was virtually wiped out 6 months ago, you may remember them, the Arigosha&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;Heard of them. They were against the semi doctorial ideals of the Rheinland Government weren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
<br />Denson: &#8220;Yes. There was a massive battle 6 months ago, virtually no ships escaped, and many were captured. Since then there have been impostors I their place, Rheinland ones. They want to fight back, get revenge against the military.&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;I think I just brought them with us&#8230; Do me a favour then, and keep the Liberty Battleship Arizona  alive. I was right about these pirates, lets hope I&#8217;m right about their leader&#8230;&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;How the hell did you figure that out?!&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Easy. Our attack on the base was too anticipated. Notice how all those fighters kept pouring in? No pirate clan, with the possible exception of the Corsairs is that organised. Something had to be up. The base was almost deserted as well. They knew we were coming. I think we caught them in the act of vanishing with the technology. But when we attacked they saw my ship, the only working Defender-xs with a particle cannon. They&#8217;d got all the info they needed to make one, but to have a working ship was a bonus. They turned round and attacked.&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t explain how you figured this out?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;The last Defender-xs was still docked. It was virtually completely un-guarded. No pirate clan would ever leave a prize like that unguarded. And even if they did no force in this universe would cause them to abandon their base. Therefore whoever we was fighting mustn&#8217;t have been pirates. The Rheinland Military looked and behaved like that Arigosha clan, but they didn&#8217;t think  like them. I knew what had happened, but I didn&#8217;t know who either side was. Now we know. And now there will be a reckoning.&#8221;
<br />Denson: &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you there will be. Most of the Arigosha clan was based here, but a small development was happening in the next system. I&#8217;ve brought some 87 fighters with me, all after revenge for there fallen comrades.&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;Good. Lets make this work. Are you on the darkside of the moon?&#8221;
<br />Denson: &#8220;Negative. We&#8217;re under the southern polar axis, the magnetic field will scramble all scanners. Just fly in boys. We&#8217;ve got a welcoming party awaiting you&#8230; I&#8217;m reading you at 5 clicks and closing&#8230;&#8221;
<br />O&#8217;Connor: &#8220;So why the fake ship ID&#8217;s?&#8221;
<br />Lutz: &#8220;I dunno that part&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Denson: &#8220;Probably because of their allies. If they got to heavily involved with any other pirate caln they&#8217;d be exposed. This was they had a semblance of invisibility. You better get ready guys, we&#8217;re swinging round now, you&#8217;ll have a visual in just a couple of seconds&#8230; 4 clicks and closing, and the whole party  is here&#8230;
<br />

			<div class="content">Well... he got what he wanted. One of the best weapons avaible in the universe, mounted on his ship. He finally got away from those ignorant fools. But &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;. He can't remember who said that but it sounded cool to say, he figured. 
<br />
<br />Terranova pushed a button in his cockpit.
<br />Terranova: &quot;EVA, where are we right now?
<br />EVA (that's how he called his NeuralNet): &quot;As you humans like to say it, in the middle of nowhere. Nearest station: 250k clicks, nearest planet: 400k clicks&quot;.
<br />Terranova: &quot;Did you hear that, Froan? No one can rescue you and remember, when you try to rescue yourself, you first have to eliminate me. And that's almost impossible...
<br />*Vincenzo lets his hand slip over his gun holster*
<br />Terranova: &quot;You heard me Froan?&quot;
<br />Froan (who was thrown in the back of the ship, hands and feet tied and a piece of paper stuck in his mouth: &quot;mumble mumble mumble.&quot;
<br />Terranova: &quot;I'm glad you understand me, slimebag. And whenever you need to fix the capacitor, be sure of it that I'll point a gun at you, for you can't eleminate me.&quot;
<br />
<br />They they were: Terranova, Froan and not to forget the Particle Cannon (aka Fireblade). Destination: unknown. Mission: revenge. Pirates, be aware. Terranova is heading your direction and he is triggerhappy!
<br />
<br />He seemed pretty self-confidant. But what he didn't know, was that Lutz was coming after him. The Battle of the Titans was bound to take place
<br />
<br />OOC: Titans as in: heroes, arch enemies and whatever. So I'm not talking about a ship.

			<div class="content">Quigley gritted his teeth.  The Valkerie was dead cow compared to his Cerulean Dream .  But he did like the power it held.  The guns were far more powerful; they were all Hornvipers.  Quigley grinned; he liked guns with fast refire rates.
<br />
<br />O'Connor, Pswahn, and he were now free, but he didn't like the fact that he'd just been involved in a jail break from Liberty battleship.  Now, he was headed insanely toward a large pirate fleet.  What pirate fleet has cruisers?  
<br />
<br />Quigley felt sick because he knew he was in way over his head.  He listened to the radio traffic and only felt worse.  The only bright point the conversation was Lutz's order to leave the Arizona  alone.  He may have just burst out of there, but his consience wouldn't allow him fire on Liberty ships.  He was still Libertonian and a patriot.  Also, his ship was still in its hangar bay.
<br />
<br />As he barreled toward the fleet, Terranova's absence bothered him.  Terranova ws unstable and deceitful.  One of the others had told him he was out for revenge for some pirates killing his family.  But who would he hurt along the way?  Terranova didn't seem to be a man to hesitate from firing if innocents were in the way.  Now he had a superlaser and the man who can get it working.  Quilgey's idealism swelled in him, and his sense of duty took over.  After this furball, he would stop Terranova whether the others joined in or no.  Terranova's wrath was dangerous and deadly.  But Quigley knew he must risk it all to save someone he'd never met so they would never feel the pain of loss. 
<br />
<br />Before he left though, he must ask Lutz how much he knew about his brother, Ten, and his death with the convoy's destruction.  He had to know the story behind his death and how it had caused him to be washed-out.  Why had the Navy been afraid, angry, or suspicious of him.  His brother hadn't told him anything about the project or the secret convoy.

<br /><b>Micheal:   </b> We're about three minutes from the <i>Vengeance's   </i> position.
<br />
<br />Psawhn's mind was reeling. He wasn't used to events happening so suddenly like this. He could focus on what was happening, but that was it. He could barely remark on what brought him to this situation, flying a heap of junk known to be Rheinland's elite ship.
<br />
<br /><b>Micheal:   </b> I've picked up the <i>Vengeance   </i> on my scanners. Not much farther, guys.
<br />
<br />Facing at least two dozen enemy fighters, two (or three, he couldn't remember) cruisers, and a battleship definitely rose up one's tension level. Add to that an unfamiliar interface, combined with an unfamiliar ship, in an incredibly unfamiliar situation, and you get incredible nerves.
<br />
<br /><b>Micheal:   </b> One minute until rendevouz.
<br /><b>Lutz:   </b> Get ready for action!
<br />
<br />Psawhn gritted his teeth, and prepared for the most intense battle he had ever taken part in.
<br />
<br />OOC: I've pushed that flashback back to my other post.
<br />OOC: Spelling Lesson! Todays word: Daniel Morlone's callsign! Now, repeat after me:
<br />P. S. A. W. H. N. Very good! Once more... very nice! Now, are we gonna spell it any differently from now on? (No.) That's right!
<br />(That concludes our irregular spelling session.) (Sorry if that's a bit... cynical, but I'm kind of tired of seeing Pswanh (Swan? That's an insult!) or Pshawn. (Sean/Shawn!? It's not supposed to be said like that) or, worst of all, Pshwanh. (Shwann? Wth? Sean the Swan?)

			<div class="content">(OOC: would you please stop posting these stupid posts in this topic, this is not a discusion topic. If you have any complains about anything storyrelated, post them in the thechy bit's)
<br />
<br />Some story lutz has been telling. First there is this other defender-XS that O'Connor suddenly appears with. Now there seems to be yet another prototype weapon called the Stormblade, wich is currently mounted on O'Connor's ship.
<br />Then there is the matter of the Pirates who are no pirates and a Liberty cruiser wich is controlled by a Navy Officer who is probably defecting.
<br />Things just got a whole lot more interesting.
<br />Pirates he could take, even the three cruisers they are carrying along won't be to much of a problem with the Particle cannon attached to the <i>vengeance </i>. But if O'Connor has stolen a ship with a stormblade from the <i>Arizona </i>, who knows how much more there could be.
<br />And, last but certainly not least, Terranova. That bastard! He had kidnapped Froan, the onlyone who could build a particle cannon, and had somehow got a hold of the designplans of that awefull gun. 
<br />Michael could kill himself, he'd failed. He prommised himself to never let Terranova out of his sight so he could prevent Terranova to get his filthy hands on that gun. It must have happend in the pirate base, it was the only time Michael had let him out of his sight.
<br />
<br />But it didn't matter at that moment. They had other things to attend to. Like those pirates and their cruisers, wich followed them at some three klicks behind. And ofcourse, the Battleship.
<br />Michael had never fought a battleship before, but he had witnessed it's increddible power when he was still a Police officer. They were attacked by hordes of Corsairs who, for some crazy reason, tried to take over the Gallileo system. The Battleship Nevada had taken out 90% of the Corsair fighters and all of the 10 Gunboats...But it had a weak spot though, the engine was very exposed, and a few torpedo's could easily take out the cruise of a battleship. And a few more could take out the engines completely and set the ship adrift.
<br />That was maybe their only chance they had to get away from the Battleship, should it decide to attack.
<br />But first the fighters, The <i>Vengeance </i> would take care of the cruisers and protect them from the <i>Arizona </i>.
<br />
<br />Michael: I've picked up the <i>Vengeance </i> on my scanner. Not much farther guys.
<br />
<br />Michael: One minute till randezvous.
<br />
<br />The tension got higher and higher as they rapidly closed in on the small moon. 
<br />
<br />Michael: Here we are, cut your cruise engines everyone.
<br />
<br />They rounded the moon and as they got behind it they cut their cruise engines.
<br />A massive fleet of fighters awaited them, all ready to avenge their fallen comrades.
<br />
<br />Danson: Good to see you're allright guys.
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Good to see you too Danson, And we're bringing home the bacon.
<br />
<br />Danson: I see it on my scanner. They keep popping up in the strangest places don't they. And a need gun you've got there aswel.
<br />
<br />Lutz: yeah, and somehow I've got the fealing we'll be needing it very soon.
<br />
<br />Michael: here they are now. Ok, This is it! ready your weapons and engage on my signal.</div>
