<br />F.F.F  -  Frobozz Freelancer FAQ
<br />
<br />A Freelancer Demo &amp; Newbie FAQ, By Frobozz
<br />Date: 10 March, 2003   Version: 0.10 Beta
<br />
<br />1. Installation
<br />2. General
<br />3. Ships
<br />4. Weapons and Equipment
<br />5. Commodities and Salvage
<br />6. Locations
<br />7. End Notes 
<br />
<br />
<br />1. First things First:
<br />
<br />Demo System Requirements claim that &quot;Freelancer Trial Version requires
<br />DirectX&#174; 9 or greater&quot; Bull. It worked fine in Win98SE with DX 8.1b for me, 
<br />and probably for you too if your drivers are up to date. Try running the demo
<br />FIRST before diving into a DirectX update, trust me. If the demo works ,
<br />chances are good so will the full game. Unclick DX 9.0 box in installation.
<br />
<br />The first few missions are the training missions, and are very easy. Accept.
<br />When you find yourself on Planet Pittsburgh, save the game. Your save game
<br />files are put in the 'My Documents' folder. The file names are in code, but date
<br />stamps should help you figure out which is which. Email 'em to your friends!
<br />
<br />(Pros: For a faster load time, edit the freelancer.ini file in the EXE dir:
<br />
<br />[Startup
<br />;movie_file = movies\MGS_Logo_Final.wmv
<br />;movie_file = movies\DA_Logo_Final.wmv
<br />;movie_file = movies\FL_Intro.wmv
<br />
<br />The ; rem out the logo movies. This works in the retail version, too)
<br />
<br />With the retail version, don't try to copy the CD, it won't work.
<br />There does exist , however, a NO CD patch. Easy to find in a search,
<br />I will _not_ tell you where. This is 'Fair Use' in my book, I want to put
<br />that $50 plastic disk in a safe place, with little kids around. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />2. General hints: coming soon
<br />
<br />3. Ships:
<br />
<br />A good rule with Ships is to avoid Freighters until the storyline is over.
<br />This applies to the retail game, too. Don't think you can switch back &amp;
<br />forth from Fighters to Freighters cuz ships are like cars: the second
<br />you buy them, they depreciate! Buy a ship and compare the price of your
<br />NEW ship with a ship on the lot. Ouch. Speaking of buying ships:
<br />
<br />When buying a ship, take your time. Click everywhere before you sign on
<br />the dotted line. Look at the equipment. Wouldn't your old shields work
<br />just as good as the new ones? Check the stats, then check the prices!
<br />Often times you can unmount and send back the dealer's equipment and 
<br />install your own at great savings! 
<br />
<br />4. Weapons and Equipment:
<br />
<br />coming soon
<br />
<br />Don't blow your money on Shield upgrades when you are likely to upgrade
<br />to a bigger class of ship soon anyway. The Shields are class-specific.
<br />
<br />5. Commodities and Salvage: coming soon
<br />6. Locations: coming soon
<br />
<br />7. Last things Last:
<br />
<br />After you've finished the demo, don't uninstall it, instead use it as a 
<br />simulator for the simulator! The demo ends at Level 2, but you can get a 
<br />saved game for the demo that will give you a 1 million credit limit at:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://freelancer.portalive.com">http://freelancer.portalive.com</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />(Thanks, Sir Carcass!)
<br />
<br />Now go to <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lancersreactor.com">www.lancersreactor.com</a><!-- w --> and download: Weapon and Ship Mod v.0.3 
<br />
<br />This MOD enables all the ships and weapons that are hidden in the sourcecode
<br />of the Demo. (Thanks to Mubata)
<br />
<br />Now you can try out loadouts painlessly, and play with class 10 guns! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />(Pros: For a faster load time, edit the freelancer.ini file in the EXE dir:
<br />
<br />[Startup
<br />;movie_file = movies\MGS_Logo_Final.wmv
<br />;movie_file = movies\DA_Logo_Final.wmv

<br />I will _not_ tell you where. This is 'Fair Use' in my book, I want to
<br />put that $50 plastic disk in a safe place, with little kids around. 
<br />
<br />2. General Info:
<br />
<br />This FAQ (more of a help file than a faq, really) is geared toward Demo
<br />and new players. I won't bury you with ship spec charts and commodity
<br />price lists. Those are available when you need them from other sources.
<br />What I give you is practical hints. Stuff you'd eventually learn on 
<br />your own, but with a lot of unenjoyable frustration.
<br />
<br />The manual isn't so good. What's better is to save your game, then
<br />Launch and play around with the controls. Mouseover all the HUD Menu
<br />buttons and try them out to learn how to use them. If you get attacked,
<br />use it as a learning experience and don't worry - you saved the game 
<br />after all. Learn how/why to select/deselect weapons. How far your Target
<br />Status Monitor detects. Fire your weapons dry, see how long it takes for
<br />them to recharge. Afterburn. Fly around and explore, it's fun.
<br />
<br />Familiarize yourself with the Dock menus the same way. No danger, but you
<br />will lose cash so save first. Buy stuff &amp; sell it. Compare commodity 
<br />prices. Mount and unmount weapons. Look at the weapons at the dealer. 
<br />
<br />
<br />3. Ships:
<br />
<br />Go in the shipyard and compare the various ship statistics.
<br />All ships go at the same speed. So what makes a big freighter different 
<br />to fly than a light fighter is the turning speed (maneuverability).
<br />
<br />A good rule with ships is to avoid Freighters until the storyline is over.
<br />This applies to the retail game, too. Don't think you can switch back &amp;
<br />forth from Fighters to Freighters cuz ships are like cars: the second
<br />you buy them, they depreciate! Buy a ship and compare the price of your
<br />NEW ship with a ship on the lot. Ouch. Speaking of buying ships:
<br />
<br />When buying a ship, take your time. Click everywhere before you sign on
<br />the dotted line. Look at the equipment. Wouldn't your old shields work
<br />just as good as the new ones? Check the stats, then check the prices!
<br />Often times you can unmount and send back the dealer's equipment and 
<br />install your own at great savings! 
<br />
<br />
<br />4. Weapons and Equipment:
<br />
<br />Guns.
<br />Guns are your primary weapon. They have lots of confusing attributes,
<br />good against this type shield - bad against that etc., etc.
<br />Don't worry about that stuff - here's the basics. 
<br />
<br />Weapons have a classification, which is pretty general and mostly
<br />applies to the rating of the Hardpoint on your ship where you want to
<br />mount it. Ships have a maximum weapon class, but so does a particular
<br />mounting location. Just because you CAN load every slot with it's
<br />max weapon class don't mean you SHOULD. A frequently overlooked
<br />ship stat is Optimal Weapon Rating. (read as average) Overload this 
<br />badly and you will hear a 'clunk' for your trigger halfway through
<br />a fire-fight. Not good. Power drain number is a critical attribute.
<br />
<br />Weapons have two damage numbers, one for shields, one for hull.
<br />Obviously, what the gun will do to the target depends on if you've
<br />gotten through his shields. A great gun for demolishing shields is
<br />the Stunpulse. It's fire rate is four and does a whopping 155 shield
<br />damage like a class 7 gun! Of course, it does little to hulls, so 
<br />deploy it with three other guns to actually kill the bogie.
<br />
<br />The most under appreciated, but vital, gun statistic is velocity.
<br />Your aiming solution computer aim point is based upon the FASTEST
<br />projectile. Mis-match your gun projectile speeds, and you will see
<br />your 750 M/S Pulse shots hit the bogie and the 500 M/S Plasma shots
<br />miss behind his tail by a mile. Some discrepancy is unavoidable,
<br />but be aware. This is less important in head/tail shots, obviously.
<br />
<br />Fire rate is also important. Don't be wowed by the Plasma weapons
<br />powerful punch, the fire rate is a lousy 2 and the speed is slow 500.
<br />
<br />Missiles.
<br />Missiles come in two types, like most space sims. Dumbfire and Homing.
<br />Dumbfire missiles have three basic uses. You're following the bogie and
<br />run out of gun energy. You are closing head on with a group of far-
<br />off bogies. Large, slow or stationary targets. (not found in the demo)
<br />Don't BUY a missile launcher. You will eventually salvage one.
<br />
<br />Torpedoes &amp; Cruise Disruptors.
<br />These are even more narrow in scope, and of NO use in the demo.
<br />
<br />Mine Droppers.
<br />Mines are essential for freighters, but problematic in any mission
<br />where you have allies. They CAN hit friends, even YOU. Salvage, not buy.
<br />
<br />Countermeasure Dropper.
<br />Get this, when money allows. They also work on Cruise Disruptors.
<br />
<br />Other.
<br />Don't blow your money on Shield upgrades when you are likely to upgrade
<br />to a bigger class of ship soon anyway. The Shields are class-specific.
<br />Thrusters are NOT ship specific, get a better one as afterburner is
<br />used in combat. A lot. I never salvaged an improved afterburner.
<br />
<br />
<br />5. Commodities and Salvage:
<br />
<br />
<br />Commodities come in two varieties. Bulk and high value. Your fighter
<br />has way too small a cargo hold to bother with bulk stuff like oxygen,
<br />water, food, etc. That's what freighters are for. Sell off this junk
<br />you have Looted even at low prices to free up cargo space. Hold out on
<br />the high value stuff for a good price, it's profit per cargo space. 
<br />
<br />Learn how to tractor loot early &amp; often, even in combat. Learn how
<br />to eject cheap Commodities like Scrap Metal to make room for precious ones.
<br />Don't do this in combat, as it drops your shields!
<br />
<br />Ships carry fixed numbers of Shield Batteries and Nanobots. These are
<br />common Loot, and can save your buns. I usually launch with less than full
<br />load of Nanobots after I had to leave many of these $200 jewels behind.
<br />
<br />When you Loot weapons and equipment, do NOT be in a hurry to sell them.
<br />Think of them as your bank savings account. They take up NO room in your
<br />cargo hold, and may be usable on later ships. Especially in the retail
<br />game, quick cash is handy for emergency maintenance costs, like repairs.
<br />
<br />
<br />6. Locations: 
<br />
<br />Your Neural Net Nav Map shows very little base/station information when
<br />you first enter a system. But it DOES show you every path that ships
<br />patrol on. (Not talking about the trade lanes) This is stupid and backwards
<br />if you ask me, I'm sure non-hidden bases will be in every nav map database!
<br />You can use this bug to locate bases and things off the trade lanes by
<br />seeing where everyone is going. Ships don't just go to nowhere for nothing.
<br />
<br />7. Reputation:
<br />
<br />Rep, as it's known, is an important part of the game. Pick your enemies
<br />with care, or too many people will be after your hide. Getting a faction
<br />hostile to you has consequences beyond the battlefield, now you can't
<br />dock at their base or get offered their missions.
<br />
<br />In the demo, the faction you learn this with is the Junkers. They have a 
<br />base, which you want to be able to dock with, especially if you want to
<br />eventually become a freighter captain. With this in mind, never NEVER
<br />accept a mission that targets a Junker. Don't mine asteroids, either.
<br />Not only is mining slow and boring, but threatens Junker turf.
<br />You may also find yourself hailed by some Junker who demands you dump
<br />some cargo. When this happened to me, he always overlooked high-value
<br />cargo like Gold and wanted Bulk cargo like food. Let him HAVE it.
<br />It may gall, but think of it like a tax to keep your Rep neutral.
<br />Check your Player Status (in the Neural Net menu) periodically to
<br />see how your actions have effected your Rep.
<br />
<br />8. Last things Last:
<br />
<br />After you've finished the demo, don't uninstall it, instead use it as a 
<br />simulator for the simulator! The demo ends at Level 2, but you can get a 
<br />saved game for the demo that will give you a 1 million credit limit at:

<br />Sorry about posting the whole FAQ again, the forum wouldn't allow me to edit
<br />the original post. I'll try to edit the 2nd beta when it goes to 3rd beta,
<br />or just post the sections that are updated. For sure I see updates in section
<br />4, Clarify Non-Homing VS true Dumbfire for example, and in section 5.
