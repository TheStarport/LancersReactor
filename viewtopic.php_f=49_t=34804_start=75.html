			<h3><a href="#p324067" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">On the battle station, a ship of sith design was approaching. The pass code was asked for and received. The craft docked in a smaller landing bay with only five troopers to greet the guest. A mistake indeed. 
<br />
<br />The rear hatch opened and the hooded and robed figure swept out and headed towards the corridor. The troopers blocked his path. &#8220;That will be all, you may go&#8221; he spoke, a gesture with a hand. The troopers turned and walked away.  The figure continued to the door that hissed open and he disappeared into the maze of corridors, his destination set already. He took the first turbo lift to the command deck. His pass code over rode all security functions. 
<br />
<br />Surprise was on the faces of all on the deck. No one was suppose to arrive unannounced, not even the commander. A guard started to approach but stopped as quickly. &#8220;Hold your place&#8221; the figure spoke. The one in charge caught on quickly to what was going on and tripped a switch that would call the commander to the bridge. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Can I be of service, the Man asked. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, I will wait for the commander to arrive&#8221; the figure spoke and moved to look out the view port. Ships sailed by, fighters weaving in and out of formations. A frigate dropping out of hyper space and maneuvering to take up a position in orbit. The reflection in the glass gave the sub-commander a different view of the figure. He had seen a similar face like that before, but could not remember where, then it struck him, on Iridonia, he was a Zabrak. They have been seen as sith before, with Maul. He was a little more concerned now. There were rumors of the sith returning. Everyone knew of Darth Sidious, who was the Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, but both were dead. Where did this one come from and who trained him. 
<br />
<br />The door to the bridge opened and the commander stopped in. His eyes looked over the bridge, stopping at the robed figure. He ordered the room cleared. All looked to see it he was joking. &#8220;I said clear out, Now!&#8221; he shouted. Every one headed to the lift to begin the evacuation. Controls were set to automatic and secured. When the last had left, the commander, turned to the figure and spoke again.&#8221; I was wondering if you would return here again&#8221;.
<br />
<br />His face turned to shock when the figure turned to face him. Not the one he thought to be here. Alarm was in his features. &#8220;Who are you, what do you want?&#8221;. Invisibly, two chairs were pulled over and the figure sat in on and motioned for the commander to sit in the other.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Commander Indy, I am here to check up on you and to relay a message to you from your Master&#8221; The figure spoke, voice calm and level. &#8220;My name is Darth Neo_Kuja, and I serve my Lord, Master sycho_warrior&#8221; a pause to let the information sink in, &#8220; I bring you a message that I was instructed to deliver personally and in the form given&#8221;. A smile came across Neo_Kuja&#8217;s face.
<br />A laugh was heard from the sith and a scream of pain and anguish from the commander. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Han was dealing so badly with the situation, that Locutus had to threaten to blow up the Falcon to get his attention. &#8220;Come on, you going with me&#8221; Locutus said. He grabbed Hans hand and yanked him up and onto his shoulders. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Put me down you flea bitten has been&#8221;. Han said, a little anger in the voice, but no fight. He had no fight in him for a long time. Locutus carried him to the lift and down into the hanger and up the ramp into the Star Princess. After strapping Han in, he started up the ship and lifted off. Once out of the hanger, he set course for space. It too a bit, but he had the coordinates set for the jump into hyperspace. To the planet of Naboo.  To the one place that was safe to travel to. 
<br />
<br />A day and a half travel brought them to the planet. A beautiful view from orbit. Clear skies where the would be going. The north country, to the estate of lea&#8217;s mother. He descended to a landing pad a short distance from the main house. The lake was as blue as ever . By now, he had Han up and walking. Locutus had guessed Han had resolved to go along peaceable.  The walk was not far, near the lake in fact. A small pavilion was erected there with a view of the whole lake, flowers surrounding the area. He led Han to the spot. &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this for your own good, Han, you&#8217;ve got to get this out of your system, here and now&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />He gestured to the ground, to the plaques of stone, that were engraved. &#8220;Here lies brother and sister, of the family Skywalker, Luke and Lea, Jedi Knights, defenders of the republic, died in battle. Luke survived by wife and son, Lea survived by husband, Han Solo. Han broke down at this and wept. His anger, resentment all came to a head, here and now. Locutus knelt by his friend, a hand on his shoulder. The pain shared now and lessened for Han, for his friend. They would remain as long as needed. As long as Han needed. Locutus knew Han would survive and that he would want to take another trip soon. It was ok and he was prepared for that journey. 
<br />
<br />The Death Star bridge resumed the hectic schedule that it had. The commander acted as if nothing happened. No one spoke of the scar on his face and neither did he. The work would continue till the station was complete, no more failures allowed. Two more personnel transports dropped out of hyper space. These were additional workers from Geonosis. This would help to step up the pace that was now expected of them. Indy was not about to suffer another visit from the Sith. 
<br />
<br />Supply transports also picked up the pace, delivering supply needed to build the mammoth structure. Key components were delivered as well. Gravity generators, deck guns, anti-ship batteries and more. The Main weapon was almost complete as well. This station, once complete would truly be the ultimate power in the universe. It was twice the size of the original Death Star. A fearsome site it would be when it was put into action. To overwhelm a target with shear mass. The gravitational fields would be disrupted as well. Mush terror would be accomplished with the reports spreading from planet to planet. That would bring the systems into line quickly.

That way it can be made to read nicely rather than being interrupted by lots of small posts/requests etc etc.

<br />Don't post back unless you disagree strongly......cause otherwise it could have to be pruned before its even done! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Supply transports also picked up the pace, delivering supply needed to build the mammoth structure. Key components were delivered as well. Gravity generators, deck guns, anti-ship batteries and more. The Main weapon was almost complete as well. This station, once complete would truly be the ultimate power in the universe. It was twice the size of the original Death Star. A fearsome site it would be when it was put into action. To overwhelm a target with shear mass. The gravitational fields would be disrupted as well. Mush terror would be accomplished with the reports spreading from planet to planet. That would bring the systems into line quickly. 
<br />
<br />The waves stormed Tipoca City on Komino as always. An awesome site to see if you have never been there. All troops had been transported to the Super Star destroyer. The Dark Master made his way to the creation facilities. A bridge gave a view down into the area. Troops of different ages, drilling, learning, all obedient. She would see to that. She was to meet with the administrator in moments. Lama Su was still the Prime Minister. He had served the previous Dark Lord well. Though, in the beginning, he had known that it was a Dark Lord who was behind the orders. He did not care. He just wanted to be paid and have their work appreciated by others. They took great pride in their work after all. 
<br />
<br />Troops turning in precision drill, snapped in the turn and continued. The Dark Master continued his course to the meeting. A special task to have done, one that must be carried out, alone. Ths would have to be carefully done. It would be dangerous if the Jedi got wind of the plans that were laid out. They would do all to stop her, at any cost. But, the rewards of success, well, they were worth the risk. 
<br />
<br />Jagged was on the bridge, the ship was ready to get under way, but was delayed because of who was still down on the planet. He wanted nothing more than to get this mission over with. Having to deal with the Admiral was one thing, but the other, was not. He received the report that all was secured for the hyperspace jump. &#8220;Hold here for the time being, Lieutenant. &#8220; A curious glance was all that was seen. They were filled to the brim with troops and needed to unload them as soon as possible. Crew members were doubled up in quarters to accommodate the extras. He had voiced his complaint, but was told to hold his peace, it was orders.
<br />
<br />The scanning officer reported a craft leaving the surface and headed thier way. It would be docked in less than five minuets. Jagged acknowledged it. He still could not give the order until told to do so. He would wait. 
<br />
<br />The senate forum was now abuzz. The Jedi had presented thier reports. Conditions in the galaxy were deteriating. The report from Jedi Master Esquilax was also relayed. It was alarming to say the least. It was a warning of impending disaster, if not dealt with rapidly. There were many calls for answers. The Chancellor tried to get order restored. With much effort, a calm was restored. It was put that a vote would be delayed until the next day, so a plan of defense could be found. The Jedi present, agreed. 
<br />
<br />Gowserpaul and Gowserchris where in the meditation chamber when the others returned. They lowered the lighting as the others entered. Each found a place and sat. Each had a preference and found the level of peace with no distractions. The one Master Yoda had trained Luke with. Each had concerns, but they were set aside for the time and the group. The clarity was amazing. Each could see the approach of a cloud, but it was still a ways off. They saw two, hooded and robed. They had the manifestation of the dark side. What they were doing, no one could see. They did see the faces and alarm spread, but the vision held. The anger was seen as well. 
<br />
<br />Several hours later, Esquilax briefed the others on what he knew and the scouting reports that were coming in. It gave them and edge, but, not the upper hand. Unless they moved quickly and carefully, a repeat of Darth Sidious would occur. That would be disastrous for the galaxy. There were too few Jedi. About one hundred at present, half of those were padawans. They needed a lot more training. There were still those to be found. The brothers would deal with that issue. Wizard approached Esquilax to speak with him. &#8220;It is difficult to believe that it is Carla we are up against. &#8220;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know what you mean&#8221; replied Esquilax, &#8220;I believed her dead as the others did&#8221;. The Star Destroyer, or at least the one Carla was suppose to have been aboard was destroyed, pieces spread over a sector. An internal explosion was what did it in. No remains were ever recovered when the salvage teams searched. They scraped all the material they could to melt down to build new items and ships. But, no life forms were recovered. Strange indeed.
