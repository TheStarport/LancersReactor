			<div class="content">What is Crossfire?
<br />
<br />Crossfire is the most complex mod for Freelancer. It was designed to show what possibilities and features are still possible in Freelancer.
<br />Crossfire has very advanced graphic &amp; sound settings which will make the gameplay much more interesting. The gameplay is very balanced and challenging.
<br />Additionally you will able to explore over 60 additional systems with more than 100 dockable stations and planets. Clans are able to buy their own clansystems and manage those like they want.
<br />There are high profitable traderoutes which change due a dynamic economy. Also the world of Crossfire is changing alot since the mod is build to create random events such as invading Nomads and Dom'kavash or solar interferences which disturb the travel in some systems. Crossfire is an expanding world that is always in development. New systems appear and can get explored. New ships are build. New equipment is going to be developed. Everything is changing to guarantee a long time of pleasure and action.
<br />The Crossfire mod comes along with very special featues which isn't very surprising because since years it is the Crossfire mod and its development team which introduced a very high amount of new features and concepts to the Freelancer community.
<br />
<br />The Crossfire server (24/7 SWAT Crossfire) is one of the most active Freelancer Servers out there. It is a very cool RP server with various of the traditional Roleplay types such as being Police, Pirate, Trader, Smuggler, Merc or Military. Beside this traditional Roleplay the Crossfire server offers another very big and favorite Roleplay variation called ASF vs CSF. Two opposing factions which fight each other at all costs. The server automatically notices roleplay activities and calculates the scores between those factions. Depending on how the fights did develop it is possible that the systems automatically change their ownership from ASF to CSF or from CSF to ASF.
<br />
<br />The Crossfire mod itself comes along with the most advanced cheat protection that has been developed for Freelancer. Also our serversided tools are very special and offer many new features for the players.
<br />It doesn't surprise that the last version of Crossfire has been downloaded more than 32.000 times on the SWAT Portal and about 75.000 times on Lancersreactor so far.

<br />
<br />Storyline:
<br />
<br /> Chapter 1
<br />
<br />A few months ago a Rheinland explorer found a new Jumpgate to a hidden system in Omicron Alpha. When they entered this system the first time they were shocked. It was the main reason for the rising Nomad activities in the whole Sirius sector. Containing one planet and over 20 Jumpgates to Nomad systems, Liberty systems, Borderworld systems and many unknown systems it's a major threat for all houses. Rheinland, Liberty, Kusari and Bretonia decided to send their fleets to get this system under their control. But the nomads were already waiting for them... hundreds of ships got destroyed and the whole Kusari fleet is still missing after they were chasing a Nomad battleship. But finally it was a victory and the Nomads had to leave. Because of this massive fight above the planet it is now called Crossfire. A few weeks after this important victory the houses decided to colonize the unknown systems. But because of the Outcast in the neighbourhood these stations and planets are under permanent attack.
<br />
<br />Chapter 2
<br />
<br />Incoming transmission from the Kusari Fleet: &quot;We are under attack by nomad forces... we need help our position is 12.*)&quot;&#167;12*33... who ever can hear this please help us&quot; The Kusari Fleet is still out there and under attack by nomad battleships and gunboats. The Fleets spread out to find a hidden system called Death Valley and to rescue the Kusari. Meanwhile in the Nephele System a new Sleepership was found which looks the same way the old alliance sleeperships looked like. Scientists entered the wreck to explore it and to have a look at the ship database. &quot;Russian language?!?!... it's a coalition ship&quot;
<br />
<br />Chapter 3
<br />
<br />The nomad battle: Even with reinforcements coming to Death valley the Kusari are not able to destroy the Nomad armada... the fights already last several weeks now. Only a single Kusari fighter has found a way through the blockade in Death Valley and managed to deliver a disk which was found in an unknown wreck to the security forces on Planet Crossfire. Local scientist analize the datafiles now. The Sleepership: This ship has a coalition origin.. but what is it doing here? It is allready a few hundred years old and it seems like it got attacked. Maybe the database is showing more information and maybe some guys in the new systems have heard some rumours.
<br />
<br />Chapter 4
<br />
<br />A way to our old home, the earth, has been found again but there is no life anymore. The colonies are destroyed, earth is empty and everything looks like the nomads have something to do with it. The houses try to recolonize the sol system now and find out what has been going on. Maybe the databases of the old science centers on earth can tell us more about the history of sol and where the missing coalition fleet is.
<br />
<br />Chapter 5
<br />
<br />The Coalition, we never thought that we would see them again but we were wrong. Before Earth got destroyed they managed to launch their three sleeperships. Two of them have found their way to the Altair sector and now we are at war with them again. Will this never end?
<br />
<br />Chapter 6
<br />
<br />The return of the Dom'Kavash was a heavy strike back for the Coalition and the houses of Sirius. The Dom'Kavash territory is growing with the support of the Nomads and Coalition is close to a destruction. Nobody knows where those ships come from or how to survive their attacks. We have only one chance... forget the rivalities of the past and unite with the Coalition and fight together. This is the only way to survive the biggest threat that the mankind has seen.
<br />
<br />Chapter 7
<br />
<br />Not long ago a giant fleet of Coalition ships broke through a heavy Dom'Kavash blockade and discovered a hidden hypergate. A large group of fighters entered this hypergate but never returned. What is on the other side? This is a question that hardly can be answered. All tries to through failed and Dom'Kavash motherships constantly jump through this gate to Altair. Only the united forces of the houses and the coalition might be able to find out what is going on there.

<br />
<br />
<br />Ragnarok Gunship
<br />
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret/Special Mounts: 6/2/1
<br />Armor: 12600
<br />Cargo Space: 360
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 71/71
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 9
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The 'Ragnarok' is a ship that blends the lines between Gunboat and Fighter. It is an Esthar design, a workhorse vessel designed to carry equipment and cargo; It's two huge engines producing a massive amount of thrust, and it's variable geometry giving it unparalleled manevuering for a ship of it's class. However, it's heavy armour, potent weapon systems and trademark gauss rifle lend it more than mere survivability, it can duke it out with the best of them and lend serious firepower to any wing or fleet it flies with. As a result this ship excels in a Command vessel role, capable of staying at the back of the fray lending punishing firepower without flinching.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Shroud
<br />Guns/Turrets: 6/0
<br />Armor: 9700
<br />Cargo Holds: 130
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 65/65
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />Local scientists have found the plans of several historical ships. One of these Ships was the light fighter Shroud. It was not possible to decode all information about the historical weapons, engines and thrusters because somehow parts of these plans got lost. Therefore some engineers came with the idea to mount modern VHF equipment on this ship. The result is a very agile and deadly fighter.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />KuM &quot;Komodo Dragon&quot; Very Heavy Fighter
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/2
<br />Armor: 12100
<br />Cargo Space: 100
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 80/80
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />After the Nomad Wars, the Border World pirates began taking adcantage of the weakened state of the House police and military forces. Already under constant bombardement from the Blood Dragons and Golden Chrysanthemums, the Kusari Military drew upon the technology of some of their defeated invaders, and produced a new fighter to keep their economy and citizens safe.
<br />
<br />The Komodo Dragon, just like its namesake, has a ferocious bite that will inflict certain death. Six forward-firing weapons and two 360 degree-firing turrets make sure of that. Powerful engines and good blancing keep the controls light, despited its bulk. All this combined with a generous cargo hold, make this a ship prepared not only to go into any battle, but also to stay and hold the front lines for as long as needed.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;CSV&quot; Combat Service Vehicle
<br />Gun/Turret: 2/1
<br />Armor: 3200
<br />Cargo Space: 100
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 34/34
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 6
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 8
<br />Additional Equipment: CM
<br />
<br />Combat Service Vehicle (CSV)\n\nThe CSV is a ship specific to the Junkers and the Hogosha. Not generally considered a huge threat, it is used in their nearly continuous search for more salvage.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Soulforge Train
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret: 0/6
<br />Armor: 10500
<br />Cargo Space: 5000
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 100/100
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: N/A
<br />Max. Weapon Class: N/A
<br />Additional Equipment: none
<br />
<br />The Train is used to transport large amounts of cargo aroud the houses of Sirius. Its vast hold is counterset by its poor defensive and manovrebility during flight, which means that although profit margins during trading are high... so are the risks of running the trade routes.
<br />

<br />
<br />Wolverine
<br />Guns/Turrets: 6/1

<br />Hades\n\n\nLocal scientists have found the plans of several historical ships. One of these Ships was the Hades Bomber. It was not possible to decode all information about the historical weapons, engines and thrusters because somehow parts of these plans got lost. Therefore some engineers came with the idea to mount modern VHF equipment on this ship. The result is a new sort of ship, the first pure torpedo bomber.
<br />

<br />Deimos
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 6/1

<br />
<br />M13 Class &quot;Deimos&quot; Corsair Very Heavy Fighter\n\n\nShortly after a Corsair expedition found the drawings and the wreck of this old fighter on Planet Pygar, production commenced in Tripoli Shipyard. Until now, only one ship has been produced by the original drawings, and analyses shows thats this ship was not designed inside Sirius, and can be the remains after a Coalition experimental ship that landed on Planet Pygar with the drawings shortly after pursuing the Hispania sleeper ship. The ship performs beyond any Sirius-disigned ship, with extreme armor and power rating, great cargo space and fabulous offensive and defensive capabilities. This ship is shortly: the Real One.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />StarBlazer
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 4/0
<br />Armor: 2600
<br />Cargo Holds: 50
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 21/21
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 3
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 5
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM
<br />The StarBlazer is a new Liberty prototype which gives average firepower and fast movement for a small price.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Strike Carrier
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 0/25
<br />Armor: 200000
<br />Cargo Holds: 1000000
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 99/99
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 9
<br />Additional Equipment: CM, CD/T(2)
<br />
<br />The most impressive warship ever constructed, this Ship carries more firepower than some entire battlegroups from previous eras. Extremely large and heavy armed, it is a proto-typical strike carrier, self-sufficient, self-sustaining, and able to wreak havoc on enemy forces. Even with the guns alone, it can simultaneously engage several cruisers worth of firepower, and come out alive.
<br />The new 100k Carrier shield prototype gives additional protection to this very slow Ship.
<br />

<br />
<br />Juni's Defender
<br />
<br />Guns/Turret Mounts: 5/1
<br />Armor: 10600

<br />
<br />BDR-337 'Defender' Liberty Heavy Fighter
<br />'The best of the best,' this heavily outfitted rig represents the pinnacle of Liberty's technological advances and design savoir faire. With its elevated armor and power rating as standard and the additional mount of firepower, it's no wonder that this ship is the number one choice of the Liberty Armed Forces.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />07A &quot;Elite Defender&quot; Liberty Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/1
<br />Armor: 10800
<br />Cargo Space: 70
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 70/70
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />This ship is an advanced prototype from the ship engineers of Liberty. Liberty hierarchy were tired of getting beaten back by borderworld pirates and criminals as they tried to explore, so they put their collective heads together and came up with one of the most cutting edge ships in existance. Soon, the original defender will be a thing of the past, and the Elite Defender will make it's mark.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />J10P - 15P &quot;Draconji&quot; Kusari Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/0
<br />Armor: 10800
<br />Cargo Space: 70
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 70/70
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />&quot;The Serpent's Might,&quot; this ship is the new might of Kusari military knowledge and technology. The Draconji is an answer to the evolution of the Dragon, and is advanced in every way.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />CTE 750AE-1P Civilian Starskipper
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 3
<br />Armor: 2200
<br />Cargo Space: 20
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 15/15
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 1
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 3
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM
<br />
<br />Manufactured in the heartland of Liberty, the new StarSkipper is the progression of Liberty's commitment to the civilian line. More nanobots, and shields, a thicker skin of armor are just a few of the new refinements to the trusty Starflier design, but with radical new styling, this ship is sure to be a hit!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Liberty Guardian VHF
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/1
<br />Armor: 11000
<br />Cargo Space: 70
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 70/70
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />Another remarkable attempt to &quot;even the odds&quot;, The Guardian can stand toe to toe with any fighter in Sirius. Liberty Shipwrights have created a force to be considered by any pirate, no matter his ship.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />RSM-15r &quot;Gunstar&quot; Rheinland Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/1
<br />Armor: 11500
<br />Cargo Space: 80
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 68/68
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />As the Rheinland shipwrights deviate from the standard form and function of their fighters, they are realizing greater and greater gains in performance, and power. Not as pretty a sight as the Valkyre, but far more deadly in the hands of Rheinland's forces.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />FRL-96z Liberty &quot;Interloper&quot; Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turrets Mounts: 4/0
<br />Armor: 7100
<br />Cargo Space: 60
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 43/43
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 6
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 8
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />Designed out of necessity, rather than want, the Interloper was born as a heavy scout class, that sacrifices 1 gun, and 1 turret for more armor, while retaining its agility. It can scout areas that light fighters wouldn't stand a chance in, and it does it in style. A great step forward for Liberty, and a hole in their technology tree plugged.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />GTz-&quot;Enfilade&quot; Pirate Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/1
<br />Armor: 12600
<br />Cargo Space: 70
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 71/71
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />This ship was made to give the inner worlds pirates an edge over the new technology showing up from the major houses and corporations, and it does it's job well. Massive hull, full compliment of guns, and all the extras make this ship a frightening force in Sirius.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Independant &quot;Rage Bringer&quot; Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/1
<br />Armor: 12600
<br />Cargo Space: 75
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 77/77
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Independant designed Rage Bringer was created to stem the flow of red ink for the traders, and corporations. Too many losses were being incurred due to the ever growing strength of pirates, so the Rage Bringer was born. It is a big, yet sleek ship, with loads of power, guns, and armor, which makes it a deadly foe indeed.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Corporation &quot;Silverfish&quot; Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turret Mounts: 6/1
<br />Armor: 10450
<br />Cargo Space: 80
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 63/63
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Silverfish is a corporate defense fighter, and also an offensive weapon when scouting new fields or systems for resources. It has everything a combat pilot could want, and some that a merchant wouldn't mind, either. It has an increased cargo bay, but a little less armor.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />BR-11 &quot;Marauder&quot; Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turrets Mounts: 5/0
<br />Armor: 6200
<br />Cargo Space: 45
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 43/43
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 6
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 8
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Bretonia Marauder is the newest from Bretonia's ship engineers. It deviates from the rounded, plump design to a sleeker, more efficient and hard to hit design. It is only in limited testing now, and she is proving herself so far. Good agility, good armor, smaller hold, make this ship worth flying.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Ceptyr Very Heavy Fighter
<br />
<br />Gun/Turrets Mounts: 6/0
<br />Armor: 12400
<br />Cargo Space: 70
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 70/70
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Ceptyr is a blend of the new and the old, combined to make a stout fighter, with sturdy yet sleek looks. The Ceptyr is a powerful fighter, in the hands of a good pilot. Engineered and designed by Baene.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Civilian &quot;Scourge&quot; VHF
<br />
<br />Gun/Turrets Mounts: 6/0
<br />Armor: 12000
<br />Cargo Space: 75
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 70/70
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Scourge creates yet another example of the innovation and drive of the civilian engineers. Not satisfied with limiting pilots to the Eagle, they created the Scourge as a viable alternative. It is bulkier than it's brother, but flies remarkably well, and fights like the devil, making this ship a sure bet in the hands of a good pilot. As a side note, it also handles a decent bit of cargo, making it a profitable ship as well.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Independant &quot;Seething Fury&quot; VHF
<br />
<br />Gun/Turrets Mounts: 6/0
<br />Armor: 11000

<br />
<br />The Shifter is an odd looking ship, but was VERY effective in all field tests thus-far. Being that the cockpit is mounted side-saddle, the theory behind it was to &quot;fake&quot; enemy pilots, and cause them to miss shots, which it did well. Rumors abound of an upgraded, two-man VHF version of the Shifter 1 coming soon!

<br />
<br />It's not much known about this new ship... which is mostly because not many pilots survived their first contact this powerful and agile fighter. \nSurvivors reported that this are short range fighters which operate from big strike carriers.

<br />The Rheinland Battleship is one of the most dangerous ships all over Sirius. This shipclass has proven its power and many heavy battles. Those ships usually can be found in Rheinland but because of the nomad thread and due to financial problems the Rheinland government decided to release the plans for those ships to public companies.

<br />The Kusari Battleship is the heart of the Kusari fleet. Only the most honourable captains will ever get the chance to command one of those ships.

<br />After the plans for several old Alliance ships were found in the Database of a Coalition Sleepership the engineers were able to unlock a part of the ship database containing plans for this mighty Battleship. Our history database showed that the original Reliant got destroyed at the beginning of the Coalition war. Its captain provocated an collision with a coalition destroyer to protects his men and thousands of civilians. It seemed to be a good decision to name this shipclass after the famous Reliant of the Coalition war.

<br />
<br />The Hornet is build on Hamburg by an independant Company called Exa-Industries. In fact this is a very good ship, only its hull seems to be a little bit too weak.

<br />Troop Carrier
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 2/4

<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD
<br />
<br />This small Troop Carrier once was used to transport large groups of civilists to colonize new planets. Nowadays this job has been taken over by Battleships and Luxury Liners which is a much more comfortable way of travel for the passengers. The old Troop Carrier is now used by small private companies to transport all kind of commodities.

<br />Nexus
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 4/1

<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 25/25
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 6
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 7
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Nexus originally was designed to be a support unit for heavy battles where big repair ships are easy targets. Its small size would have been perfect for repairing battleships while they are still being attacked. Due to technical problems this idea has been dropped and the ship design was altered to a light fighter. The Nexus has one big advantage towards other light fighters: the original powergenerator which delivers a high amount of energy to all ship systems.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Cobra
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 6/0
<br />Armor: 9500

<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 67/67
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Cobra is a very solid build fighter. Its core powersupply and the centralized weapon systems are a very dangerous answer to upcomming attacks. The Cobra can deal with nearly all threats and is more than just agile. The place where these ships have been produced is still unknown.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Raptor
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 6/0

<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 69/69
<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Raptor is a prey with very good abilities. It has enough power to be dangerous enough to mess with a battleship. Heavy guns, good agility and its powersource are the reason why this ship belongs to the 'top dogs' in Sirius.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Geko
<br />

<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Geko is a very heavy fighter that has been optimized for fights but not for carrying cargo. It has a strong hull and a good behaviour in fights but its nearly useless if it is use to transport cargo.
<br />
<br />

<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />

<br />Max. Weapon Class: 8
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD
<br />
<br />The V-Fighter, amedium fighter that was designed for small raids against pirates and Lane Hackers. It turned out to be a good ship against other medium fighters used around the house systems of Sirius. The design is simple but effective.
<br />

<br />Exocet
<br />
<br />Guns/Turrets: 4/0

<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 9
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Exocet is a medium fighter with very good short range abilities. Its heavy guns and overdimensional powergenerator makes this ship a very good choice for small raids or defending bases.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />Optimal Weapon Class: 8
<br />Max. Weapon Class: 10
<br />Additional Equipment: M, CM, CD/T
<br />
<br />The Mirage-X is based on the design of the original alliance Mirage. The task was to maximize the firepower but the result was a loss of agility due to the heavy guns and the powergenerator.
<br />
<br />

<br />The Midnight Hammer battleship class is build somewhere in Kusari space. The exact place is not known. The CSF soon found out that this ship is very valueable and even able to be a danger to ASF's Cerberus class. Even if the design is different from the Cerberus the main components of both ships seem to have the same origin.
