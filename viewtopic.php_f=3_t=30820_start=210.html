			<div class="content">Some more ideas:
<br />- Be able to buy more than one ship, or a way to transfer cash from one account to another (so you can trade, fight, explore, etc. without having to buy another ship every time).
<br />- More commodities and contraband (more than just Cardamine and Artifacts)
<br />- A way to customize your ship without having to modify the ini files (think of purchasable or importable skins, customizable bodies for your ship, customizable wings, whatever)
<br />- The ability to get a reputation on a battleship. Like if you're friendly with a certain faction, you could do loads of jobs for them, and help people with tasks on the battleship. You could slowly become a commander and take control over the battleship (just an idea <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />- Better mining (think of a mining vessel you could control to drill holes into large asteroids in asteroid fields, that'd be cool)
<br />- be able to purchase a train
<br />- be able to become a pirate and tax CPU's offline
<br />- black holes !</div>

			<div class="content">I don't know if this idea was posted but it would be awsome if Freelancer 2 had the Domcavatch (spelling unsure) return.  And if they teamed up with the nomads in order to become the dominat powers again.  I also suggest that the hyper gates be unlocked.  So that instead of having Just the serious system to travel in we should have the univIerse.  It'll be also interesting if the players were able to fly Gunboats, Cruisers, battleships, transports, trains, and even fleets.  It'll be realy cool if the players could control a entire fleet, consisting of 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, 3 gunboats, and 6 fighters.  And I also wish the see cloaking devices that cloak the ship from NPC.  BUT to be completly visible to other players durring Multiplayer.  I also wish that the main characters remain the same.  If there is a mod for some of the things listed above, E-mail me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Lancecho009@yahoo.com">Lancecho009@yahoo.com</a><!-- e -->

And have some sort of station editor, something that lets you design your companies bases.  Then you pay Daunman to build your base over time and when it's opperational your neural net accounts gains and looses money with the trade on the base.  You would have to pay the workers, maybe protect your base.  You should be able to hire someone like Universal Shipping to make your trade runs for you.  Also, you should be able to place orders for material, set your own prices for things, etc.  Just my personal idea.  I do wish that MS would make a FL2...</div>

			<div class="content">Seems alot of you are getting a bit crazy with the home ownership, taxation, first person shooter RPG supergame ideas. I say leave freelancer pretty much how it is in terms of inclusion of features(simplicity was what drew us close remember, if we all were so dissapointed we wouldnt be here on these forums in hopes of another Freelancer), just revamp certain elements of gameplay for the sequel.
<br />
<br />The most important addition is of course dynamic universe gameplay, not just trade and commodity pricing but economic indicators of certain factions. If one faction has an abundance of resources they will produce more ships and ensure safer travel through their space or be able to further faction agendas. Say the Corsairs are helped by a player (balance should be preserved until the player helps out the faction in combat battles or trade) and the number of ships grows large enough or number of enemy ships small enough for them the expand into another sector, say a Rheinland sector. The game will spawn not only the corsair ships but a Rheinland police and or military to try to decimate the faction power of the Corsairs pushing the back to their home space. If they were to get into New Berlin or a neighboring system, cap ships would spawn in response. This is just an example of many outcomes that would be possible with this system that is not beyond current gaming technology.
<br />
<br />Something that I've found is really fun in most games was implemented in a way but not really used in Freelancer I. The news system was pretty much static in the first game. With a new economic system you could get updates/news blurbs on how current factions are faring in space. Also some random events could pop up, like maybe the Kursari economy flourishes with the installment of a new president, which will add temporary bonuses to Kursari trade. Another thing would be faction status, becomming a member could gain you military rankings, discounts, possibly different greetings in bars for higher ups. And last maybe hubs for planets and stations in third person walking mode for planetary businesses(bar, ship dealer, landing dock, other), nothing fancy like an FPS but just a small hub to explore, chat with npcs and maybe find some other cool stuff. 
<br />
<br />As for other things probably just the obvious, missions(patrol,cargo especially, and faction specific specials through exclusive listings for different ranks), new ships, weaps, systems, player customization, ejection, ect. I actually recommend against the orbiting planets because of the way Freelancer is set up, this would only complicate things in the long run, it is after all just a game. Spinning planets and a day/night cycle for planetary hubs could help to create the illusion and would be a better option.
<br />
<br />If anyone were ever to read this from DA, I don't care what you do as long as you develope the story line and sub plots and don't leave Sirrius. I'm dying to find out if Planetform came clean about their operations, if Daumann ever pays for their crimes and Rheinland gets out of poverty, and if the Corsairs ate any more of their people. Just answer those questions and I'll be happy.

			<div class="content">The greatest/most valuable improvements IMHO would be:
<br />1. More realistic physical universe.
<br /> a Orbiting full scale planets in physically realistic star systems
<br /> b Navigate star systems using at least psuedo realistic real space vectoring [this    
<br />     doesn't have to be complicated for the end user - just point and click way 
<br />     points that automatically calculate approach vectors for moving objects 
<br />     including planets and stations etc. 
<br /> c Enter atmospheres and navigate planet surfaces for bases [again this could be 
<br />     point  and click/ goto system - but with the option for free flight
<br />
<br />2. Improved NPC universe
<br /> a Dynamic, changing and influencable political, commercial and cultural  
<br />     demographics
<br /> b Ability to interact with, ally with, trade with, hire, fire and organise NPCs
<br /> c Improved commercial system as a part of the above two points.
<br /> d Non linear storylines. Less prescriptive/free will limiting missions
<br />
<br />3. Improved PC development 
<br /> a Design initial character
<br /> b Ability to own/build capital ships, bases and stations, 
<br />     build fleets (both military and commercial) and give them missions to fulfil.
<br /> c Ability to influence politics and take part in diplomacy and war, 
<br />     conquer systems, ally systems, own systems, build empires as well as 
<br />     wander around as a lone trader in a scrap bucket.
<br />
<br />A BIG ask, however, imagine the possibilities...unlimited adventure.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p373843" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I like Freelancer's simplicity, and so in recommending (probably to no effect) what I'd like to see in FL2, I'd like to keep a lot of that.  There are lot's of ideas here for extended character development, such as joining factions, having charisma, wisdom, etc...  
<br />
<br />But Freelancer is an RPG-Lite game.  It's meant to be accessible to everybody, with action at its core; the developers mentioned that they wanted players to sit down and start lighting up the skies, and that's exactly what they've achieved.
<br />
<br />That said, I, like most folks here,  desperately want to own more than one ship.  It's too limiting to go buy a freighter (250 cargo) to make a couple of runs for $$ and then have to fly back to *insert spoiler here* to pick up a Titan again.  And then I've got to stow all my turrets until next time I have a freighter.
<br />
<br />And I'd like to have wingmen, though the game is called Freelancer.  I want to belong to a group.  I want interaction on the planets, too--maybe even meeting with my buddies in bars.  And it would be nice to take out bases...
<br />
<br />So, a whole mess of these things can be solved very simply...  Microsoft, please be listening...  And the answer is.......   Faction.  That's it.  Why aren't I, Trent, a faction?  
<br />
<br />People and NPC's could join my faction.  I could shoot up a base, now it's in my faction.  When I land at a base controlled by ME, there's one extra option on that menu bar where I can repair, replace defense turrets, create missions (paid out of my pocket), and set prices/inventory.  
<br />
<br />It's all seems so simple!  Suddenly, after the single player campaign ends, I still have goals; I need to buy/sell/scrounge for guns and commodities to sell.  I need to defend my various bases from rival factions.  I need to hire people, or save their tails to get them into my faction.
<br />
<br />It increases the communication in the 'living universe'--I would have a message tab, where I can see who is doing what to me and my faction members/allies, etc.  And it gives me a real stake in things, even without the continued storyline.  Right now, I feel more like &quot;what now?&quot; since I have nothing to really shoot for.  I can make money, but that's it.  Give me stuff I can claim, and then make me defend it, and the game comes to life.
<br />
<br />And with the small multiplayer size, factions are perfect!!!  We can essentially be trying to build mini-empires, vying with one another!  And yet, no simplicity is lost.
<br />So that's my big idea.  
<br />
<br />Unrelated additional wish list items
<br />On an unrelated note, after the SP game is over, it would be nice if, like, every 100ish missions, I ran into a character for a random mission.  Make it feel like the game wasn't &quot;over.&quot;  And planet's need more than one docking ring--what, is there only 1 major city per planet?  AND  Ever heard of supply and demand?  Would it be so hard to change prices?  It seems illogical that I can run a freighter full of diamonds on a single North/South run over and over and over and over, and make an enourmous profit every time! Grr.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p374109" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">It was nice to see some fine ideas but what I really want in
<br />free lancer2 is-
<br />
<br />More and Different celestial objects- like-
<br />
<br />A binary star(one with a red giant and the other a black hole sucking it dry)
<br />
<br />Radio galaxies.
<br />
<br />Quasars.
<br />
<br />MOre graphics to the stars, like if we go near the stars we can see it
<br />bubbling with magnetic rings and things like that.
<br />
<br />Systems which are still young like hot planets and a prototype sun.
<br />
<br />___
<br />More realistic physics, Like for heaven sakes a spaceship dosen't
<br />stop if you turn off your engines, this isn't a damn car on 
<br />a free way like you take your foot off the gas and it stops.
<br />Newtons second law of motion, the inertial law to be exact.
<br />
<br />And adding fuel to the ships reactor, engines and ship hull
<br />degraging with time due to fatigue and usage, not to mention food
<br />for trent flying the ship all this time.
<br />___
<br />
<br />And other have already touched on subjects like trade lanes and
<br />junp gate tolls landing on planets surface manually and space suits
<br />etc..etc..
<br />
<br />
<br />As for the story line freelancer was good except for the last bit,
<br />a jump hole appearing and the nomads sucked into it?? what the f()ck
<br />was that?? digital anvil trying to keep up with schedule?? I almost
<br />couldn't believe after all that nice story of being on the run
<br />from system to system then suddenly, ZAP!!! they got sucked!! 
<br />end of story!! That's microsoft for you , they screw up some where.
<br />
<br />But for FL2 if it were ever coming out I would love to see Donqawash
<br />returing with their pets the nomads to reclaim what was theirs.
<br />
<br />So the story line could go like this-
<br />
<br />It has been 6 years since the Freeport-7 incident
<br />The order having won the battle of the Dyson sphere make the city inside
<br />it their main base of operations. What they would find inside the city
<br />would change mankind forever, For it contained technology which man could
<br />not even dream of, but for the things the order could find the main tech
<br />they would lay their hands on are the blue prints on hypergates.  But there
<br />was no need to build one since the dyson sphere itself was housing one there,
<br />(since hype gates require enormous energy the only way to get that sort of
<br />power is through the dyson sphere, so the dyson sphere was constructed to
<br />power the hyper gate). It took the order 6 whole years to learn to operate 
<br />the one in it.. and when they did only then the pieces of puzzle started to fall
<br />in place.
<br />
<br />The donqawash weren't extinct as they thought they were and neither did the nomads
<br />planning to exterminate the humans as the order thought. The donqawash sent the 
<br />nomads (their creations) far and wide to find advanced civilisations to help them
<br />in THEIR CAUSE. The donquawash who left sirius in a hurry had good reasons to do so.
<br />
<br />The nomads were ambassadors who were intent on rallying support but having studied
<br />the colonies the nomads came to a decision that the internal discord was too great
<br />to suite any purpose and decided to infiltrate every major colony's head of state 
<br />finally in the hope of uniting them.The weapon of mass destruction hoax and 
<br />escalation was a means to bring
<br />every head of state under one roof and then they planned to 'plant the seed'.Even the chancellors
<br />decision of the war on kusari was because due to the end of their influence on kusari
<br />political structure because of the assasinations of the blood dragons and the death of 
<br />Tekagi.But their supposidly 'good intentions' backfired when the order knew about them 
<br />and foiled their plan. 
<br />
<br />So what was their cause? Why did the nomads plan to unite the colonies? Why did the
<br />Donquawash welcome the order when they finally activated the hypergate.
<br />
<br />For long before man evolved and even before the donquawash existed 'The Ultimate war'
<br />'the war of existance' was being fought between factions for reasons which even some
<br />of them couldn't understand. The 3 major factions fighting for dominance of their physics,
<br />their time and space were fighting a do or die battle for eons. 
<br />
<br />Leading one faction were the donqawash's allies who like many on this side of the
<br />universe were life which evolve from simple beings to intelligent life forms due to the
<br />simple property of bonding of atoms known as carbon with other substances.
<br />
<br />The other faction were beings which shouldn't even be called life as they were
<br />beings composed of pure energy which the physics the humans know.. don't even support
<br />such an existance who feel threatened by the carbon based life forms and the unknowns.
<br />Although many other donquawash's allies speculate that the quasars might be the home for
<br />these life forms making them fully compatible with the basic physical structure of this
<br />universe.
<br />
<br />
<br />The last faction, the beings/intelligent anamolies as the donqawash's allies call them
<br />are the least understood. Their very existance breaks every physical fabric of the known
<br />universe. The carbonoids (donquawash's allies) fear them as the plague caused fear among
<br />the populace of the medieval europe. They come and consume entire star clusters and galaxies
<br />along with their systems into their darkness. Where ever they went darkness follows them. No one knows 
<br />what is their purpose in this universe. As they replace light with infinite darkness it 
<br />spreads fear among the carbonoids and the electronoids (name coined by the coalition for 
<br />the 'energy people'). The coalition simply calls them intelligent anamolies 'The Unknowns'.
<br />
<br />YES!! THE COALITION!! When the coalition won the war and bought the solarsystem under a single
<br />rule the nomads who had no trouble finding them.. quickly bought them to fight for their cause
<br />without the need of 'implanting seeds' as they did to the colonies.
<br />
<br />Although these were the main factions fighting for their very existance a fourth faction
<br />were beings formed mainly of silicon. They were only recently 
<br />discovered/stumbled by the carbonoids.Attempts to bring them under the aegis of the carbonoids
<br />has failed. They are highly irrational and underdeveloped compared to the carbonoids.
<br />
<br />With the noose tightning and the carbonoids fighting a losing battle against the unknowns the
<br />electronoids seem to have been holding off the unknowns for the moment as the presence of
<br />quasars at the edge of the darkness seems to suggest.With no time to spare to celebrate on 
<br />the reunion of the coalition with the colonies, 'The battle of the quasars' is on and
<br />the carbonoids find themselves fighting a two front war against the electronoids and the
<br />unknowns.

			<div class="content">ALso many people don't like the trade lane concept and they
<br />choose just jumping (like starlancer instead). I say lets
<br />have both, but if you jump you loose all your fuel
<br />in your fusion reactor, so the number of times of jumping 
<br />must be set ,for example 1-2 times for light fighters and
<br />4-5 times for very heavy ones. So in the end it's hard to
<br />dock with trade lanes and stuff but it is a hell of a lot
<br />economical.
<br />
<br />Also people suggest that their should be fps, well it
<br />should be but only to a limited extent like exploring
<br />strange planets with space suits.
<br />
<br />Also i'll give big NO to startrek type game in fl2.
<br />That would be the most stupidest thing. Hated that game
<br />'bridge commander' so much that I gave away that cd to a friend of 
<br />mine.
<br />
<br />Nice comments on my previous post, I'll post the reply later.

<br />visit militaryjets.tk and see beyond the horizon!</div>
