			<div class="content">Sometime since I were here last time!
<br />
<br />As I finished my last essay for school and have some free time now I played a bit FL in the last days (I know. I should go on modding, but I just want to relax now, sorry) <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I downloaded the newest version of Strails the Void Mod. For everyone new here: Strail took my Monkey mod v1.1 and some other mods (Real Space, etc.) and also made some of his own additions to create a Multiplayer mod called &quot;The Void&quot;. It is really a great piece of work and I especially like the New European systems he added.
<br />The Mod is still a Beta, but there are no bugs in it (I played it for about eight hours now and everything worked well) and there are already some clans and many players around.
<br />So, if you want to try MP (I did not play much MP before) or like to play the Monkeys online just download the Void Mod and see if you like it. It's really a good server with nice players there. I'm also there sometimes and my name is ... of course &quot;Black_Eagle&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I would really like to see some of you there and I think you will like it. The start is not very hard, as you start with a Piranha Bounty Hunter Light Fighter and 25,000 credits. So, see you there!
<br />
<br />Vader: Thanks, I'm allright. As I said school work is done for the next three days and therefore I'm quite happy to have some freetime. I think I will also mod a bit in the next day and not only play The Void. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Againh, I like the first part of your fan fiction very much and I'm waiting for the second part!
<br />So, the Patched version is working good so far. Very nice. It's good to hear that you like the new additions. You have to go to the new Robot system. It's much better than Nomad 1 (This one is really boring, but I was just starting system building there). I will improve Nomad 1 in the next version.
<br />For the battleships: I increased their strength to make it more challenging fighting them. But therefore you also get more for it, as the pilots and escape capsules are worth some money (Returning a battleship pilot will get you a really nice reward!!!)
<br />
<br />So, I hope you have fun with the mod. One thing: You said you wanted to fly around with Dreyus. Just come to the Void Server. There you could meet Dreyus, maybe King Lin and also me. It would be great to fly around with you guys! I hope to see you there.
<br />
<br />King Lin: I'm so sorry that your comp is getting crazy. It's really annoying, if you cannot play FL. I hope you will get this fixed or your Notebook will arrive soon.
<br />So, you still get crashes even after you reinstalled Windows? For the error with the FL CD. Do you have a friend, who also plays FL? Maybe you could install it with his CD and play with yours. Otherwise I would ask Digital Anvil or Microsoft, if they can give you a new CD. Normally they should do this for free.
<br />
<br />I hope you will be able to play FL again soon. It would also be great to see you on the Void server then!
<br />Good luck!
<br />
<br />Dreyus: It's really good to have you here on the forums Dreyus. Together with King Lin and Vader you are a great help and It's really good to have such a good support for my mod. Without you three and some others I would probably not go on with modding anymore. So many thanks to you again!!!
<br />
<br />So, here are my answers <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Limiting certain weapons to torpedo hardpoints is possible, but not a good solution, as there are too many ships with torpedo hardpoints. If I want to make weapons, which are unique to only one ore very few ships there is only one possibility. These weapons have to be invisible (not in space, but in your inventory menu. It is just to have them unmountable, because there is no other way to make them unmountable), not buyable and already on the ship, when you buy it.
<br />
<br />For the Nanobot thing: All NPCs from the colonies have a basic bats/bots usage setting. Only the Monkeys/Robots/Order and Nomads got an advanced one to use the bats/bots more cleverly. But somehow this did not work in the way I wanted. I will try to fix this. Thanks for the advice!
<br />
<br />I left the jumphole open, because it's a nice possibility to go to the borderworlds very early in the game. You have to be a good fighter to survive there, but if you can do so you will get a reward. You can buy better weapons and so on, as you said. For the Nomad torpedo and CD it is a great advantage, but you really need luck and many nanobots for this. And of course normally you need to find the Slaughterer wreck <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I agree with you that I have to strengthen the Nomad Battleship a bit.
<br />Getting friendly with the Nomads is not easy, but this is just realistic, as an alien race would not just meet you and say: Hi, here is all our great special equipment!&quot;
<br />But of course reality is less important than playability (I hope the word is right and you understand what I want to say). Therefore I'm thinking about adding one rep hacker for the Nomads. He will be on a new hidden base and it will cost you much money and you will get unfriendly with many factions (Okay this might sound too terrible, but I will not make it too hard).
<br />Until now, only killing the Order, the Robots or the Monkeys raises your reputation with the Nomads. Of course they are enemies of everyone, but if you would raise your rep with them killing any other faction it would just be too easy. And I also have the right story to explain this. In the colonies people have do not remember the Nomad War anymore, as they do not hear anything about them anymore. So they won't like you if you fight the Nomads and the Nomads won't like you if you fight the colonies, as they need the people to overtake them (like Tekagi). Only the Robots/Monkeys/Order, who is always fighting the Nomads chnages your rep.
<br />
<br />I thought about remaking some storyline areas. It is even possible to do this, without destroying or changing the SP campaign (I would just clone the systems and set them on the same place on the Navmap). But at first there are some other more important additions I want to do. Therefore it will take some time until I do this and maybe I just don't need this in the end. But we will see.
<br />
<br />For the bug with the storyline bases: I think this was already in original FL. But I might try to fix this.
<br />
<br />The Nomad torpedo and CD do not need these lines. So it's not a bug (The explanation would just be too long <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />One shot kill weapons are possible and I already though about adding one in the next version!
<br />
<br />Bats and bots using energy would be nice, but unfortunately is not possible!
<br />
<br />That's it! Enough writing now.
<br />
<br />See you all around and hopefully on the Void server!
<br />

			<div class="content">Good to hear from you. Some things possible, some things not. Ohwell the final result of this should be very interesting indeed. I will check out the Void mod online whenever time pemits (first MP too, so I can't tell you what my ID is just yet).
<br />
<br />To King Lin, this is getting way out of my league then. I point you to this site  <a href='http://www.win2000mag.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=16425' Target=_Blank>Here</a>. I honestly don't follow most of what they're talking about, but the Page fault matches, and they offer common sense soltions (labelled Possible Solution: on around the second post), so best of luck to you.
<br />
<br />Also removed the potentially ruinous information. Sorry!
<br />
<br />As a side thought, for the bomber idea you had, I had an extension of that. As the anti-fighter portion of the bomber you can use mines that come wiht the ship that are faster and better range and agility, but can only be used by them (probably massive energy usage or something like that). That was the bomber a can strictly be a bomber.

			<div class="content">The Void Server site is located <a href='http://www.voidserver.com/' Target=_Blank>Here</a>. You start on Mahatten, with a Piranha Light Fighter and  25 000 credits. You need to void mod, naturally, which is located on the main site, just scroll down (I missed it the first time, so take a good look in the middle column if you can't see it) and download it, then join the Void Server online. If you use a external connector such as FLServerConnector or fldirectip.hta (in the Freelancer/EXE directory) then the IP address is also located at hte top of the site. As for how long the games last, I'm unsure of what you mean by that, but if you mean fights? Clan fights apparently last all night, but those are with the best players, although some mass fights are trying to get organized. Hope this helps.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi!
<br />
<br />Dreyus: The idea with special mines for bombers is really good. I'll think about how to get this in, thanks!
<br />I hope I can see you on the Void server soon, but I have an exchange student at my home, who is not very interested in FL. So, I will probably not be on the server until the end of next week (he leaves on thursday).
<br />But you can use the time to level up. I'm already level 40 and have enough money to buy a Conqueror now (The mod changed the Conqueror to have a bit stronger hull than the Anubis, but still less weaponpower. As the Conqueror is also faster I think I will take it).
<br />
<br />So, see you as soon as possible.
<br />
<br />Vader: I think you already got enough information from Dreyus. The server is online 24 hours and there are many players. I already talked with some of them and they are really nice and help you, if you got problems. If you do not shoot them, they will not attack you, which is quite good in the beginning (You are just too weak with the Piranha). So, I would like to see you there. As I said above I currently do not have the time, but I will be there as soon as possible. So just level up a bit until I come. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Denstar3003: Many thanks! I like to hear that you like the mod. In the mod there are only two new systems for now (more to come in the next version) Nomad 1 and Robot 1 (for the jumphole to Robot 1 search around Planet Gammu in Unknown 1). Both Unknown systems have been changed a bit (new bases and encounters), but I think you know this already.
<br />The Anubis is stronger than the Conqueror (it has a better powerplant and a stronger hull), but therefore the Conqueror is faster and has more cargospace.
<br />So, take the ship you like. In a Conqueror you are still able to stand against several Anubis Mk2s.
<br />
<br />I hope you have fun with the mod. If you have any questions or suggestions, just post them here.
<br />
<br />Edit: One more thing. If you go to the Void server, just post your name here, so that I know you! Thanks
<br />
<br />So, see you (maybe on the Void server)!
<br />
<br />Black Eagle

			<div class="content">Black Eagle,
<br />
<br />We did some online tests with the nomad cd and torp launcher.
<br />It seems that they work on npc's but they have no effect on human players.
<br />
<br />Yesterday +/- 8 pm gmt+1 we had about 8 new players on Monkey Universe and they all loved your mod.
<br />Keep up the good work !!!
<br />
<br />Vader,
<br />
<br />Currently all new players on Monkey Universe can get a small cash boost when they want to. (not everyone wants it)
<br />
<br />If you want this new player bonus, let me know and I will edit your character with some extra millions.
<br />
<br />I assume you are an american player because i know Guardian and he is US to.
<br />Could you tell which ping the Monkey Universe shows up for you???

<br />You will find that there are a few differences between SP monkeys and the conversion to MP.
<br />
<br />If I can help you I will, The Void server has been running the monkeys MP for a few months now.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you email Black Eagle though, MP specific points will not apply to most of the players here who play Monkeys in SP.

			<div class="content">Thanks for the announcement gestoord!
<br />
<br />So, everyone can see, where to play the mod in MP. The Nomad torp/Cd problem is strange, but I will try to find a solution (In the last E-mail I asked about this, but I did not read the post. So, I now know what the problem is).
<br />
<br />Vader: Glad you like the server (You should also try the Void, but of course Monkey I&#218;niverse is great. I love both.) The new ship could have been one of the two new flyable capitalships. The Monkeys and the Robots both got a new Destroyer class ship. So, you might have see one of these.
<br />
<br />Strail: Many thanks for the offer. I think gestoord will be grateful. The second point is also good. You can post here about the Monkeys SP and announce new servers. But if you have to tell me something about MP problems or other things related to one of the MP mods based on the Monkeys, it would be better to E-mail me. But these two posts by gestoord were just okay. Something like this is still okay.
<br />
<br />That's it for now! Unfortunately I was not able to work on the next version <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> But I will do this as soon as possible!
<br />
<br />See you around! (Maybe also in MP on one of the servers <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">' THE ROBOTS '- ' PART 2 ' ,by Vader{MERCS},Based on the ' MONKEYS MOD ' by BLACK EAGLE
<br />
<br />In the last chapter, Vader ( a bounty-hunter from the colonial territories) was hot on the trail of the Powerful and very dangerous criminal , AZAR Diablo.Wanted for multiple offences against Different Capital houses within Sirius(a star constellation now occupied by man), he is the target of a major intelligence operation.Ordered primarily to gather recon intelligence,Vader has stumbled upon the Primary target using a space portal unknown to any Civillian or Military space charters, and decides to take matters into his own hands....
<br />
<br />     Staring through the reinforced Transplex of his cockpit ,Vader waits anxiously for AZAR to enter the unknown space-portal,but still manages to let out a sentence through his tense gritted teeth.
<br /> &quot;C'mon you motherf@#$@#, c'mon man....!&quot; .I can feel my heart beat like it was vibrating right through this ship.&quot;Am i doing the right thing man!?..,stuff it man!!,hes going down!!&quot;. I tell myself ,&quot; Its time to go !&quot; ,as i see AZAR's ship exhaust thrusters dissappear in a flash of lights and bright colours as he enters the space-portal.Slowly i approach the jump-hole and activate the molecular-constricter on my ship as i prepare to travel at super-sonic speed.
<br />           
<br /> Shaking violently as my ship circum-navigates the phaser-lining of the portal ,throwing me foward yet keeping me dead-centre , i mentally prepare myself for the encounter as these could very well be my last moments( i am always prepared for this eventuallity as with most Bounty-hunters,&quot; live by the sword-die by the sword &quot; ).
<br />Through the Transplex ,i can see the phaser-residue starting to thin out, indicating the end of the portal . As my ship dramatically decreases speed ,i de-activate the molecular-constricter , and lower my Blast-visor.
<br />      
<br />&quot;Where are they?......s#@#, where the hell are they?&quot;.With the parrallel jump-hole of the space portal i have just come out of ,barelly visible,i frantically flick through the spectrums of my scanners to try and pick up any signs of AZAR and his escort in the small gas-cloud surrounding the jump-hole at this end of the portal .&quot; Omicron-Beta !! &quot; I realize just where i am , when suddenly .., BOOOOMMMM  !! , SMMMAAASSSHHH !!. &quot;What the F%$% was that..!!??&quot;.
<br />
<br />               From 0 to 170 metres per second, i throw Full throttle and secondary-thrusters red-line and make a desperate shift turning me a sharp 180 degrees.&quot;What the ......??&quot;. There.. , drifting aimlessly.. , in a combination of twisted and torn alloy and fire, was what was left of the Borderworld Light-Fighter known as the ' DAGGER ' , which had not less  than a few minutes ago ,had been flown by AZAR's escort Fighter-pilot.&quot;What the Funk !, What the hell happened here !? what could have done that!!??,where the hell is AZAR !?&quot;. ( Having tangled with these ships , the ' DAGGERS ' , on countless occasions , i knew full well that these ships could be very dangerous due to their power-output and sleek ,thin fuselage design, but what could have done this ?, and what happened to AZAR ?)
<br />              
<br />Staring at the wreckage  confused, i soon notice i have an approaching object on my scanner.&quot;f@#@, Whats that !?&quot;.Not picking up an i.d. on the approaching object, i swing about ,having exited the small gas-cloud, and face myself to the open space.&quot;I better move man, whatever the hell happened to that 'DAGGER' aient happening to me man!&quot;.  Then there it was..
<br />
<br />  &quot;What the.....!??&quot;.I soon made a visual contact with the oncoming object, but what i saw , left me more confused.&quot;Oh s@#@!!....what the hell is that!!?&quot;With my heart pounding i stare at what could only be described as Terror.The object was definately a ship, but not any sort of ship i had EVER seen before in my life.Long and pointed,its body looked similar to something i had once seen in a book  about creatures that had once lived on 'Ancient-Earth'.'Scorpians' i think they were called?.Similar to the 'Scorpian', this ship had what you might describe as claws coming from mid-Fuselage/body then rounding foward towards the nose of the ship/body, but unlike the 'Scorpian',or anything else i've ever seen, this ship had a weird look to it, with a weird glow, almost as if the thing were alive!? .
<br />
<br />                 Suddenly ,i had 2 energy-bolts flying straight at me as the unknown space-vessell opens fire without warning.In a state of awe at this terrorfying yet strangely magnificant vessell, i fail to react in time as the energy-bolts crash with a deafening roar into my energy-shield.&quot; HOSTILE, ITS A HOSTILE !!&quot;. Dumbfounded, i gather my senses and start to function. &quot; S#$# , shields at 50 percent !!,what the hell did he hit me with !? &quot; . Ducking and swerving, i try my best to avoid the barrage of energy light-bolts as the unknown vessell continues to open fire , screaming through space , tearing at my ' Advanced-Sentinal graviton Energy Shield as if it were nothing !.&quot; C'mon you piece of s#$# , move !! &quot;.Red-lining  primary and secondary thrusters , my secondary-thrusters power supply is soon exhausted and they shut-down temporarily to regenerate.
<br />
<br />                 &quot;Oh s@#% , Oh s%&amp;* , C'mon!!&quot;.I check my scanners for the distance between me and the unknown vessell and break a cold sweat as i realize that this ship is maintaining an ' Attack-Speed ' , way faster than anything i have EVER seen!.I bank right and pitch vertical spinning my ship in an effort to avoid anymore energy-bolts . &quot; What the hell has this guy got man !?, shields are down to 20 percent man ! , computer &quot;, i cry , &quot;  analyze energy components &quot;.
<br />&quot;Energy components unkno...&quot;.Abruptly the vocal response from the onboard computer is interrupted as the programme is over-ridden for a more serious User-Message.&quot; Shield-Failure &quot; . &quot; Oh s@#$ man!!&quot; . Then , out of nowhere, right in front of me,  appears the last thing i needed .'AZAR!.
<br />
<br />               Cleverly hidden behind a nearby small asteroid,' AZAR Diablo 'draws from behind the floating space-rock, and lines himself up directly oncoming to my position. In a split second and with a sense of regret , i drop my head as i remember 'POWERDOLLS'  heed to &quot; wait &quot;, just moments ago when i decided to leave my recon position and follow 'AZAR' through the jump-hole.I have let my pride lead me into a trap . As i raise my head and look back up through the Transplex , i know there is no escape as right behind me flies a vessell that TOTALLY exceeds any power-rating i have ever come across, and before me , facing RIGHT at me, is ' AZAR ' .
<br />
<br /> I flick the containment switch covering my Emergency-Command board ,and prepare for ' Ejection-Capsule Launch ' , as i hear the onboard Computer warning , &quot; Incoming Missile &quot;.
<br />
<br />
