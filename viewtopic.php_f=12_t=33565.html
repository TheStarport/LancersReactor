<br />Wow, this is one of the most stuck up lawyers I've seen in years.  His answers are plain, arrogant, and to the point.  An Example :
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>GD: What is the ultimate goal here?
<br />
<br />Thompson: To destroy Rockstar.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />GD: What does that mean in terms of .....
<br />
<br />Thompson: (cutting in) So they don't exist anymore.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Now, I've been to quite a few jury duties, but most lawyers actually look at both sides of the case, to strengthen their arguments, or to see if the lawsuit is worth going after.  Another extract :
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>GD: Is there anyway to find out how Warren Leblanc acquired the game? Or is that not the point here?
<br />
<br />Thompson: <b>It doesn't matter  </b>.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I hope that Rockstar counter-sues him for this ......
<br />Feel free to discuss now .....

<br />now heres something interesting:

<br />YES IT DOES MATTER!!!! There is a certain responsibility by parents, stores and governments to restrict the flow of games into the hands of minors. to dismiss that argument as flippiantly as that is a sure sign of a mother****er.

<br />Now THAT is ****ing arrogance.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />An Entertainment Software Association (ESA) spokesperson provided us with this response:
<br />
<br />&quot;We believe that name calling is counterproductive, and, most unfortunately, serves only to trivialize these important issues. The fact is that the most objective research has concluded that there is no causal relationship between game action and real-life violence. Independent sources such as the Surgeon General of the United States, the Washington State Department of Health and the Government of Australia, have all found that there is no scientific evidence establishing a causal connection between violent games and aggressive behavior.
<br />
<br />Just two weeks ago, Judge Robert Lasnik of the U.S. District Court in Seattle, in holding Washington State's attempt to ban the sale of certain video games to minors unconstitutional, dismissed the claims of the state's expert witnesses and the studies they presented, finding that 'neither causation nor an increase in real-life aggression is proven by these studies.'&quot;
<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Now there is the proof. The governments have ruled it. if they let this lone ****ing nut have his way, then every murderer could get off of punishment by blaming the videogames market.
<br />
<br />i'll let the others speak now. ive said enough bad language for one day.

<br />
<br />However, there is a responisibility by those who make and market the game too. Would it be responsible for someone to make, manufacture and distribute a book on how to commit suicide or murder without any trace etc etc, or would you then blame the store/parents of the actions instead. You can see responsibilities by everyone <b>BUT  </b> the creators of the game here, which is kinda frightening that your so short sighted!! They are not soley responsible, but they do shoulder alot of the blame IF the murder only occured due to their game. Thats what i do not think they can prove though - that its soley due to that game.
<br />
<br />However, I do think this case is for lawyers to make money, and not to actually accomplish much...........besides - if you claim this about that game, then what about all those movies and other games that can be linked to. I do think its frugle to do this case, but its probs more to do with a lawyer trying to make a name for himself rather than righting and wrongs here.
<br />
<br />Anyhew - this looks like its going downhill fast due to three VERY aggrivated and filtered posts. We do NOT like threads that are festering and propogating hatred!
