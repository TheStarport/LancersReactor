			<div class="content">(Since it seems the war is coming to ahead, I've decided to accelerate my own little plotline. Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for...)
<br />
<br />SERVICE CORRIDOR, DECK 4, MARATHON STATION, NEW COLUMBIA SYSTEM
<br />
<br />Gairns looked up. &quot;Hey, did you guys hear that?&quot;
<br />
<br />The guards turned towards the entrance to Lab 4-Delta. Something was up.
<br />
<br />Then they heard the voice...
<br />
<br />&quot;It's complete... at last, it's complete... There is only one way to salvage this wasted sector, and that is to remove those warmongers who have torn it apart!&quot;
<br />
<br />The blast door into the lab suddenly exploded in a rage of fire. The guards turned to face the intruder now leaving - Doctor William Larings.
<br />
<br />He was barely recognizable. He had been working for months on end with little time for food or sleep. He seemed to be a withered figure... a withered figure, mind you, with glowing eyes and a silver bracer clasped onto his right wrist.
<br />
<br />&quot;Now...&quot; he grinned, &quot;Soldiers... behold the power of Promotheus!&quot;
<br />
<br />He raised his hand. The bracer around his wrist began to glow, and the lights dimmed. Energy raced across the hallway, flowing into the bracer. One of the guards fired his blaster.
<br />
<br />The bolt dissipated into Larings' hand.
<br />
<br />&quot;Die...&quot;
<br />
<br />Energy streamed back out of the bracer, sending the security officers sprawling onto the deck. Gairns felt his mind being drained out, slowly but surely, leaving him paralyzed on the deck.
<br />
<br />&quot;You fools aren't worth my time.&quot;
<br />
<br />Larings, his hand glowing with the energies drained from the guards' neurons, turned and let a golden glow surround him. Ethereal arms reached out, folding the deck into something... something huge...
<br />
<br />Gairns managed to regain some of his composure, and reached for his comlink. &quot;Command, this is Security Officer Henry Gairns...&quot; he spat, struggling against the flow of life from his slowly dying body, &quot;...Hostile on deck.&quot;
<br />
<br />CONTROL ROOM, DECK 1, MARATHON STATION, NEW COLUMBIA SYSTEM
<br />
<br />Regin heard the voice over the com. &quot;Dammit... Larings...&quot;
<br />
<br />One of the control techs turned to him. &quot;Sir? What's going on?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Larings... He's finished Promotheus... he's extended his own mind into the world around him. He can control the flow of energy.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;He's become a bloody PSYCHIC! An insane, vengeful, incredibly powerful psychic with a grudge against the entire galaxy.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh... no...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Dammit. Mobilize the Security Fleet! Don't let him get away!&quot;
<br />
<br />BRIDGE, ATS DESTINY, OUTSIDE MARATHON STATION, NEW COLUMBIA SYSTEM
<br />
<br />&quot;What the hell is that?&quot;
<br />
<br />The bridge crew turned as one to the glowing, bulging form of Deck 4. Suddenly, the deck exploded away from the station... and began flying from it at high speeds.
<br />
<br />&quot;How's it doing that?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, I'm picking up a large drop in temperature on the ship's hull... I think he's using waste heat from Marathon, Acadia, Halifax and Fairfax to power his ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, incoming transmission...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Put it through.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain, this is Samuel Regin. The object breaking away from Marathon has been declared hostile. Destroy it!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Confirmed. Rotate ship seven degrees starboard! Weapons officer, prepare to fire Hermes Cannon!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Awaiting response from Styx, sir.... Confirmation granted. Bay is cleared.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Firing solution is Starboard 327, Down 532. Lock into targeting computer and prepare cannon.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Confirmed, we targeting complete. Firing cannon!&quot;
<br />
<br />A bolt of blue light burst from around the bridge as the Hermes bolt descended on Larings' ship. The enemy vessel vanished.
<br />
<br />&quot;Kill confirmed.... huh?&quot;
<br />
<br />CONTROL ROOM, DECK 1, STYX STATION, CORTEZ SYSTEM
<br />
<br />&quot;Receiving red from ATS Destiny, bay 3.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Rerouting bay 3 towards star. Enemy has arrived, vecolity is confirmed. Kill regisetered.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Um... sir?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What is it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Something's wrong with my scanners... I'm getting some weird readings from the star...&quot;
<br />
<br />The star went nova.
<br />
<br />BRIDGE, THE KORANGAR, LOW STELLAR ORBIT, CORTEZ SYSTEM
<br />
<br />Larings grinned as he deflected the energy washing over his new ship. This was it.  The reckoning had begun.
<br />
<br />
<br />A madman, and an ultimate superweapon. Time to obliterate the universe in a raging inferno of war.</div>

			<div class="content">Message to axis:
<br />The hispanic allience has found something that requires us to stop fighting.
<br />A group of jump equipet recon fighters observed this while looking for targets for our wepons:
<br />*Shows the cortez incedent*
<br />We belive that we should end our war to deal with this. All allience ships are now no longer going to fire on you we hope that you will understand. Our missles have been disarmed and untargeted we hope that you will understand.
<br />
<br />To show our commitment to this temary truce and in honer to our fallen enimey Dsqurn we will with draw from the sigmas taus and omges we occupied. The fleets in omega 7 will stay how ever incase you diside this war must go on.
<br />
<br />Fleets in gamma:
<br />47 corsair standard fleets(ive told you them enough times but here we go again)
<br />each fleet<img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>You can use this fleet count in omega 7 as well)
<br />1 juggernaught
<br />4 battleships
<br />7 cruisers 
<br />200 titans
<br />500 centurians
<br />700 leggoneirs
<br />(New additons)
<br />5 gravty crusiers
<br />10 anti-wepon cruisers
<br />
<br />Also in gamma is the grande fleet:
<br />1 super juggernaught
<br />3 juggernaughts
<br />7 battleships
<br />15 cruisers
<br />350 titans
<br />675 centurians
<br />845 leggonairs
<br />10 gravity cruisers
<br />20 anti-wepon cruisers
<br />

<br />245 gravity crusiers
<br />490 anti-wepon cruisers
<br />10100 titans
<br />24175 centurians
<br />33745 leggonaires
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />OOC: Ok my drives can only jump from system to system or the ships will be lost in subspace is that ok now?
<br />Also these missles were designed to bring peace i WAS going to use them to bring about the surrener of the axis but i have an idea about how to stop this guy so i hope you accept my withdraw from all but the blitzcrek systems
<br />and wilde i never planed to use the wepons in omega 7 as it was mine. Ii invented these wepons as a way of having something to counter the biowepon used by rienland i have been planning these for some time.
<br />i also agree we should have someway to limit things even superwepons. Now i have seen what they cause to this RPG i will find a way that they will never be used again</div>

			<div class="content">Ya know what would be great? If ppl who are going to do long rpg posts detailing specifics of events and lives it would be great to summarize the enchilada at the bottom, saying what affect it will have on someone else.  I, and I'm sure many others, want as many people as possible to enjoy this little rpg.  For those of you who do not enjoy reading the drawn-out fan fiction, this summary will be a definite advantage.
<br />
<br />To Farmer's Alliance: We have nothing against your faction, and do not want to be forced to attack you if circumstances prove that we must do so.  Therefore I propose that we help you financially with your mining project in return for a peace treaty between our two great factions.

<br />TO KUSARI:
<br />Please occupy the Taus, to prevent LArings form entering them.
<br />TO LIBERTY REVOLUTIONARIES:
<br />If you have total control of Liberty, them we will recognize you as the new controllers of Liberty.  We invite you to chose as your formers did, and stay with the Axis of Power.  Help us stop this new threat.

			<div class="content">*Message to the revolutionary liberty commanders.*
<br />
<br />We thank you for doing what we had not the strength to do. We now offer our services to liberty with this grave new threat. The LFS Kep Salu barely escaped the blast at cortez, jumoing out 10 seconds before the shock-wave reached. I have temporarily called off the confrences with bretonia and rhineland to come personally to manhatten to discuss the signing up of our fleet and services to help keep track of this disaster and to become liberty's exploration force after the war.
<br />
<br />We only ask that you take no more action against us, as we have no more intention of fighting you. We are disarming our anti-matter minefield in New America, and standing down our raiding parties. Please allow us to help liberty with all we know, all of our technology, to overcome this gastly threat. I belive we may have a possible solution from a disaster of our own making. If you will listen to us, I will jump into new york space on the LFS Kep Salu, shields and weapons deactivated.  Please allow us to help you.
<br />
<br />*Message ends.*
<br />
<br />
<br />=LRF News flash=
<br />
<br />Today, our dream for the duration of the conflict has become a reality. Liberty has overthrown the military tyrants in charge, and the Axis/alliance war has ended.
<br />
<br />However, what caused this incident is a matter of galatic importance. *Clip of the cortez incident plays.* Not even our battleships can withstand this foe. All LRF ships have been recalled to Pan america, to try and defend against this attacker should he arrive at our humble home. In other news, better news, the junkers have arrived at pan america and all junker ships are being outfitted with our new MARCs, spectral shielding, liberator photon cannons, AM reducer coils, both the regular captial ship version for their Base-ships, and the new fighter version recently worked out for the new Dreamer class combat freighter and our fighter squadrons.
<br />
<br />In yet more news, the LFS hood was lost today when a spacial rift opened halfway through it's transit to cortez. Command is limiting all jumps to distances less than 25 lightyears, and remote gathering to a distance of less than 1/2 lightyears to try and prevent this from occuring again. Also, we are saddened to report the loss of the 5th jump squadron while escaping the last raid on rhineland war supplies. A warship opened fire on them while they began their enveloping, and the hole, collapsed.
<br />
<br />In scientfic news, scientists have thrown up their hands in defeat at the problem of moving new philidelphia to Pan america. They say that in order to get enough power to open a stabile envelope for long enough for it to make the transit to pan america would melt the planet's surface. However, with the cessation of all hostilities in light of the new threat, the final evac of new america has been canceled, and the anti-matter mine field decommisioned. A re-router has opened a new jump point in the system, and it is being prepped for a route straight to the new york system for the president's upcoming conference with liberty leaders.
<br />
<br />The 1st fleet has been completed above the hybrid cruiser level of power. The hybrid cruisers are expected to be done sometime today.
<br />
<br />=End broadcast.=
<br />
<br />=Somewhere on the border of the Pan america system.=
<br />
<br />This is collector squadron 3,we're picking up something....
<br />
<br />This is control, is there any energy anomalies?
<br />
<br />Negative, wait, thank god! It's a jumphole!
<br />
<br />Collector squadron, leave a marker beacon for recon squads to pick up. Don't go in yourself. You're looking for gas deposites in the barrier nebula.
<br />
<br />We confirm.
<br />
<br />*End comm traffic*
<br />
<br />Current numbers of ships:
<br />
<br />9 battleships
<br />5 carrier taskforce leaders
<br />9 BC's
<br />5 hybird cruisers halfway done
<br />
<br />1500 total Alliance class fighters
<br />1250 total Deerhound fighters (All assigned. Production to increase)
<br />1000 Origninal batch of new Protector class light fighters
<br />250 Freedom bombers

<br /><i> ww2jacob barely escapes Cortez!  </i>  Our great leader, ww2jacob, was on board the Empire today, when the sun in the Cortez system went supernova.  It was beleived to be the work of the Prometheus Project, a top secret project by Ageria.  It has gone terribly wrong, and it is now a threat to the entire sector.

			<div class="content">Crap. I had a really nice, long story here, and then I hit the wrong button and deleted it all. So here's the summary.
<br />
<br />1. Larings CANNOT blow up stars left and right. He has to get ridiculously close to them to instigate a supernova like at Cortez.
<br />
<br />2. Larings can suborn shipboard AIs. In the story, I demonstrated by having him take control of three Liberty loyalist battleships and the three rebel battleships they were fighting. He now has a grand total of seven ships. The crew of the other ships were spaced.
<br />
<br />3. Larings has to maintain contact with the enemy using some form of energy weapon to successfully suborn the target, and he can only use this ability on computers and AIs (a.k.a., ships that aren't using manual drive exclusively and most robots and drones).
<br />
<br />So he's not invincible, but he's damned close to it. He's also advancing towards Detroit, and its stores of robotic defense drones. Soon, no doubt, to become robotic ATTACK drones.</div>
