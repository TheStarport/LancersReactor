			<div class="content">Yep, here's yet another addition to the Freelacer fan fiction. I was bored on night and came up with this. I hope to expand and develop the story, so if you have any feedback, criticism, insults, etc. etc. etc. on the story feel free to express them.
<br />
<br />anyway, here goes.
<br />
<br />PLANET MANHATTAN, NEW YORK SYSTEM, LIBERTY SPACE
<br />
<br />One year later...
<br />
<br />	Edison Trent sat alone, slowly sipping at his Sidewinder Fang. He had 
<br />
<br />finally convinced the bartender to stock some of the fine liquor, and the 
<br />
<br />bartender had finally obliged. Trent had lived on Manhattan for the past year 
<br />
<br />after accepting Orillion's proposal to be the &quot;eyes and ears of the Order in 
<br />
<br />Liberty&quot;. Trent was not one to develop loyalty to anyone, but he felt that he 
<br />
<br />owed this to Orillion after what they had been through together. 
<br />
<br />	He had not heard from Orillion in six months.
<br />
<br />	Trent had been a busy man since that final battle with the Nomads. He had 
<br />
<br />become one of the most well-known freelancer pilots in Liberty, with a track 
<br />
<br />record unmatched by anyone else. But along with his success as a law-abiding 
<br />
<br />freelancer, he had also found success working underground for some of Sirius 
<br />
<br />Sector's most dangerous criminal agencies. Orillion had suggested that Trent, 
<br />
<br />being a freelancer, may be able to develop working relationships, or at least 
<br />
<br />contacts, with underground organizations that may have useful information for the 
<br />
<br />Order. Trent saw an opportunity to make some big money, and had made a name for 
<br />
<br />himself in criminal circles, going by the name of Carter Logan. Trent found it 
<br />
<br />amusing that many of the acquaintances he had made in the LSF spent a lot of time 
<br />
<br />hunting for Carter Logan, never realizing that many times he was flying on their 
<br />
<br />wing. 
<br />	
<br />	He had money. He had fame. He sill had the reliable Anubis that he had 
<br />
<br />been given on the Osiris. There was only one thing that Trent's fame could not 
<br />
<br />give him:
<br />
<br />	Juni.
<br />
<br />	Edison Trent and Jun'ko Zane had discovered that after the Nomad war, 
<br />
<br />their feelings toward one another went beyond mutual respect and friendship. 
<br />
<br />There had even been talk of marriage, but she had discovered Trent's double life 
<br />
<br />working for criminal organizations in Liberty and had confronted him about it. 
<br />
<br />She refused to believe his explanation that he was doing it for the Order, which 
<br />
<br />even though Orillion had given him the suggestion, he realized that it wasn't his 
<br />
<br />primary reason. He was in it for the money. Oh well, he thought at the time. 
<br />
<br />C'est la vie.
<br />
<br />	And now, six months after she had left him, the LSF and moved to Kusari, 
<br />
<br />he realized that for the second time in his life, money had cost him someone he 
<br />
<br />held dear. The first time had been the deal for a million credits' worth of Boron 
<br />
<br />that went up in smoke with Freeport 7, and now, his links with the criminal 
<br />
<br />element.
<br />
<br />	He had to admit, though, that his contacts with crime had paid dividends 
<br />
<br />that were more than mere credits. During one of his excursions outside of Liberty 
<br />
<br />he had made his way to the Omicron Alpha system, home of the Outcasts, who 
<br />
<br />because of his criminal contacts regarded him with indifference. He had learned 
<br />
<br />of a place the Outcasts used as a burial ground of sorts for their finest 
<br />
<br />warriors, believing that they would be protected by &quot;the Spirits.&quot; He had 
<br />
<br />originally decided to go to this mysterious place to do a little &quot;grave robbing&quot;, 
<br />
<br />as it were, because the Outcasts always left valuable possessions with their 
<br />
<br />deceased warriors. When he arrived, he discovered a jumphole that took him to a 
<br />
<br />previously uncharted system surrounded by Nomads who apparently didn't like his 
<br />
<br />presence there. He fled back through the jumphole and had returned to Manhattan 
<br />
<br />to transmit his findings to Orillion.
<br />
<br />	Trent downed the rest of his drink and turned to leave. He felt a slight 
<br />
<br />vibrating on his wrist from his wrist alarm, indicating he had an incoming 
<br />
<br />message on his neural net. He turned and made his way to one of several privacy 
<br />
<br />booths along the wall made specially for neural net calls.
<br />
<br />	&quot;This is Trent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, this is Orillion.&quot;
<br />
<br />        &quot;Orillion! It's been a while.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes it has. I have a new assignment for you if you're interested.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Of course.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Do you remember the information you transmitted to me six months ago?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, you've uncovered something that could change the way we deal with 
<br />
<br />the Nomad threat. I will explain everything later. Meanwhile, I want you to meet 
<br />
<br />King on Pittsburgh. You'll be escorting a...guest to the Osiris. King will brief 
<br />
<br />you further.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wait a second, Orillion. Who is this 'guest'?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I can't reveal any details right now, but King will fill you in. He's 
<br />
<br />waiting for you now. Good luck.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent switched off his neural net and walked out of the bar. It would be 
<br />
<br />good to see King again. They hadn't seen or spoken to one another since the Nomad 
<br />
<br />battle a year ago. Trent had tried to contact him several times, to no avail. 
<br />
<br />Must've been on duty somewhere secret, Trent thought to himself as he strapped 
<br />
<br />himself into his Anubis.</div>

			<div class="content">And now, folks, I am pleased to present Chapter 2 in my as-yet-untitled Fan Fiction. Enjoy!
<br />
<br />Chapter 2
<br />
<br />FORT BUSH, NEW YORK SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	Trent eased his Anubis toward the trade lane entrance that led to 
<br />
<br />Pittsburgh. He was ready to engage the trade lane when his comm system activated.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Carter Logan, this is the Liberty Security Force. You will power down 
<br />
<br />your ship and prepare to be taken into custody!&quot;
<br />
<br />	What the hell? Trent thought to himself. Had his cover been blown?
<br />
<br />	&quot;LSF patrol, this is Freelancer Alpha 1-1, Edison Trent. I am not Carter 
<br />
<br />Logan!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Freelancer Alpha 1-1, you will transmit your neural net file to us fo 
<br />
<br />verification. Hold your course or we will open fire.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent transmitted the data and waited. What was going on? Trent was ever 
<br />
<br />so careful about covering his tracks when working for criminal organizations and 
<br />
<br />had always masked his neural net transmissions.
<br />
<br />	His comm system activated again.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Freelancer Alpha 1-1,we have verified your identity. We apologize for 
<br />
<br />the inconvenience, Mr. Trent. You're clear to proceed.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent slowly let out the breath he had been holding and entered the trade 
<br />
<br />lane.
<br />
<br />
<br />PLANET PITTSBURGH, NEW YORK SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	Trent made his way to the docking ring of Planet Pittsburgh. The 
<br />
<br />encounter with the LSF still weighed heavily on his mind. Why had they suspected 
<br />
<br />him of being Carter Logan? Sure, they were right, but what had happened? Trent 
<br />
<br />had not used his alias for several months, deciding that he wanted to take life 
<br />
<br />easy for a bit and enjoy his fame.
<br />
<br />	Trent forced his attention back to reality. The mining facility where he 
<br />
<br />was to meet King was coming up. He activated the landing sequence and set the 
<br />
<br />ship down on the landing pad. Ten minutes later, he was in the bar.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good to see you again, Trent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Michael King sat at a table with a man that Trent could only assume was 
<br />
<br />the 'guest' Orillion had told him about. The man looked strangely familiar to 
<br />
<br />him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good to see you, King. How's things?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh, you know. Same old thing. Have a seat.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent sat down across from his old friend and noticed that King looked a 
<br />
<br />little worse for wear. A rather large scar ran across his forehead. Trent 
<br />
<br />wondered what King had been up to.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh, Trent, allow me to introduce you to Ernesto Chavez. He is our guest, 
<br />
<br />as it were.&quot; Trent and Chavez shook hands.
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's good to meet you, Mr. Trent. I have heard many stories of your 
<br />
<br />exploits. According to Mr. King, most of them are actually true.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; interrupted King, &quot;I heard you were actually 
<br />
<br />mistaken for Carter Logan.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent felt a twinge in his stomach. He actually felt guilty lying to 
<br />
<br />King, but he couldn't let his guard down now.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah, I thought it was a little weird myself.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;From what I hear, he's got a pretty good bounty on him. He's raised 
<br />
<br />quite a bit of hell around here. I'd like to take him down, I could use the 
<br />
<br />credits.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent wasn't sure he liked where this conversation was going, so he 
<br />
<br />decided to change the subject.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion said you would tell me what's going on.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right,&quot; King replied, &quot;business it is. We'll be escorting Mr. Chavez 
<br />
<br />to the Osiris. She's currently in Sigma-13, doing a little surveillance. Mr. 
<br />
<br />Chavez has some information he has agreed to share with the Order.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I see. It must be pretty important information to warrant an escort and 
<br />
<br />a direct meeting with Orillion.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It is,&quot; replied King. &quot;It is information that is as significant as the 
<br />
<br />discovery you made. Am I correct, Mr. Chavez?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;That is correct. You see, Mr. Trent, I am an Outcast. And I know why the 
<br />
<br />Nomads leave us alone. Shall we be off, then? Orillion is awaiting us.&quot;
<br />

			<div class="content">And now...Chapter 3.
<br />
<br />Chapter 3
<br />
<br />HONSHU SYSTEM, KUSARI SPACE
<br />
<br />	Trent flew the lead, as he had in countless missions before. King followed closely behind, flying a brand-new Liberty Defender Mark II. Chavez flew between them in a Border Worlds Stiletto. Trent had often thought about purchasing a new ship, but he had been so successful with the Anubis he thought if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
<br />
<br />	The trip so far had been relatively uneventful. Usually on a trip of this length, it ws safe to expect a pirate attack at some point. They had kept a low profile, speaking very little to one another except when needed. It was King who broke the silence.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So tell me, Trent, Where did you get your information about the Nomads from? Orillion said it's going to make a big difference.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent was silent for a moment, choosing his words carefully. &quot;I'm sill a frelancer, King. I hear rumors. This one just turned out to be a good one.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, I guess everyone gets lucky now and then. Hold on...Trent, I'm picking up unknown contacts. Looks like they're on an intercept course. Heads up.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent watched his scanner as the number of contacts increased. Finally his computer identified them.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Outcast Sabres! I count at least ten!&quot; Trent called out.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Damn! Trent, keep these guys away from Chavez! My gut says they're after him!&quot;
<br />
<br />	Ten Outcast Sabre fighters emerged from the dust cloud spraying cannon fire at the three ships. The three broke formation and prepared to engage.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Chavez, this is King! Get to the jump gate! We'll try to hold them off!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Negative, I will stay and fight!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Dammit, Chavez, this is no time for pride! Get the hell out of here!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;King, you listen to me. I'm not going anywhere! Deal with it!&quot; And with that, Chavez destroyed one of the Outcast fighters.
<br />
<br />	Trent had his hands full with another Sabre that he couldn't shake off his tail. Whoever he was, he was good. Trent's shields were taking a beating, and his shield battery supply was getting low. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;King, get this guy off of me!&quot; Trent called out as he dropped several mines. Two of them, luckily, scored a hit, severely damaging the fighter. King came out of nowhere and finished him off with a well-placed gun volley.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, Chavez, we've got to make a run for it! Let's go!&quot; King punched his cruise engines and made a beeline for the jump gate. Trent noticed smoke and gas pouring out of King's badly damaged ship
<br />
<br />	Trent's scanner beeped again, and an icy ball materialized in Trent's stomach
<br />
<br />	&quot;Holy God! I got more contacts coming in!&quot; Trent punched his cruise engines. Chavez did the same.
<br />
<br />	The Outcasts turned to follow and launched a volley of cruise disruptors at the fleeing ships. One found its mark.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent! Chavez is hit! Cover him!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, King. Take Mr. Chavez and head for the gate. We'll cover you,&quot; a familiar voice said over the comm channel.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Von Claussen??? Is that you??&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ja, it is. Get Chavez out. We will hold them off. Go!&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent looked out his cockpit window as a squadron of Anubis fighters appeared and began to engage the Outcasts.
<br />
<br />	 &quot;My cruise engines are back online,&quot; Chavez said. &quot;I suggest we do as he says.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Fine with me,&quot; King replied. &quot;Let's go. Thanks, Von Claussen.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You may thank me later. Now go!&quot;
<br />
<br />	The three ships engaged their cruise engines and headed for the jump gate. 
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Chapter 4
<br />
<br />BATTLESHIP OSIRIS, SIGMA-13 SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	Trent, King and Chavez approached the Osiris.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Osiris, this is Escort Group Alpha, requesting clearance to dock. Over.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Escort Group Alpha, you are cleared to dock. Welcome back.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, go ahead and dock. I'll meet you and Chavez in the hangar.&quot;
<br />
<br />	------
<br />
<br />	&quot;Welcome back, King. Ah, Trent. Good to see you again.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good to be back, Orillion.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And this must me Mr. Chavez. I'm Casper Orillion.&quot; The two shook hands. &quot;Come to my office. We have a lot to talk about. I'll see you gentlemen later.&quot; Orillion and Chavez walked away.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Come on, Trent. I could use a drink. My treat.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent and King went to the bar and sat down with their drinks.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You know,&quot; King said, &quot;Chavez must know something pretty damn important for his own kind to want to take him down. Obviously something they didn't want us to know about.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah.&quot; Trent replied. He was still wondering why Chavez looked so familiar to him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ah, gentlemen. Do you mind if I join you?&quot; Herr von Claussen asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied Trent. &quot;But aren't you dead?&quot;
<br />
<br />	von Claussen laughed. &quot;No, but it it sometimes advantageous to let everyone think you are. After all, we all have our secrets, don't we?&quot; von Claussen gave Trent a knowing look that didn't make him feel all that comfortable.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You are full of surprises, von Claussen, &quot; King said. &quot;Listen, I gotta make a pit stop. Don't steal my drink while I'm away.&quot; King rose and left.
<br />
<br />	Trent waited until King was out of earshot and asked, &quot;So you know?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, Mr. Trent. Or should I say, Mr. Logan?&quot; Trent had to smile at that. &quot;Orillion hyas many ways of acquiring necessary information. As my name is still considered poison in Rheinland, being a dead man has its advantages. And who wouldn't want the best pilot in Liberty working for them? Even criminals, I would wager.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, they pay pretty good.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, that they do. And the rumors, I hear, are also quite informative. Orillion seems to put a high premium on the information you provided to him.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;so I'm told.&quot;
<br />
<br />	King returned to the table. &quot;You still talking smack about me?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Someone has to do it. Your head's big enough already.&quot; Trent retorted.
<br />
<br />	The Osiris bartender walked up to the group.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion would like to see you in his office.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Right.&quot;
<br />
<br />	-------
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ah, Gentlemen, sit down,&quot; Orillion said. &quot;I have some very interesting information to give you.&quot; Trent noticed that many of Orillion's top agents were also in the room.
<br />
<br />	&quot;As many of you now know, we have received information regarding the Nomads and the Outcasts. Thanks to the information provided by our newest member, Ernesto Chavez, we now have a new perspective on the Nomads, and possibly a new strategy to fight them.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Several months ago, Edison Trent received information regarding a jump hole in the Omicron Alpha system that reportedly leads to an uncharted system populated with Nomads. Apparently the Outcasts use the area around the jump hole as a burial ground of sorts for their greatest pilots, believing that &quot;the Sprits&quot; will protect their remains.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Now, one would think that with a jump hole leading right into the Sirius Sector, the Nomads would be attacking en masse through the hole. But they don't. And now, thanks to Mr. Chavez, we now know why. People, we now have a new weapon in which to fight the Nomads.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And what would that be?&quot; asked King.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Cardamine.&quot;

			<div class="content">Keep this up, we're hooked, an author can't let his hooked readers down, it's against protocol, and besides we wouldn't let you waste such a creative and literary mind waste away, now could we??  You can't just freelancer when you can also write about it with such masterly skill and ease.   Don't give up to the barricade of writers' block, but rather remember that overcomming challenges are fun, like your first won battle in freelancer.  Now, if you hadn't had justices &amp; a starflier, rather a Stilletto with nomad weapons and a level 10 shield, would it have been as fun blasting those rogues into cream of space?? Definitly not.  The thrill of fighting for survival has its own thrills, just as we seek thrills and enjoyment from reading the exploits of Trent in your fan fiction, and seeing what new and exciting twist your crafty mind puts on the already astounding plot.  Don't keep us in suspense, remember, after playing freelancer for so long, you have an 'Inner Trent', so draw upon him as an aide for this novel.
<br />Remember, your loyal readers are here for you, so...
<br />
<br />Don't let us down, we're counting on you!
