			<div class="content">Now i finally know what to think about this community after my posts have been deleted for no reason. I have not violated a single rule. So its true about what people say about the abusive behaviour of the forum moderators here.
<br />
<br />Not enough of this it seems to be normal to say that people didn't contribute anything to a discussion but take up what has been said by those people in order to present it as own new idea.
<br />
<br />I bow to this community and its moderators for treating members this way and driving them away while other members seem to be allowed to do everything and break rules non-stop.
<br />
<br />If you delete this post like you did delete all my other posts it just shows all other visitors how you deal how you deal with critics and how you abuse your powers.</div>

<br />
<br />It's possible that Finalday may have moved a post if it was in the wrong forum but when he does that he always tells the person that in so many days he will be moving it and where to.
<br />
<br />Most likely your post is still where it was but your not seeing it for some reason or other.
<br />
<br />Take a good look and see if it isn't still where you put it and if it isn't post it again and tell me where you put it and what the topic is so I can check it out for myself...</div>

			<div class="content">Nope, I deleted his posts. He registered here to flame, not help, contribute or take part. His sole posting was to divert a topic, remove it's actual useful and informative nature - and drag it into a childrens playgrounds of insults and rubbish.
<br />
<br />I don't have time for it, i made a post why I deleted your posts... and you continued to start ranting on again, even harder than before. I deleted that post too.
<br />
<br />As I said, i won't let the thread get hijacked with that rubbish - it's a great thread with people trying to solve issues. You're sole reason to enter the fray was to cause trouble.
<br />
<br />Not happening.
<br />
<br />Post anywhere else you like, not that thread though. Oh, and yes, insulting folks and flaming away is against the rules.

<br />
<br />Nope, no-one else was breaking rules. Only thee, who seemed incapable of actually being civil, understanding what he was talking about OR providing evidence. The last part reminds me of the person you were trying to &quot;defend&quot;, when they also only entered the thread to stir things up. 
<br />
<br />As for abusing power - that must be what everyone else considers exercising it?
<br />Abuse would to be randomly and without good reason, delete others posts. I had good reason, and you weren't attacking me - you were attacking other forum members without any need. He'd been civil to you, you were bloody uncivil to him. I ended it... repeatedly.

<br />In my opinion, Yes if you have really tried to look for your answer by using forum search.
<br />
<br />I find if your question is a very simple one that is already answered somewhere more than once then people won't reply. Personally I make a note to that person pointing him/her to where his question has already been answered, and I would like to see more people doing that instead of no replies at all.</div>

<br />
<br />That are the &quot;Posting Rules&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We don't have many rules on the Forums, but we do have some - which we request you observe during your posting please!
<br />
<br />    * Do not discuss the following, as they are forbidden: Politics, Religion, Cloaks.
<br />    * Please don't use capital letters in the subject lines for new threads.
<br />    * Don't use smilies or emoticons in the subject lines of new threads.
<br />    * Please do not post multiple full size images in threads - see here for what to do.
<br />    * Refrain from using any language that is a slur or swear word - your posts will be edited or deleted.
<br />    * Please try the Search function if you are looking for information on the Forums.
<br />    * Consider which Forum your topic is best suited for before posting - no point putting a modding topic in Freelancer Discussion for example.
<br />    * Do not flame, abuse, or post anything that is insulting towards other members, but instead treat one another with respect.
<br />    * Refrain from posting in old threads unless your comment is on topic, and contributory. Comments of 'Thanks' or 'Ace' are not considered contributory.
<br />    * Lancers Reactor is not a neutral ground to flame or bash clans or servers, so do not attempt this.
<br />    * If there is an issue with a Moderator's decision - please email the Moderators, or the site owners Eraser and/or bakedpotato. Please DO NOT argue on the Forums about this!&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />from what ive read CB didnt break a rule... the only thing he did was to defend someone else and voicing his oppinion about the behaviour of other members which actually broke one of the rules above by continious verbal attacks against other members of this community
<br />as response CB got attacked personally because of his language
<br />CB also posted his observations as modder to this topic but that got deleted
<br />the only thing you can judge him about is the fact that he called the posted assumptions &quot;wrong&quot; and the behaviour of some members towards other members &quot;stupid&quot;
<br />as far i can remember there was no swearing... no insults... no other broken rule... nothing that CB is guilty of
<br />
<br />you might have had your reason to delete the posts but to claim that his (not existing) rule violations are the reason is just a pathetic excuse
<br />since the posts were about the original topic it would have been better to edit function to solve this problem or give out an warning to the those which violated the rules
<br />but this did not happen
<br />
<br />oh and one final comment: 
<br />also moderators should follow rules and be able to prove a rule violation instead of just doing the claim

			<div class="content">It is hard to say either way without proof. What you have said is based on second-hand information, which may or may not be accurate. So unless someone posts a copy of what was actually said then there is little room for debate here. The rules of this site must be enforced. Moderators and admins have discretionary powers to enforce rules they believe have been violated.
<br />
<br />If the rules are unclear then they need to be rewritten so that they are clear. If a moderator or admin has really done something wrong then make sure you have evidence to prove it--in the case of deleted or edited posts then I would suggest you make a copy of any future posts you think might be deleted/edited and present that as evidence. By copying I mean saving the entire page as a single document; for example, Internet Explorer allows you to save a complete page as an .mht file. And make sure that when you bring the subject up to another admin that you make a clear, calm, and well-supported argument. Anyone flaming people will simply be ignored.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p430114" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">From my observations on the topic in dispute..&quot;Making path.ini files&quot; :
<br />
<br />I believe OP-R8R is perfectly capable of defending himself. 
<br />However, for other parties to jump in on OP-R8R's behalf in his defense 
<br />was a commendable act but it was really unnecessary to add subject matter 
<br />not related to the primary topic in discussion. Even less appropriate for 
<br />anyone to &quot;flame&quot; anyone. That 's just plain unprofessional conduct. Stuff
<br />like that tends to happen when we're under pressure from other sources.
<br />
<br />A lot of people are very adept modders, programmers and such...
<br />At times we tend to become a little defensive or irrate if we have 
<br />misunderstandings. The fact of life is that all of us don't see eye to eye.
<br />This is one reason why there are so many different mods and modding techniques.
<br />
<br />Making path files is a very tedious and sometimes frustrating task, 
<br />especially when it's being done by hand. I know this myself since I'm 
<br />in the middle of doing it now. 
<br />Unfortunately, the FLEx path generator isn't creating the paths I need
<br />created using specific protocols. 
<br />In my case, I have to make certain the paths I've selected are the appropriate
<br />legality. When the FLEx did this for me, I ended up with a terrible mess and 
<br />CTD's because of it. So this is why I am hand creating the path files. It really 
<br />isn't hard to do, but it's just tedious. I can't even rely on the original stock path 
<br />files from the vanilla version for this, but I am following the protocols 
<br />those path files employed to create my own accurately.
<br />
<br />Chips has been very patient and very instrumental in working on this particular 
<br />path problem. He has given me some new insight that I've not had before this.
<br />The path files he generated for me were outstanding works, but unfortunately 
<br />I'm not able to employ them since there have been new changes to my path files.
<br />
<br />OP-R8R made his statement regarding &quot;hand editing&quot; and for that matter..
<br />to me it makes a lot of sense. At least what I am doing now is a quite a lot 
<br />more accurate than the automated results I was getting. 
<br />I'm not saying that what the generator was doing is wrong..
<br />it just did what it was supposed to do based on certain protocols. 
<br />However, my protocols are a little different for my needs and this 
<br />is what requires me to hand create my particular path files.
<br />I wish there were an easier way, but considering how I messed it up 
<br />to begin with when I originally changed and created new paths..
<br />the path generator seems to have compounded my dilemma. 
<br />I have to make a conscious decision on certain paths regarding their 
<br />&quot;legality&quot; to prevent having a tangled up mess again. At present, I don't think 
<br />the path generator can do this.
<br />I'm not about to dump two years of work on a mod because my path files 
<br />are screwed up. I'm going to fix it.
<br />If not for the helpful feedback I've been getting from everyone involved,
<br />I'd be hopelessly lost.</div>

			<div class="content">He was never a part of the community to start with, he's part of your community.
<br />
<br />He came here, not to participate, but flame... rather lose him than Breslin, who's actually useful and participates constructively.
<br />
<br />So no loss in my little opinion <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />As for driving other members away - well, according to you if we let people say what they want - we have people driven away. If we put a stop to that, then we drive people away. 
<br />I assume that you mean I am the one driving people, i'm not a bad driver it has to be said, least they're safe.
<br />
<br />So there's a catch 22 again.
<br />
<br />I am more than happy not to be a moderator though - so get onto the admins if you wish me removed, it really makes no odds to myself - I just don't care <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I assume you think this will also stop members being lost too, so that'd be a good thing <img src=smilies/icon_smile_approve.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Seeing as you care so much, get some support and take it to BP or Louva or Eraser, they'll make the appropriate changes to my status <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
