			<div class="content">The news brief below is about yet another expectant wife killing by
<br />a husband that's hit our headlines lately.  This one follows in the
<br />footsteps of the Laci Pederson murder which hit the news late last
<br />year.
<br />
<br />This seems to be the new murder flavor of the day over here.  Husbands
<br />killing wives who are expecting their first child.
<br />
<br />Reason for my post.....  I am unable to comprehend what these guys were
<br />thinking and incredulous at the fact that they might even have thought that
<br />they could get away with it.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />To flesh out the story a little, when the fact that the women had gone
<br />missing first hit the news, it was explained that until that point in
<br />time, the parents of the husband as well as the wife's parents had all
<br />been convinced and believed that the husband was all set to start Medical School at the University of North Carolina.  The UNC Medical School is a fairly well regarded one and certainly is not easy to gain admission.
<br />
<br />Once it was reported that the wife had gone missing, the University was contacted as the husband had gone missing (later learned that he'd voluntarily checked himself into a psychiatric clinic).  The University
<br />denied having any record of an application from, much less a decision to admit the husband into their program.</div>

			<div class="content">From the NY Times Aug 3, 2004
<br />
<br />
<br />The husband of a missing Salt Lake City woman was arrested today and charged with suspicion of murder, the Salt Lake City police said.
<br />
<br />Mark Hacking, the husband of Lori Kay Hacking, was arrested and charged with one count of suspicion of aggravated murder as he was released from a psychiatric hospital where he had been since the day after he reported his wife missing two weeks ago. He was transferred today to a jail, where he is under suicide watch, Police Chief Rick Dinse said.
<br />
<br />&quot;We believed very early in the investigation that she was a victim of a crime and that her husband may very well have been involved,&quot; Chief Dinse said at a televised news conference.
<br />
<br />Mr. Hacking told the police on July 19, a Monday, that his wife had not shown up for work. Her car was later found near a jogging trail, but her body has still not been found.
<br />
<br />At the first word of her disappearance, hundreds of volunteers spent days searching for any sign of Ms. Hacking, who is said to have been pregnant at the time she disappeared. But this weekend, Ms. Hacking's family called off the search, saying they had new information from Mr. Hacking.
<br />
<br />The chief would not give many details of Ms. Hacking's fate, or how it was led to the charges against Mr. Hacking, but did say that they believed that she was murdered inside the couple's apartment.
<br />
<br />&quot;We know where the homicide happened and we believe it happened in the apartment,&quot; he said. &quot;We did recover evidence from the car.&quot;
<br />
<br />Last week, the police began focusing their search on a nearby two-acre dump and indicated that they were looking at Mr. Hacking as a &quot;person of interest,&quot; although at the time they did not call him a suspect.
<br />
<br />The day after he reported his wife missing, Mr. Hacking, 28, was seen running around at night wearing only sandals outside a motel where he had taken a room. He checked himself into a psychiatric hospital.
<br />
<br />Investigators focused on Mr. Hacking after learning that he had been at a store buying a new mattress just before reporting his wife missing. Investigators have refused to discuss news reports that they found a mattress in a nearby trash bin.
<br />
<br />They also said they had learned that Mr. Hacking lied about graduating from college and being accepted to a medical school in North Carolina. The couple had been preparing to move to North Carolina.
<br />
<br />Mr. Dinse said investigators would continue to sift through the 3,000 tons of garbage at the landfill because of the possibility that Ms. Hacking's body might be there. Such a prospect &quot;is not something that makes all of comfortable,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not a pleasant thought. The thought that she might have to stay there is something else we don't want to think about.&quot;
<br />
<br />He said investigators were determined to find her body if it was buried in the landfill.
<br />
<br />&quot;They've been out there many, many nights,&quot; the chief said. &quot;There's not one complaint from anybody. They're all committed to finding Lori.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Not only did he kill his wife but he also killed his unborn child. Anyone that can bring themselves to that is someone that does not deserve to live. I say let him fry along with scott peterson.
<br />
<br />Who else thinks he should get charged with two counts of murder and not just the one? One for his wife and one for his unborn child.

			<div class="content">I live in Utah.  My thing is, why the hell do people think they can do this and get away with it?  They never do.  My feeling is if this guy gets convicted of murder(more than likely, given the evidence) they should kill the son of a *****.  It IS a capital crime here in Utah.  They don't even need a body.  If they do find the body and that Lori WAS pregnant, that makes Mark Hacking a multiple murderer, and his ass WILL fry.

			<div class="content">@Indy:  The latest is that police say that Mark talked to a &quot;reliable witness&quot; at the psychiatric ward, and said that he killed his wife while she was sleeping then dumped her body into a trash bin.  So, basically the night she disappeared, she was killed.  Nobody knows why.  It's a terrible thing.  I don't what it is about these missing people cases that grabs me, but it pisses me off to no end that people can kidnap and/or kill people then dump their body and expect to get away with it.  You DON'T get away with something like that.  EVER.  If Lori was pregnant, as I said before, Mark will be a multiple murderer and if convicted, will spend the rest of his life in prison, without parole, or will be executed.  Personally, I hope he fries.
