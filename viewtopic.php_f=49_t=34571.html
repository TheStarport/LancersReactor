			<div class="content">not q what you may think it's going to be, this thread.
<br />
<br />recently I was fortunate enuff to read an excellent book, the best I've read in a long while now, called &quot;True Tales of American Life&quot; by Paul Auster. It isn't a novel, it's a collection of short stories and anecdotes collected from material submitted to the National Radio Project in recent years. Ordinary people write in with incidents from their lives that are memorable; joyous, tragic, terrifying, bizarre, profound, or downright unbelievable, the point being it had to be something that had made such an impression that it had never been forgotten by the person relating the story. Things like the mother who sold her wedding ring during the Depression to buy new trousers for her son so that he could go to his band parade, or the woman who found her mother's missing antique china on the very last stall at a flea market she went to on impulse, or the story of how a Ku Klux Klan member's beloved dog rushed out into the street during the annual KKK parade and unmasked his owner as the whole town looked on. Some are mysterious, like the story of a woman who watched a white chicken walk purposefully down a street in Portland, Oregon, hop up some porch steps, knock on the door, and calmly enter the house.&quot; Stuff like that. (in America the book is called &quot;I Thought My Father Was God..&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So I was wondering? what stories do we have her on TLR that would fit the same criteria. Here's one that comes to mind for me..
<br />
<br />- When I was a kid my folks rented our television, people did back then. when it went wrong an engineer would come out to fix it. one time an engineer came out and my folks had gone out, leaving me on my own. the engineer, a grubby old man, fixed the telly quickly and said that it ahd been a nice easy job, just an adjustment. When my dad came back i told him what the engineer had said but not verbatim, I actually said &quot;it was so easy I could have done it myself&quot; which my dad then thought was what the engineer had said. He phoned the rental company and complained. a few years later, i saw a picture of the engineer in the local rag, vandals had burnt down his home, which was a grotty leaky caravan in a field where he'd been forced to live since.. losing his job as a tv repairman some years previously.
<br />
<br />I'd never thought about it until that moment. I'd got this bloke sacked, in all probability, with my big stoopid mouth, and by consequence reduced him to living in this miserable squalid state. I felt, and still feel, terribly guilty about that.
<br />

			<div class="content">When I was 6 or 7, we lived in a town in California right next to the Mexican border.  There was a public golf course that my Dad frequented on weekends.
<br />One side of it ran along the border.  A really tall fence with coiled barbed wire strung along the top of it stretched out as far as you could see along the border.
<br />
<br />I don't know which hole but one of the holes played with a fairly straight fairway that ran right along that fence.
<br />
<br />I remember going with my Dad once and seeing all these cardboard shanties set up across from a dirt track that bounded the fence on the Mexican side.  Kids my age and older were lined up on the fence with their hands stuck through the fencing trying to hawk golf balls that they'd found on their side.
<br />
<br />I remember asking my Dad why these kids lived in boxes and looked so dirty.  My Dad must have forgotten about this hole because he was visibly upset with what I was able to witness.  He just plunked me in the golf cart and drove us off without finishing his round.

			<div class="content">When I was just a wee lad of 9 or 10, we were staying up at our holiday joint out in the boonies of the Australian coastline. Anyway one evening my brother, cousins and myself were out walking the country streets and came across a field of corn that was being grown by one of the local farmers. Well considering the penchant we all have for fresh corn we decided to help ourselves to a few cobs and consume them on the km journey home. Pharking delicious I tell you, best corn I&#8217;ve ever had. We stashed the remaining corn under the house and went to bed with full stomachs and drifted off to sleep.
<br />
<br />The next morning we awoke to loud raps upon the door. My dad woke up and answered the door to an angry farmer demanding some answers as to why his corn had been stolen. We were front and centred and asked if we had stolen this farmers corn, of course we all fervently denied these preposterous allegations! That is until the farmer pointed out that he had discovered our indiscretion by simply following the trail of corn leaves that had originated from the point of theft to our front gate.
<br />
<br />Certainly wasn't our most well concieved plan.</div>

			<div class="content">I've posted half of this before so i'll post most of it. Some is too graphic for our younger generation here.
<br />
<br />This started 2 years ago. Me and my female best friend were really close. We could confide in each other regardless of what it was without fear of judgement or anything like it. Her boyfriend, a really good friend of mine who i have  known for 8 years, the kindest mate you could have. Anyway, i spent most of my free time with either my best friend or both together and we used to have a really good laugh (nothing sordid).
<br />But when i was spending time alone with my friend, because i had a lot of so called friends that stabbed me in the back, finding someone i could confide in was fantastic as i am a person who usually bottles up alot of my emotion. Because of this, I got too close. Her relationship with her bf was on the rocks but was never going to end but i decided i would make a move. BIG mistake. Not only did i almost lose at the time two of my closest friends, but i drove myself down the nasty long path called depression. I was put on tranquilisers to calm me down (and i am a very placid person now) sleeping pills and anti depressents. A saw Counsellors and Psychiatrists (sp) nothing would actually help. A lot more than the depression happened as well. Anyway, in the end i got very bad and by pure chance i happened to get in contact with an ex gf of mine from when i was 11. We hadn't seen each in 10 years and we kicked off our relationship, albeit an adult one, straight away. She was in a similar situation to me so we helped each other. Within weeks, we were off all the medication, i still saw a counsellor for my parents benefit. That last part was just over a year ago. My personality has returned and for almost every minute  of the day i am happy. I am doing very well at my job and enjoy life greatly. No more feeling sorry for myself!!</div>

			<div class="content">when I was about 6/7 my dad wanted to take us to see a relative in Wigan, Lancashire. I'd never been to Wigan and asked him what it was like. He laughed and pointed and said &quot;if you go to Wigan you'll end up like that..&quot; it was a skeleton depicted on an antismoking poster at the side of the road, at the top of a steep hill. I was terrified. 
<br />
<br />a short while later my mother said she felt ill so we turned back. we never got to Wigan. I hid from the poster on the way back.
<br />
<br />Every time we went down that road, even after the poster got changed, I was scared. for years I'd suggest alternative routes so we didnt have to go past that spot, and later as an I adult I rarely went to to my parents home town and if I did, I'd go other ways. 
<br />
<br />And I was 34 before I went to Wigan! I'd always managed to avoid it, or go round it, or find reasons not to go. But this time I had to, it was work and it was important. besides I wasnt going to go on letting myself be dominated by this childish fear.
<br />
<br />I was very nervous. I looked at all the people I passed to see if they exhibited any skeletal characteristics, because for years I'd ecome convinced that there must be something in the Wigan environment that slowly emaciates and kills you. Gromit's pot, propbably<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> But of course it's a grimy Northern town like many others, nothing special. I was still slightly relieved to get away and paranoically went for health checks after. And I've never been back (though not fopr any other reason than there is no reason to go)
<br />
<br />&lt;sigh&gt; we never truly rid ourselves of our childhoods, do we? they shape us for good or ill for the rest of our days.</div>

			<div class="content">The only Big thing was in the 11th grade. In shop class, another kid had been giving me a hard time and wouldn't back off. At one point it went to pushing. After the teacher yelled at us, I went back to working on the lathe. Withing 5 minuets, the kid had picked up a 2x4 and hit me over the head with it. I finally lost it. One shot to the stomach and he bent over, I put my arms around him and picked him uop, up side down. My intention was th throw him away from me, but what happened, was he went head first straihght down to the concret floor. A real pile driver. I thought the teacher was going to get me expelled for standing up for myself.Another student explained what happened, and we both got suspended for a day and he had a goose egg the size of and tennis ball on his head. I only weighed 145lbs back then. A skinny little kid. But, he and others left me alone after that. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
