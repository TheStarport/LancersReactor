			<div class="content">Hmm,
<br />
<br />Interseting thoughts. My take is neither is better, and servers that are primarily one or the other are worse than servers that just let you play FL.
<br />
<br />On PVP servers you get the frag fest and new or underskilled players get fragged off. (Lost my sons interest thanks to a **** who fragged him whilst I was trying to get him back to safety in his first; and last, ever MP game.. I pmed the ****, who was dock camping just outa NY on the 24/7 universe server, told him who my boy was and that he had NEVER played MP before and could he please let him pass. I offered to come out and let him shoot at me in my under powered ship repeadedly if he liked in exchange. My boy exits the TL by the JG BOOM!! blasted to bits. Asked him to play on another place with me &quot;Nah dad I dont want to its no fun&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />On RP servers you are almost required (Some you actually are) to join a clan, then you HAVE TO have ALL your characters the same with that clan.. This is role play how?? Why is it I can not play the Role of a Pirate character AND have another character that is opposite?? I thought we were Role playing not really living it?? (For the record Im 38 years old and have played a multitude of paper and dice RPG's over the years. Strangely enough back then we could play what we wanted and what our other characters were had no bearing so long as we could pull of the role we wanted to play this time!)
<br />
<br />Sooo, my answer was to start my own server and forbid both types of behaviors <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Adui,  The issues you have with servers not allowing a person to play both sides is not totally true. If a player can show he or she can RP well, they will be allowed to do both. The problem is with a lot of players who cannot seperate one side from the other when and if they are allowed the chance to play different characters. These people will use info they gather as one character to assist there other chadacter even though that character is not involved in that particular RP. It takes a special kind of person to be able to do this or a true RP type person to play 2 sides.
<br />
<br />As far as your son's experience, I am sorry abbout that and I would hope the admins of that server would try to stop that type of behavior. A lot of servers will have rules in place that players under a certian level cannot be attacked.

			<div class="content">Well fadius, Im glad to hear some places allow roleplayers to play both sides, and I can see the need to limit it to those who can prove they can separate things.
<br />
<br />As for the incident with my son, that was a year ago, I have been told numerous times since that on that particular server that kind of behavior is status quo.
<br />
<br />I did however get even sort of... I stooped to that persons level in a way I guess, I went back to the IONCOSS server and told my friends what happened. About 5 of the best PVP players there wanted the name of the player and server, my understanding is they fragged him repeatedly for several weeks after *EG*
<br />
<br />The brighter side of things, my son is playing SP freelancer again, and I think I will be able to get him on my server in MP.

			<div class="content">Very few things strike me as unsportsman like than camping out near a docking ring or a station and blowing the bejesus out of anybody coming out or trying to go in. IMHO, this activity is neither RP or PVP, it's simple harassment.
<br />I actually have a solution for that....
<br />NOMADS and lots of them!!
<br />What I've done in my mod is enable nomads throughout most systems. This also means you'll likely encounter them as soon as you launch off of Manhattan. BUT...this also prevents anyone from camping nearby because the nomads will take it upon themselves to &quot;light 'em up&quot;  .  Now, anyone launching from Manhattan or most other planets or bases will most likely encounter them, but at least they have a better chance of escaping than they would with some uscrupelous camper.
<br />
<br />These may be only lvl 10 nomads, BUT..their laser refire rates will certainly kill anyone (including anyone in capital ships) who just sit there. With a refire rate of 4 per laser at a damage of over 1000 per shot, then you have a group of 12 show up . Even my best capital ships have taken a severe beating by them.
<br />
<br />Then there are the upper lvl nomads...these fellas have cruise disruptors and they are in the &quot;Punitive&quot; system as well as the &quot;outworld&quot; systems. Very tough hombres. 
<br />The &quot;Punitive&quot; system I created is called &quot;Antartica&quot; and just like the Original Alaska is a dead end system. One way in, One way out. But....
<br />To send a player to this system is &quot;punishment&quot; where they are stripped of their pride and joy ship and given a choice of basic ships. Then they must travel throughout this system to &quot;earn&quot; a given level of credits for a &quot;Pardon&quot; out of the system. Meanwhile, since they are &quot;stuck&quot; in this system, the upper lvl nomads and bounty hunters will be after them making their stay in Antartica not such a pleasant experience.
<br />Then there is the various base characters who have something to say to the offender when they go check on the rumors. (Some of it quite humorous I might add)
<br />
<br />So, enabling nomads throughout most systems (including new systems) will basically take care of the unsportsman problem for itself.
