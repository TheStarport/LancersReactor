			<div class="content">I just got a Sabre, and I think pretty highly of it... however, I've heard that the Titan is more powerful, yet apparently doesn't fly as well. How does the Titan's handling compare to a Sabre? Or, for that matter, a Humpback?
<br />
<br />Just after I finished the storyline, there I was with my Anubis and about a million in cash, and suddenly I'm level 32. I figgered it was time to git me a better ship... so, after a LOT of running around and a LOT of cash spent on bribery, I finally managed to get in good with the Red Hessians, intending to git me a Sabre... only, by the time I was done bribing (I brived numerous factions), I no longer had enough dough to buy the ship! Being on New Berlin, I decided to trade in my trusty Anubis for a Humpback... one or two trade runs and I'd have enough cash for my new ship. What I failed to realize was that the noble Humpback manouvers with the grace and agility of a myopic geriatric pachyderm. Being stuck in omega 11 (I think), out of cash, docked on a station, and in need of repair, I almost had to restart the frickin' game - every time I left the station I was immediately attacked by at LEAST 4 Corsairs... I died about a dozen times before I managed to escape. Long story short, I've finally got my Sabre, and I like it. It's a remarkably refreshing change of pace from a Humpback.</div>

			<div class="content">Wow.... more snide replies to simple questions (not from all of you, mind you). Such impatience leaves a poor impession of you folks....
<br />
<br />Referring to me as an idiot simply because you've seen this subject before is simply uncalled for and unjustifiably rude.
<br />
<br />I'm getting quite a bad impression of this website, from the attitudes I'm seeing from some of the regs here. I am a reg at a number of other gaming sites, almost all of which have recurrent questions. Ya know what? We deal with 'em. Master of Orion 3 forum - there's at least 2 or 3 times a week someone asks the same old questions about missiles or fighter craft or whatnot.... but we're not rude to the people who ask simply because it's an old question. Just because it's a question I've seen dozens and dozens of times, and have answered many times myself, does not, in my opinion, justify rude behavior. Just because it's an old question to me does not mean that it's an old question to the chappie who asking it - if he's asking, it's because he wants to hear the answer. If I'm bored with it, I simply don't respond to it, and this, as far as I've seen, is by and large the usual way of handling things on the forums I go to - at least, the well-run and civilized ones.
<br />
<br />Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, there's a search button, thank you for your helpful clarification on that.... 
<br />
<br />Now here's the way I see it, and I grant you that my personal opinion isn't going to agree with many of yours, of course... I'm new at the game, I'm playing, and then there's something I need to find out... I can, of course, use the search button and end up with a list of a couple of hundred posts that may or may not be relevant to the question I seek an answer to, or I can just post the question, and if someone wants to answer me, they can... and if everybody else is bored with the question, well, they're obviously at liberty to simply not address it. I've got a home-based business I have to run, a wife, and a 6 month old son... I have precious little computer time, and what scraps of time I do manage to scrunge up, I don't want to waste looking through hundreds of posts hoping that I might find an answer - I want to spend that precious little time playing Freelancer, instead. Perhaps that might be construed as selfish of me, but I think in most cases, people would not find this to be unjustified. 
<br />
<br />If you guys have seen dozens of &quot;best ship&quot; threads, and are bored out of your minds with the subject.... then why, oh WHY do you take the time to not only open the threads and read the posts, but then also take the time to write out responses about how old the subject is and how you hate replying to them and how boring they are, etc. etc. etc... 
<br />
<br />How about this - if any given subject bores the arse off of you, just DON'T BOTHER WITH IT. Have some CONSIDERATION for the fact that some of the OTHER users of this forum may be new to the subject, but some users, in fact, may be willing to give polite and helpful answers to those who seek help. This raises an interesting question - WHO is this forum FOR? I think many of the regs here seem to think that this forum is theirs... it is not an open forum for the equal use of all, but rather the exclusive property of those who come here often enough to get bored with all of the usual questions. If this is, in fact, the truth, then I won't be returning here. I don't think that's the actual policy of the moderators, though... at least, I hope it isn't. I certainly hope, rather, that it is a forum for all players of the game, newbies or vets.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry if any of this has offended you guys with this ranting, but  I calls 'em as I sees 'em.
<br />
<br />P.S. - in my own defense, I'd like to simply point out that I did NOT at any time ask what was the best ship - I asked how well the Titan turns compared to two other ships. So sue me.

			<div class="content">Thank you, I do appreciate that. 
<br />
<br />Well, I do see that it's been posted many times before, and in order to comply with the wishes of those who took issue with my question, I've gone ahead and started searching the old posts for &quot;best ship&quot;.... which, I'd like to add, I am now doing INSTEAD of doing what I want to do, which is to play Freelancer.
<br />
<br />At any rate, the predictable problem has arisen - overflow of information. I never was much for data research, and this search has unsurprisingly yielded hundreds of threads, each with many posts, the majority of which simply aren't answering my question. I could take a day or two to try to read them all, which undoubtedly number close to 1000, but let's face it - it's not THAT important to me. So, given the options of taking too much time to try to dig up the answer myself or to not find out, I'll have to settle for not finding out... and of all things, I'm not allowed to ask.
<br />
<br />Now that I think of it, I challenge you, yourself, to take up your advice... do a search for &quot;best ship&quot; and find out how long it takes you to find out how fast the Titan turns, compared to either the Sabre or the Humpback. I only suggest this, in order to give you some reference point as to what those of us who don't know all of the old questions have to face in order to just find out what we want to know... you, sir, I doubt very much would have to use the search function often, as you seem to know quite a bit about the game and about many of the threads that have already come and gone. Those of use who are new here lack this asset.</div>

			<div class="content">Yo, I've played freelancer alot trust me, when I ordered it online i downloaded the demo which I played every hour of every day till i got the game which I completed in two days since i only got 11 hours sleep for both those days (5 for 1st day and 6 the 2nd) and I got the titan as soon as I could and played with it, but I got my ass whooped sooo bad! you know why? cos it flys like a brick just like alot of people say, I wanted to know if it was just me and it's not, My mate has a copy of my save game cos he wanted to try out the titan.
<br />
<br />He picked the saber over it and I picked the Eagle over the titan! I'm gonna try out my mates save game because he's got the saber but I've not had free time yet, with family coming up and stuff I'll let you know what I think of it!
<br />
<br />I hope this helped!

			<div class="content">i flew all vhf a while ago, i fly now in the defender and did div 43 missions with it (230k to 240k missions (only in MP)).
<br />
<br />titan, turnrate by speed 0 is 60
<br />- heaviest armor
<br />- mostest nano and batts (72/72)
<br />- with normal speed (80m/s) the slowest agility (that's why some say, it flies as a cow)
<br />- the turret can only fire backward
<br />
<br />sabre, turnrate by speed 0 is 60
<br />- medium armor
<br />- same nano and batts as the eagle (64 if i'm right)
<br />- with normal speed (80m/s) medium agility of the vhf
<br />- turret can shoot forward
<br />
<br />eagle, turnrate by speed 0 is 80 (they say... i'm not sure about that)
<br />- lightest armor of the 3 vhf with class 10 weaps
<br />- 64 (if i'm right) nano and batts
<br />- with normal speed (80m/s) the bestest agility of the 3 vhf with class 10 weaps
<br />- turret can't fire staight forward but 45 degrees to backward
<br />
<br />hammerhead, turnrate by speed 0 is 70 (if i'm right, can also be 75...)
<br />- lighter armor then the eagle
<br />- lowest nano and batts (don't know the exact numbers, but i thing about 50)
<br />- with normal speed (80m/s) is the agility (if i'm right) is about the same as the eagle (but feels a little strange if u ask me...)
<br />- turret can shoot forward<img src=smilies/icon_smile_question.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle><img src=smilies/icon_smile_question.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> (i don't know, flew 2 missions in it and changed it back to the dragon)
<br />
<br />
<br />i hoop u will read this and maybe cange something in here. and maybe u have founded something u wanded to know in here. if u can see i'm not sure about some things. i can also say this about some other ships what i like to fly with, but then it will be spam right now... co'z u asked only about the sabre and titan (but i gived u of all vhf what u can buy always (if u have enough money and can land on their bases/planets)).
<br />
<br />have fun playing...

			<div class="content">while the subject's been raised I might as well throw in my two penneth...I seem to remember having this very same argument with the regulars when I first started posting on these boards.  And it is fair to say that you do get your fair share of pubeless idiots, flaming newbies as soon as they ask a question...but I would advise you Larry to stick around, there ARE some genuinely cool people around these parts, and most would be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />The main point of my post is to raise the issue that the search engine here is really quite Sh*t!  Now, this isn't a complaint against TLR, because the site is superb and I'm sure that the Admin have got enough problems without having to make the search engine more useable.  What this is a complaint about is the people who burn down newbie posts by telling them to &quot;do a search idiot&quot;, when Larry is quite right in saying that you always end up with hundreds of completely pointless threads to plough through.  
<br />
<br />The whole idea behind a forum is to ask questions and get them answered, to discuss ideas and debate positions...if you don't have an answer don't post!! (a link to an known thread would do, which is exactly what Fear Factor did) sometimes I get the impression that people post pointless flames just to get their &quot;rankings&quot; up.  
<br />
<br />No doubt someone will reply saying this is a pointless flame and I'm just trying to get my ranking up <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  but I think its a valid point...
<br />
<br />Stick around Larry, but be prepared to rant about your wife or else you won't fit in. lol.</div>

			<div class="content">I am a big Sabre fan and a big Titan/Eagle hater <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Also, I'm glad you made this post 'cause i am new to best ship threads. So the titan has better armor. If you get in a battle where they take you that far down those extra few armor points and bots (relative to the sabre) will keep you alive for a few seconds more befor you meet the same death. And why would anybody want a turret that ONLY fires backward? Its half useless! And how often do you take the time to fire youy one gun behind you? In a Sabre you have the equivalent of 7 guns and one of them can shoot backward. BIG difference if you ask me. And manuverability, I confess the eagle is quite agile, but I bet I can A: dodge your fire and B: hit and kill you with the Sabres manuverability and speed just as well as in another eagle. (and I know I'm not the best pilot here, It's just an example) Plus, the Eagle and Titan have a tendancy to desintigrate when damaged. Not the Sabre! I'll keep my fancy guns thank you. So whats the decision? I chalange somone to show me how the Titan or Eagle is irrifutably better than the mighty Sabre!

			<div class="content">OKAY! LETS GET THIS POINT ACCROSS. IT ISN'T ABOUT THE SHIPS!!!
<br />
<br />It all depends on who is flying it. You might be and a saber and get whoooped on by me in a defender! Okay! It dosn't matter how much firepower or armor that you have... Its how you use it in battle. Sure a more advanced saber flier can whoop on the NPC's or n00bs in a titain/Eagle. But anybody can do that in almost any ship.
<br />
<br />
<br />It all boils down to what you like to fly. if you are comfertable in a saber, than so be it. But don't critisize others that don't see it the same way. 
<br />

<br />I think this topic has gone far enough and should be locked.</div>
