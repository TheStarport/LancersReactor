<br />
<br />But yes, this part of the story is all about Tanya and future parts wil focus more on what is hinted at in the beginning <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Battleship Miramoto silently coasted through space, holding a position a dozen kilometres away from Deshima Station, Shikoku System.
<br />
<br />It was a majestic sight, the huge array of dorsal and lateral fins spreading out from the capital ship, wings of fighters docking and taking-off every few minutes. The battleship was the pinnacle of Kusari military technology. Suddenly a fighter exploded in the midst of docking causing a huge fireball to erupt through the hangar bay and several levels above it. Men, shards of metal and various pieces of equipment blew out into the cold, unyielding space creating an expanding circle of force and debris.
<br />
<br />Aboard the battleship, all was chaos. Alarm klaxons were piercing the corridors, smoke and flames were creeping along the decks and the screams of the injured and dying filled the air.
<br />
<br />*** One week later ***
<br />
<br />&quot;By Kusari hells, it's clearly a Rheinland sabotage!&quot; screamed a minister. The Kusari man was standing with his fist raised angrily and shaking in the air as he spoke. &quot;The explosives used were Rheinland technology, traces of it were found in the hangar bay and adjacent decks. The fighter that docked with the Miramoto was a Banshee. The manifest indicated a Rheinland corporation as the owner of the ship. And the pilot, by Hiran. He was an ex-Rheinland Navy captain!&quot;
<br />
<br />He threw both hands above his head in frustration.
<br />
<br />&quot;Which part of 'Rheinland involvement' is unclear?&quot; he demanded.
<br />
<br />The council chamber based on New Tokyo was semi-circular in design. Twelve tiers rose above the main platform at the front of the chamber, each tier increasing in width. There were no empty seats, all one-hundred and twelve were taken for the first time in a hundred years. Of course, the topic was an important one and everybody wanted their say.
<br />
<br />&quot;Please, Akita-san. Your concerns were noted before our meeting,&quot; said Lord Takashi Akamoto. He looked much older since his return from Planet Hamburg. Beside him to his right sat his son, Kenji, still wearing the half-mask of metal and bore an expression of repressed anger and focus. To the senior man's left, sat a young Kusari woman. Her dark eyes gleamed as the various ministers had vented their anger in response to the bombing of the battleship. Her page-boy short hair was light and moved gently as she turned her head to observe each speaker.
<br />
<br />&quot;It is a well-known fact that records can be tampered with, ships purchased anonymously and unfortunately, weapons are too easy to acquire these days,&quot; continued Lord Akamoto. He shook his head and produced a white cloth, then proceeded to wipe his brow before placing it in his sleeve again. The minister stood up, his fist raised once more but not shaking.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lord Akamoto. With the greatest respect to one of our most honoured Kusari warriors. I acknowledge the fact you have a sympathy for the Rheinlanders. We of the council are aware of your peace treaty arranged a fortnight ago. We also are aware you attended a celebration on Rheinland territory.&quot;
<br />
<br />A general murmuring began amongst the council and hushed whispers echoed throughout the chamber.
<br />
<br />Akamoto sighed and smiled at the surprised minister.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. I visited Planet Hamburg two weeks ago, for their celebration of Night and Day. It is a glorious sight and reminisce of our own Victory Day that commemorates fallen soldiers in the Eighty-Years War. The Rheinlanders do not speak of the War. They are past the pain and have moved on, whilst we in Kusari, through Victory Day remember time and again how we won.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you saying we should abolish Victory Day?&quot; shouted the minister, swiftly followed by a chorus of boos and chants.
<br />
<br />&quot;No. I am saying if we are to cast blame on the Rheinlanders for attacking our battleships, let us first be sure of the evidence before we begin to celebrate a second Victory Day!&quot; replied Akamoto forcefully. &quot;And this time, we may not win!&quot;
<br />
<br />The council chamber was silent as they reflected on his words. Until now, the Emperor had not spoken. He was a man in his late forties, a sharp widow's peak and slightly larger than normal nose for a Kusari gave him a piercing, hawk-like look. His eyes surveyed the council as he listened to the various arguments riposted back and forth.
<br />
<br />&quot;Friends. We have no proof that Rheinland are to blame for the attack on our battleship,&quot; he said in a deep, powerful voice. The council hushed completely as they listened to their Emperor. &quot;But this does not mean we should remain open to another attack. Double our forces at all jump gates into Kusari. Give the military more opportunity to scan all vessels. Any ship carrying explosives is to be quarantined until it's origin can be confirmed. My fellow Kusari, we are not enemies of Rheinland anymore. Remember that. The war is over.&quot;
<br />
<br />The council nodded in response as one.
<br />
<br />Kenji looked over to the girl who returned his cold gaze, then ran her tongue over her bottom lip suggestively. Kenji smiled, though his metallic face ended up more as a grimace.
<br />
<br />

<br />Outside the council chamber, the various ministers and their companions were boarding their shuttles and skycabs to journey onto their next destination. Lord Akamoto was waiting outside looking up at the night sky when Kenji and the girl approached.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, my son. And Hideko, of course,&quot; he said nodding to the girl. &quot;I am going on vacation now. I must return to Honshu and see your uncle. He does not have much longer now. Kenji. I leave you in charge of our operations. I trust you will manage them well. Hideko. Look after him, my dear,&quot; said Akamoto.
<br />
<br />Kenji nodded then bowed. Hideko merely curtsied slightly, though her eyes were fixed on Akamoto's, something she had never done before. Akamoto was annoyed but ignored it. It was a while since Kenji had smiled and this strange silent girl had brought some happiness back into his life.
<br />
<br />&quot;Take good care of yourselves!&quot; said Akamoto cheerfully. He turned round and walked onto his private shuttle. Moments later it was shooting upwards towards space.
<br />
<br />Then exploded in a ball of flame.
<br />
<br />On the ground, Hideko watched the exploding pieces of the shuttle cause chaos in the sky lanes as speeding vehicles flew into or around the falling debris.
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you sad, my love?&quot; she asked Kenji, a curious gleam in her eye. The cyborg turned his red prosthetic eye and suddenly grabbed her waist using his robotic arm, pulling the girl closer to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;I want you. Now,&quot; he said gruffly and began to run his human hand over her back.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whatever you wish my love,&quot; she whispered. &quot;My, Lord now,&quot; she said, a slow smile appearing but never reaching her eyes. Kenji kissed her deeply, then noticed a tattoo of stripes upon the side of her neck and a series of circular scars. He wanted to say something, but was lost in a haze of passion.
<br />

<br />***
<br />
<br />Tanya and Travis arrived in Liberty space after a week of travelling through independent systems. Tanya had bought a Falcon heavy fighter, Travis sold his ship and bought a humpback. They would be less suspicious if they travelled as mule and escort and given the increasing number of freelancers they would just one of many.
<br />
<br />During their flight through Liberty, they found the jump gates to Kepler and Galileo blockaded by Liberty cruisers and dozen wings of Defenders.
<br />
<br />&quot;What's going on Travis?&quot; asked Tanya. There was a growing queue of fighters, transports and freighters at the end of a trade lane nearest the jump gate.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know, babe. Let me find out,&quot; he replied. He targeted a Defender close by and hailed it.
<br />
<br />&quot;Freelancer, I don't have time to talk now,&quot; was the curt response. Lieutenant Jason Abrams was the pilot of this ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh, Lieutenant Abrams. This is freelancer, alpha-zero-dash-zero-one. We're carrying expendable cargo in the form of luxury food. It's perishing fast. Can you tell me what the delay is about?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Freelancer, apologies for the inconvenience. A number of key ministers have been assassinated in Kusari, Bretonia, Rheinland and Liberty. We're scanning all traffic passing through the jump gates. You will just have to wait in line. Out.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis switched comm channels.
<br />
<br />&quot;You hear that, Tanya? I wonder who died to make everyone so jumpy. I haven't seen this number of cap-ships out since the end of the Nomad Wars.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya bit her lip.
<br />
<br />&quot;Something is very wrong, Travis. That lieutenant said 'a number of key ministers' were assassinated. It sounds far too co-ordinated to be a coincidence. Somebody is trying to create tension. Start a war. Or at least, raise the stakes.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Right. But whatever happens, we have to get to Kusari and take out those Blood Dragons. With those monkeys off our backs we'll be able to move around more freely.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You're an idiot, Travis. What on earth did you get into debt with them for?&quot; she asked. The response was a long-time coming.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well. I started gambling and..&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok stop. I don't want to know how someone with years of training and investment could find themselves in such a ridiculous position,&quot; replied Tanya in disgust.
<br />
<br />Travis laughed.
<br />
<br />&quot;One of these days babe, you're gonna thank me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What for?&quot; she asked incredulous and astonished as his cheek.
<br />
<br />&quot;For putting up with you!&quot; he retorted. Before she could reply, he set a new waypoint. &quot;Heading to Kepler jump hole. Come with. Or queue. Your choice.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis pulled his Humpback out of formation and engaged his cruise thrusters. Tanya cursed and joined him.
<br />
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br />Two Outcast sabres floated powered-down twenty klicks from New Tokyo, hiding in the shadow of the planet.
<br />
<br />&quot;Is everything set?&quot; asked one man in Hispanic.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. It is all ready. You may tell our people to begin.&quot;
<br />
<br />The first man pressed a series of buttons on his control panel, then nodded when he heard a number of beeps in response.
<br />
<br />&quot;All our agents have completed their missions. The results were predictable. All traffic throughout the Sirius heartlands has been slowed and military forces in the border worlds and independent systems are being recalled for internal security.&quot;
<br />
<br />His companion considered this for a few minutes.
<br />
<br />&quot;Then we are free to continue stage two. Tell the Don our mission is complete. Now, we take our revenge,&quot; he hissed.
<br />

			<div class="content">&quot;There it is,&quot; sighed Travis. &quot;The House of Thousand Orchids.&quot;
<br />
<br />The bounty hunter theatrically cast his arm aside, presenting the building to Tanya who waited impatiently next to him. The pair had landed on Shikoku Station two hours ago and only just left the docking bay terminus. The increased security tripled all entry and exit times, forcing them to arrive with minutes to spare at their arranged meeting. Tanya wanted to arrive much earlier so she could survey the area first and was annoyed at having to go in 'cold'.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is your fault, Travis,&quot; she chided. &quot;If you hadn't tried to make a pass at that Immigation Officer, her colleague would have let us go by without problems. Try thinking with your HUD, not your Cannonball in future.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis shrugged.
<br />
<br />&quot;Babe. She had huge..&quot; he began but was interrupted by a raised hand from Tanya.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wait. There they are. Perhaps ten altogether,&quot; she counted quickly. They were parked in a hired skycab opposite the massage parlour, observing the group leaving their convoy of vehicles and walking purposefully into the building. Tanya suddenly frowned and Travis chuckled.
<br />
<br />&quot;What's the matter, their dress sense wrong for the season?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Shush. Look there, that girl,&quot; said Tanya, pointing to a young Kusari woman in her early twenties. &quot;Have you seen her before?&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis studied her for a few moments and watched the attractive girl walk up the steps slowly, her hips swaying as though in time to a song he couldn't hear. The split in her traditional dress revealed shapely toned legs. His eyebrow raised questioningly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, now I have seen her, perhaps I should try and see a little more of her, 'eh?&quot; he said with a smirk.
<br />
<br />Tanya sighed.
<br />
<br />&quot;That girl was with Kenji Akamoto at a ball. I've known Kenji for a couple years but I have never seen her before.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You were at a ball?&quot; asked Travis incredulously. &quot;From government assassin to escort girl? And you tell me off for gambling?&quot; Travis shook his head but fell silent under Tanya's withering glare.
<br />
<br />&quot;Just be quiet for a minute and let me finish,&quot; she demanded. &quot;That girl is at least, an aide if not companion to a senior figure in one of the greatest bounty hunter clans in Sirius history. You should know the Akamoto Clan are in the top flight of combat pilots. She doesn't belong in a place like this.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis nodded but said nothing. Tanya continued.
<br />
<br />&quot;Kenji never mentioned her before.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Jealous?&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya punched him on the shoulder and he yelped in surprise.
<br />
<br />&quot;Idiot. I'm saying that I've never seen her before until his..return from captivity. You should remember that, at least,&quot; she hissed.
<br />
<br />Travis looked away.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tanya, I'm sorry that ever happened okay? I didn't mean for you or your Kusari buddy to get hurt. Serious. I was just doing the job.&quot;
<br />
<br />There was a pregnant silence as they both sat looking out of opposite windows lost in their thoughts. Tanya was the first to speak after several long minutes.
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine. I'm over it. But she is dangerous. There's something very wrong about her. I won't be in there with you, so watch her, okay?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;When you say wrong, you mean, she moves like an assassin, right?&quot; he asked, a slight twitch at his left eye betraying minute signs of nervousness.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, perhaps not an assassin. Not like us. Like we were. But at least she's trained, or enhanced. Or on drugs. I don't know!&quot; sighed Tanya. &quot;Just be careful. She's an unknown element and that's enough to make me cautious.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You're paranoid, girl,&quot; laughed Travis. &quot;I'll be fine. I'd better make tracks before I'm more than fashionably late.&quot;
<br />
<br />They held each other's gaze for a moment and Tanya felt a rush of blood to her head and heart miss a beat. She coughed and fidgeted with her comm controls.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'll be up on the building here. I can track you through the transmitter you swallowed. The multi-imaging device will do the rest, if there's trouble.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis looked over his shoulder at the butt of a long-rifled weapon resting on the back seat, partially wrapped in a dark material.
<br />
<br />&quot;I hope that thing is worth the money,&quot; he said. &quot;We may need to pick up some Engine Components if we ever pass by Magellan again.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis got out the sky cab.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tanya?&quot;
<br />
<br />He looked inside at Tanya once more before closing the door.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Keep those beautiful green eyes on me.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis closed the door and ran across the street to The House of Thousand Orchids.
<br />
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br />
<br />The interior of The House of Thousand Orchids was orchestrated debauchery and carnage at best. Pure unadulterated primal passion at worst. Travis grinned as he saw a number of patrons and customers doing what can only be described as &quot;bad things&quot; with escort girls often half their age. Pumping music echoed throughout the lounge, punctuated only by occasional squeals of deligh. The lights were filtered dark-red providing the lounge with a sense of surrealism.
<br />
<br />Travis saw the Blood Dragon clan leader he was looking for. It didn't take long, 'Antoine' as he preferred to be known as, was seated at the largest and clearly most prestigious table at the back of the lounge, his entourage now doubled from the arrival of several courtesans.
<br />
<br />The bounty hunter smiled to himself as he considered his meeting. Antoine, a half-Kusari and Liberty Blood Dragon clan leader, who virtually had forsaken his Kusari roots and religious beliefs to indulge in 'foreign' pleasures. Travis and Tanya could be doing the Kusari world a favour. Hopefully it wouldn't come to that.
<br />
<br />He approached the table, sub-consciously licking his lips when the Kusari girl that Tanya pointed out earlier noticed and turned to face him. Her dark-brown eyes focused on his own and she lowered her head slightly as he stood before the table. Travis wondered what she was looking at but turned his attention back to Antoine and waited for him to notice his arrival. One of Antoine's guards tapped the clan leader lightly on the shoulder and spoke softly into his ear.
<br />
<br />&quot;Antoine. I'm Travis Carter. Remember me?&quot; said Travis in an even, measured tone. &quot;I'm back. With your money,&quot; Travis produced a cred-stick and placed it on the table.
<br />
<br />The clan leader looked up then with several quick 'shoo-ing' hand motions dismissed the girls crawling over their table until only he, the girl and his guards remained.
<br />
<br />&quot;So. The White Tiger returns. Please, sit. Have a drink.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis glanced around quickly. There were seven guards, all with their hands under the jackets waiting for a kill order. The girl was seated next to Antoine. Before he could react, two more men appeared behind him and placed a hand on each of his shoulders. A chair was brought for him and sat, reluctantly.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't have a lot of time to spare,&quot; began Travis. &quot;Let's just get this over and done with. Give me a cred-stick I can..&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Forgive me if I take my time, Mr Carter,&quot; interrupted Antoine. He laughed, a sickly, staccato sound.
<br />
<br />To Travis' relief he heard Tanya's cool, lilting voice in his ear.
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Relax, hotshot. You've been in worse situations than this. Listen to what he says, pay him, then leave. He's only toying with you.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Nice of you to empathise with him so well, babe,&quot; </i> he sub-vocalised a reply.
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine. One drink,&quot; he said aloud and nodded in thanks as the girl poured what appeared to be wine into a small cup. He raised it. &quot;To better times.&quot; And drank it.
<br />
<br />&quot;So tell me, Mr Travis. What has a rogue like you been up to recently? Killed anyone? Like a minister perhaps?&quot; asked Antoine. His eyes had a deadly gleam to them.
<br />
<br />Travis returned his gaze coolly.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know what you're talking about, Antoine. I heard that a couple of senior people had been killed, it's what caused my delay. Fracking immigration delays and security.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I see, I see. Perhaps I'm not being clear enough. You killed Lord Takashi Akamoto.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? What are you talking about? I was three systems away at the time it happened!&quot; said Travis rising, but strong hands clamped onto his shoulders forcing him down into his chair again.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, yes. It's all clear. You see, the fingerprints you have kindly supplied to us,&quot; Antoined smiled as the girl using a gloved hand deftly plucked the cup Travis set down off the table and placed it into a bag. &quot;Will identify you as a freelancer killer. You were responsible for killing one of the most beloved of our warriors. A decorated man. An honourable man.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A dead man,&quot; whispered the girl, who spoke for the first time. Bemused, she watched Travis who's face was now a picture of horror.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, Mr Travis. You have nowhere to hide. We will have our people at the Kusari Navy merely use your prints and DNA as evidence to prove you were responsible. Then you will be executed. And no-one will ever know.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Know what?&quot; Travis asked drowsily. He put his hand on the table to steady himself as sudden nausea gripped him.
<br />
<br />&quot;That the Outcasts will prevail as we have planned to for many years now,&quot; said Antoine coldly.
<br />
<br />&quot;You're..an Outcast?&quot; asked Travis slipping into unconsciousness. Antoine laughed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes! Mr Carter. We all are now! Cardamine is the elixir of Elysium. And the Outcasts are our new gods. Worship them.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Or perish,&quot; said the girl, now standing over Travis. She kissed him. Travis whispered but was losing control of his senses and couldn't speak very loudly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Did he say something?&quot; asked Antoine. The girl leaning over Travis nodded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Something like 'she's coming',&quot; repeated the girl.
<br />
<br />Antoine stood for a moment, his face impassive. Then burst out into laughter the rest of his comrades joining him.
<br />
