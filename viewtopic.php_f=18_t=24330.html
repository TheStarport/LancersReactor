			<div class="content">You'ved closed every &quot;fun&quot; and important topic here. You are abusing your power. Bakedpotatoe already knows, and he told barigb, who im not sure will do anything. But my god, you have just become a nuicanse. Before you think im just talking out of my ass, let's find a few examples.
<br />
<br />1) &quot;Much Uba About Nothing&quot;
<br />
<br />that thread was a nice funny thread to track down the guys post FOR ANOTHER MODERATOR. But no, this thread has thus been deemed USELESS by a moderator who clearly doesn't deserve half his powers.
<br />
<br />2) A Reminder for the Incompitent About The Cloaking Mod
<br />
<br />heres my thread. it was a reminder for people about the damn mod, and what not to use it for. no info on how to create it was disclosed. then it turned into a discussion. last time i checked, discussions are ok. or have we lost all freedom in the world and its doomed? hm...
<br />
<br />also, this thread was a news item. thats what i intended it for. i made it, then sent the link to TLR (namingly baked potatoe, as he does most of these submissions), and it got put up in the news. then for reasons unknown you pull yet another stupid move, let all your power go to your head, and close it, just because people were talking about it, and giving ideas of fairer versions of cloak, and better anticloaks. it was actually pretty helpful.
<br />
<br />3) Ahh. Lab Mice We Are
<br />
<br />Someone states an opinion about how we are acting. He tells us its ridiculous. You decide that since you didn't agree with his opinion, you must close it. One again, abuse.
<br />
<br />4) Cloaking finally achieved... then THIS
<br />
<br />well here we have a nice intelligent discussion once again about cloaking. we enlighten a few people why it wouldn't work, dire wolf enlightens me to stop bugging him and treating him like a n00b. we make peace. we start to brainstorm more ideas. then you deem the thread not useful anymore, and close it. WTF? if something isn't useful to you, it must be cloased? I sure as hell hope you never become president of america or of germany...
<br />
<br />
<br />Don't think i dont know squat abou being a moderator. at some sites, I AM a moderator. ive abused power, gotten in trouble for it, then been demodded. a week later they remodded me, and i was fine. ive seen abuse, but ive also seen NORMAL moderators who dont close anything they are bored with. 
<br />
<br />don't think im the only one thinking this. ive talked to wanderer through MSN. the person who recreated the lab mice thread had said &quot;for some strange reason, my other topic was closed, so ill try again.&quot; in one of the debate threads i told someone to leave cloak out of the debate so you wouldn't close the thread. his response was something close to &quot;yeah, but i wanted to make the point&quot;
<br />
<br />im sure this will be closed in a heartbeat. maybe im risking my acount. but close and/or ban me, and people wont exactly look at you any better. in fact, since im not flaming you, and im proving points, it will only make things for you look worse than they already look.</div>

			<div class="content">The good and bad of it - to put it mildly, someone is actively moderating the mods forums. To get help with the uba incident, i had to email stinger to get  some moderator action up. When the guy reposted, i had to email stinger again (we thought he would have left it) and again as it broke into chaos. Did anyone else email admin about it? I didn't hear anything, someone would have emailed the admin eventually, but how long??.
<br />
<br /> So it might be good for a moderator to come along and check out the forums, and close certain threads. Flaming isn't tolerated in threads, but its been rife in this forum for a while (no moderators constant presence) unlike in the general forums. 
<br />
<br />I think wassups disagreement, shouldn't be with his actions, but that maybe some people in this forum would prefer to have a less 'militant' presence, ie - allowing threads that would be locked in other forums continue due to our more 'laid back ways'?? Not sure if that is a good way of saying it, but who cares!!</div>

<br />
<br />Of course it was useful. Emphasize on &quot;was&quot;. The guy is gone, and the thread was sinking anyway until someone decides that he didn't get his share of flaming of the guy and wanted to practice necromancy on a dead conflict. What is the sole purpose of the resurrection? flame and spamming for post counts. I closed it, no regrets or remorse.

<br />Bargib and I disagreed on this last point. We both thought that the discussion was dead, although he didn't think it deserved a lock. This is the our exact conversation:
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>I understand your feeling, and I tend to agree!
<br />
<br />Though I would not have locked the topic, but maybe posted saying that if people feel they can add to the subject, then post away, but try to move the topic along instead of back and forth... <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Close call... I know... Just wanted to forward the feedback...
<br />
<br />People have a tendency to react quite harshly to locked topics, so I usally only do it with flames or similar... Also if the discussion is way off the original topic, then I lock..
<br />
<br />Keep it up! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_clown.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />&gt; Yes, I made a judgement call on that topic. IMO, it was 6 pages of
<br />back-and-forth argument that could not be resolved. Not exactly hardcore flame war, but it was going stale. Please see for yourself.

<br />&gt; If you agree with Wassup, however, I'll unlock the thread and/or 
<br />&gt; sticky it
<br />to raise future awareness about similar topic. Your call. Either way, I will adhere to your advise about asking the other mods in the future <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.

<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; FYI - remember use your powers lightly - maybe you could try asking 
<br />&gt; one of
<br />the other mods if a topic should be closed before doing it - if at all in
<br />doubt...: <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I asked him if I should unlock the topic, but he basically left it unanswered - but he did after all decided that it didn't deserve to be locked - so I'll unlock it if you want me to. Your call <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. My apologies on this one.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>3) Ahh. Lab Mice We Are
<br />
<br />Someone states an opinion about how we are acting. He tells us its ridiculous. You decide that since you didn't agree with his opinion, you must close it. One again, abuse. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Ok, here's some of the content of that thead: <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>I live in america and i didin't care when the twin towers fell. i wasint sad or happy that thoes peopel died. I am onley 14 to.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />And these follow: <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Well, in that case, why do you hang round a well populated forum at all? Nah - methinks you are someone who likes to get a kick out of trying to annoy people. Your post is only there to try and get everyone riled up and provoke them. 
<br />
<br />Luckily, poeple see this and haven't bothered posting. You posted in the editing forums hoping to get a strong response about it (you know most of the regular posters have been here a while and don't pk at all), and when that failed, you turned to a very controversial personalised view that was posted to obviously incite some other response instead <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />That was one guy's opinion on the post. I'm not crazy enough to let a thread so politically loaded in the forum. Not on my watch. How long do you think before people notice and start telling him to go live in [insert name of repressively governed country here because he hated America so much? I might not be psychic, but I do have instincts, and it's only common sense to predict that it will escalate into a flame war.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>) Cloaking finally achieved... then THIS
<br />
<br />well here we have a nice intelligent discussion once again about cloaking. we enlighten a few people why it wouldn't work, dire wolf enlightens me to stop bugging him and treating him like a n00b. we make peace. we start to brainstorm more ideas. then you deem the thread not useful anymore, and close it.

<br />
<br />I do not see the problem here. Threads have been locked for less, according to my 3 years I spend here since SL era. Threads in the FL Discussion forum have been locked, NOT moved to Spoilers, if it contains spoilers. 
<br />Even people who participated in that thread agreed that there was nothing more to be said. And it was not locked because of flame or improper conduct, I grant you, but because it would be better to start a new thread, because it would be better to start with a clean slate, forgetting your past animosity with Dire Wolf. You did make peace with him - but it's hard to get back on the topic after that show. Just start a new thread with the same topic, as I said in that thread, and I'll leave it alone - provided you stay in line.
<br />
<br />And finally, I want to state that I take full responsibilities for my actions. I could have locked those threads anonymously, and you'd have no one to bash. I maybe born yesterday as a moderator, and you might outclass me in moderating matter, but I have been here since year 2000, and excuse me when I claim that I know more about this place's climate a little bit more than you do.
<br />
<br />I'm here to stay until I die or until Bargib finds someone better.</div>

			<div class="content">Fear-Factor stated:<font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Of course it was useful. Emphasize on &quot;was&quot;. The guy is gone, and the thread was sinking anyway until someone decides that he didn't get his share of flaming of the guy and wanted to practice necromancy on a dead conflict. What is the sole purpose of the resurrection? flame and spamming for post counts. I closed it, no regrets or remorse.    <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />First, my thread was for comedy, not flaming.  The thread was revisited because someone didn't know what had happened.
<br />
<br />Killzone asked: <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>who was this prick? If hes as bad as he sounds, Ive just found someone I want to hurt more than Bill Gates!!! Im guessing he made some comment or another.... No idea ...    <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I answered his question.  He did express his want to hate this person, but he needed to be informed as to why all the commotion about Uba had been caused.  It didn't mean he was going to start flaming by saying, &quot;Good riddence of the ****er&quot; or something.  He knew Uba was disruptive and needed to know why.  And I did not result to name calling, my description was descriptive.
<br />
<br />Quote from me: <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>He was a dastardly perveyor of explicit anarchist material that could have spelled doom for online gamers who enjoy Freelancer.    <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />All this was true.  He was dastardly, he was a perveyor of explicit anarchistic material (according to Freelancer gaming), and that material could have spelled doom to online gamers.
<br />
<br />Second, my thread was for the mates after a championship game celebrating together the conquest of the other team.  It was all in fun and we enjoyed the comraderee.  A toast to the effort, if you will.
<br />
<br />In Wassups thread, I had an excellent discussion with Rubicon about the two sides of cloak.  I presented my ideas and my position with rationale, logic and good manners, I had no intention of continuing the debate, but someone else may have been able to pick it up if they wanted.  I think the thread should be unlocked, but not on my behalf.
<br />
<br />Wassups thread as a whole was intelligent.
<br />
<br />My thread was comedic and funny.
<br />
<br />I don't think there were good reasons to close either.  A simple warning about potential flaming would have sufficed in my thread.

<br />seriously though, admin are admin, they're here to help everyone, if you don't like their decisions its kinda tough...especially considering they were mostly voted in by the general populus anway! by arguing with them you are doing yourself no favours.
<br />
<br />this thread should be locked, deleted and sunk to the bottom of the ocean with a chunk of rock tied to its ankles.  if there are any complaints about admin, surely the best way to deal with it would be to complain to the other admin or as a last effort, direct to Bargib....?</div>

			<div class="content">I personally think that this forum has been without a moderator for so long we have forgotten what they are. Reason for Stingers appearance at uba incident was cos i emailed him about it.......repeatedly. Go take a look in the other forums as to what on earth warrents a locking, and you find that this is (apart from perhaps one or two threads) been easily fulfilled. Flaming was rampant in all but the spectrespeare thread. Admittedly it wasn't outright 'you are a f******' sorta flaming, but it was getting close at times.
<br />
<br /> Perhaps this will tone down what has recently become a 'say stuff and to hell with everyone' attitude that has prevailed. The guy who posted very nasty things about america etc, check the date.........that should have been deleted, not locked. Other threads were just rehasing the same point over and over again. See convincing of Render on not to post cloak stuff, to then only have the same quarrel with another load of peoeple who couldn't be arsed to read the other posts. That would have carried on. Poeple want to make there point, regardless of whether it has been made 10 times previously. If you don't mind that, then it shouldn't be locked......otherwise....
<br />
<br /> I find it enlightening that when a moderator shows up and does something, all  hell breaks loose that he oversteps his bounds...........ask yourself this,
<br />
<br />  Would any of those threads stayed open even 1/4 the time in the general discussion forum? 
<br />
<br />NO is the answer,
<br />
<br />why then are the 'rules' supposed to be different here?
<br />
<br />Just my point of view. Like usual, you can agree, or disagree. but this forum DOES need moderating, just like the others.</div>

<br />
<br />Need I go on? not to insult the other moderators closing these threads - I fully believe they are doing a fine job. I'm just saying that threads have been locked for less, much less. My predecessors did not frequent these Editing forums enough, and I believe that's why you are not used to the level of moderation the rest of these forums enjoy/suffer (depending on your point of view). All I did was to bring these forums up to the standards implemented on the other forums. How would I know that these forums would turn spammy? I wouldn't, actually. It's just experience doing the deeds. And I actually take time moving rogue threads to where they belong instead of simply locking them. Bargib, if you're reading this - and you feel that I am guilty of abuse, then by all means demote me. I would only say that I joined the community in the 1st place because I saw how clean, well-mannered, and spam-free this community is. And we owed that to tight moderating.
