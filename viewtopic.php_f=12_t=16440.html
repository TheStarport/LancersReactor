<br /><b>You might be a Net-Head if...  </b>
<br />
<br />When someone refers to a CD you don&#8217;t think of a way to store money or music. 
<br />
<br />When someone asks for your address you give them a line of text that includes HTTP:// or @. 
<br />
<br />Your kids have to e-mail you just to get your attention. 
<br />
<br />You can type faster than you can talk. 
<br />
<br />Your best friends have names like [cedFire, Sk8er, CyberBob or TheEnforcer. 
<br />
<br />Your computer is worth more than your car. 
<br />
<br />You can understand modem squeal. 
<br />
<br />You can whistle at 33.6. 
<br />
<br />You have seen HACKERS more than .02k times. 
<br />
<br />If you figured out the math in the last line but you have to have a computer to balance your checkbook. 
<br />
<br />You think that Bite is spelled BYTE. 
<br />
<br />You use the acronyms LOL, BRB, AFK, ROFL, RTMF, BTW, LMAO or BTDT even when you are talking to people 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Don&#180;t name your dog &#180;Sex&#180;!! </b>
<br />
<br />When people buy a dog, they usually name him something like Rover or Bowser. Well I chose to name my dog &quot;Sex&quot;. But lately Sex has been a little embarassing to me. 
<br />I remember one day I took Sex to City Hall to get a license for him. I went up to the clerk and said &quot;I would like to have a license for Sex&quot;. He said he would like to have one too. I said &quot;You don't understand, I've had Sex since I was nine years old&quot;. He said I must have been quite a kid. 
<br />
<br />Last year they were auditioning dogs for a commercial on dog food. I took Sex to the studio to see if he would get the part. But suddenly Sex started to run off around the studio. I went after him, but the crew manager grabbed my arm and asked what I was doing here. I told him I was hoping to have Sex on TV. He called me a showoff. 
<br />
<br />One day Sex ran out on me in the middle of the night. I went around the neighbourhood looking for him. A cop came and asked what I was doing. I told him I was looking for Sex. My case comes up this Friday... 
<br />

<br />
<br />Anyway, I HAVE learned to use my resources and I decided to use them today <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Besides, I have lots of resources and I never run out of them (why the hell do you think I'm part of the ' Funny Bastards Guild ' ?), so I really don't care that there were already some ' Funny' threads today. I think we (people that is) should laugh more in their lives. Remember, laughter will greatly enhance your lifespan ! We can never have enough laughter...
<br />
<br />Enough about that ! Let me post some more funny stuff <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br /><b>101 things NOT to say during sex !  </b>
<br />
<br />1. But everybody looks funny naked!
<br />2. You woke me up for that?
<br />3. Did I mention the video camera?
<br />4. Do you smell something burning?
<br />5. (in a janitor's closet) And they say romance is dead...
<br />6. Try breathing through your nose.
<br />7. A little rug burn never hurt anyone!

<br /><b>Especially for Zeratural (on special request <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)................Mexican jokes !!  </b>
<br />
<br />How many officers does it take to arrest a Mexican Guy?
<br />It takes 4; 1 to arrest him and 3 to carry his oranges.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />There is an American, a German, and a Mexican.
<br />They are in all in a boat.
<br />The boat is about to sink.
<br />Each of them have to throw things out to make the boat lighter!
<br />The German throws out 4 cases of beer and says:
<br />&quot;We have a lot of bear in Germany so we don't need these!&quot;
<br />The Mexican throws out 5 cases of burritos and says:
<br />&quot;We have a lot of burritos in Mexico so we don't need these!&quot; 
<br />The American grabs the Mexican and throws him out.
<br />The German asks why he threw the Mexican out.
<br />And the American replies: 
<br />&quot;We have a lot of Mexicans in America so we don't need him!.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />There was a German, an American, and a Mexican.
<br />They were walking in the woods.
<br />Suddenly a heard of buffalo came at them.
<br />They ran and ran until they saw a shack and went in it.
<br />2 days later the buffalo left.
<br />The men got out of the shack only to find layers of crap everywhere!
<br />They were forced to jump in because there was no way out.
<br />The German took a leap and said,
<br />&quot; It's not bad, it's only up to my waist. &quot;
<br />The American took a leap and said, &quot; It's not bad, it's only up to my knees. &quot; Then the Mexican took a leap and said, &quot; It's not bad, it's only up to my ankles. &quot; The American asked, &quot; How did you do that. &quot; The Mexican replied in a muffled voice, &quot; I jumped in head first. &quot; 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Why do Mexicans re-fry their beans? Have you seen a Mexican do anything right the first time?
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Why do Mexicans eat Tomales for Christmas?
<br />So they have something to unwrap
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />What are the first three words in every Mexican cookbook?
<br />&quot;Steal a chicken...&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />What are the first 3 words in the Mexican national anthem?
<br />&quot;Attention K-Mart shoppers.&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />What kind of cans are there in Mexico? 
<br />Mexicans. 
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />There were three guys, an American, a Canadian, and a Mexican. They had been travelling for days and were very, hungry. They came across a farm that had hundreds of fruits. While they were eating, the farmer came out and caught them. 
<br />The farmer said, &quot;Since I'm in a good mood today, I won't kill you... If you stuff 100 of your favorite fruit up your ass without laughing. 
<br />The American was up first. He chose cherries as his favorite fruit. He got up to 78 and burst out laghing. So the farmer shot him with a shotgun. 
<br />The Canadian was next and chose grapes. He got up to 92 but started laughing so the farmer killed him too. 
<br />When the Canadian and the American arrived up in heaven, an angel asked them why they laughed. 
<br />They both replied, &quot;We saw the Mexican with watermelons.&quot; 
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />A US Border Patrol Agent catches an illegal alien in the bushes right by the border fence, he pulls him out and says &quot;Sorry, you know the law, you've got to go back across the border right now.&quot; 
<br />The mexican man pleads with them, &quot;No, noooo Senior, I must stay in de USA! Pleeeze!&quot; 
<br />The Border Patrol Agent thinks to himself, I'm going to make it hard for him and says &quot;Ok, I'll let you stay if you can use 3 english words in a sentence&quot;. 
<br />The Mexican man of course agrees. 
<br />The Border Patrol Agent tells him, &quot;The 3 words are: Green, Pink and Yellow. Now use them in 1 sentence.&quot; 
<br />The Mexican man thinks really hard for about 2 minutes, then says, &quot;Hmmm, Ok. The phone, it went Green, Green, Green, I Pink it up and sez Yellow?&quot; 
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />An Englishman, Frenchman, Mexican, and Texan were flying across country on a small plane when the pilot comes on the loud speaker and says &quot; We're having mechanical problems and the only way we can make it to the next airport is for 3 of you to open the door and jump, at least one of you can survive&quot;
<br />The four open the door and look out below. The Englishman takes a deep breath and hollers &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; and jumps.
<br />The Frenchman gets really inspired and hollers &quot;Viva La France&quot; and he also jumps.
<br />This really pumps up the Texan so he hollers &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; and he grabs the Mexican and throws him out of the plane. 
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Two guys are bungee-jumping one day. The first guy says to the second. &quot;You know, we could make a lot of money running our own bungee-jumping service in Mexico.&quot;
<br />The second guy thinks this is a great idea, so the two pool their money and buy everything they'll need - a tower, an elastic cord, insurance, etc.
<br />They travel to Mexico and begin to set up on the square. As they are constructing the tower, a crowd begins to assemble. Slowly, more and more people gather to watch them at work.
<br />The first guy jumps. He bounces at the end of the cord, but when he comes back up, the second guy notices that he has a few cuts and scratches. Unfortunately, the second guy isn't able catch him, he falls again, bounces and comes back up again.
<br />This time, he is bruised and bleeding. Again, the second guy misses him. The first guy falls again and bounces back up. This time, he comes back pretty messed up - he's got a couple of broken bones and is almost unconscious.
<br />Luckily, the second guy finally catches him this time and says, &quot;What happened? Was the cord too long?&quot;
<br />The first guy says, &quot;No, the cord was fine, but what the heck is a 'pinata'?&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Why did God give Mexicans noses?
<br />So they'll have something to pick in the winter.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />why doesnt mexico have a olympic team? Because everyone that can run, jump, and swim is already across the border!!
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Q: What do you get when you cross a Mexican and an Iranian? 
<br />A: Oil of Ol'e.

			<div class="content">Here's the lastest ones I've heard.
<br />
<br />1. A lady owns two female parrots that only say, &quot;hey, sailor.  Wanna have a good time?&quot;  And she's had it and asks a priest what she could do about them.  The priest says, &quot;I have two male parrots that only pray and say quotes from the Bible.  If you put your parrots in with mine they'll teach your parrots to say good things.&quot;  The lady agrees so she brings her parrots over to the church.  The priest's parrots are sitting in their cage reading their Bibles and praying.  The lady puts her parrots in the cage and one of them says, &quot;hey sailor.  Wanna have a good time?&quot; and one of the priest's parrots says to the other, &quot;throw down your Bible, our prayers have been answered.
<br />
<br />2. A guy is sitting around in a bar and he notices an attractive woman sitting at a table by herself.  He waits around and builds up his courage then he goes over and sits down by her.  He says, &quot;excuse me, but would it be alright if I sat here and we chatted?&quot;  The woman says really loud, &quot;no, I will not sleep with you!&quot;  Everyone's staring at the guy and he gets all embarassed and goes and sits down at a different table.  A few minutes later the woman gets up and comes over and sits by him.  She says, &quot;I'm sorry about that, but I'm a psychology student and I'm researching how people react to embarassing situations.&quot;  The guy says really loud, &quot;two hundred dollars, are you crazy?&quot;
<br />
<br />I remembered this one while I was typing in the first one.
<br />
<br />3. At a certain monestery all the friars are studying the scriptures and one friar comes to a word that's kind of blury in his Bible so he asks around and it's blurry in all the Bibles.  So all the friars go to the head friar to ask him what he thinks and he says, &quot;the oldest Bible in the monestery is down in the vault.  I'll go down there and look it up.&quot;  The other friars wait for him to come back but he's gone for a long time.  After about three hours they go down to the vault to see if he's OK and they find him and he's crying.  They ask him what's the matter and if he found out what the blury word was.  He says, &quot;I didn't find that out, but I found a different mistake.  It says, 'celebrate'.&quot;

			<div class="content">Nice Ones Ugie
<br />
<br />An Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman went into a pub for a pint of Guinness one day. After being served a fly landed in each of their pints and stuck in the creamy heads. 
<br />The Englishman pushed his pint away from him in disgust and proceeded to order another pint. 
<br />The Scotsman simply fished the offending fly out with his finger and proceeded to drink his pint as if nothing had happened. 
<br />The Irishman, eyes wide with anger grabbed the fly and held it over his pint shouting 
<br />&quot;SPIT IT OUT!!! SPIT IT OUT YOU BASTARD!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />There's an Irishman,a Scotsman and an Englishman stranded on a desert island. They are walking along the beach with no food or drink in sight, when they stumble across a golden lamp. The Englishman picks it up and gives it a rub. Suddenly, out comes a genie who says: &quot;I will grant you all one wish each&quot;. 
<br />
<br />So the Englishman says: &quot;I'm really missing my family so I would like to be back in England with the&quot;. So off he shoots back to England.
<br />
<br />The Scotsman says: &quot;yes, I'm really missing my family too so i would like to be back in Scotland with them&quot;.So off he shoots back to Scotland.
<br />
<br />The Irishman then says: &quot;well, I'm a bit lonely here all by myself so I wish the Englishman and the Scotsman were both back here with me!&quot;

			<div class="content">That last joke of yours is a Pollock joke over here.  I've never heard a good reason why we make fun of people from Poland in the United States.  What did Poland ever do to us to make them the brunt of all our jokes?  But you need to be careful who you tell jokes to.  At the end of the movie Raising Arizona there's a funny part where a guy gets pulled over and tries to shmooze the cop by telling him a Pollock joke.  Then it zooms in on the cop and shows his nametag and it says Kowalski.
