			<div class="content">FATE OF THE HISPANIA(A compilation of rumors pieced together)
<br />MOST OF YOU ALL KNOW THIS ALREADY SO DONT COMPLAIN
<br />I belive this to be the most complete Info on fate of Hispania please tell if i missed something)
<br />
<br />The Poor Poor Hispania. I drilled the poor rumor spreders on Malta and Crete to Death. THis is what I know. 
<br />
<br />The Alliance in a desperate action seeking to surivive, Built 8 Sleeper ships,
<br />The Bretonia
<br />The Liberty                         (I did not play StarLancer, I thought this was going,
<br />The Kusari                             to be  Privateer3. From what i heard they mixed
<br />The Rhienland                        the plots from the 3 games Privateer, Privateer2,
<br />The Hispania                        and Starlancer to make this stroyline up. Its about
<br />Unkown                                an alien artefact (Privateer) with an alien invasion,
<br />Unkown                                (Privateer2) and involving the Alliance and Coalition
<br />Unkown                                (Starlancer) )
<br />
<br />Suddenly The Coalitions Forces Came in a large force and attacked. the Alliance had to rush. Only Five Made it through, The Bretonia, Liberty, Kusari, Rhienland and Hispania. While Four of them sped away in Safety something was going wrong on The Hispania. It had been Sabotaged. It is not known when It was Sabotaged but suddenly they were all woken up. They had to hold a meeting. Half the crew  (later called The Corsairs)decided to leave in the shuttle craft (guessing they were maybe were larger) and left The ruined ship. Half the crew stayed on board (Known as outcasts) and kept it running till they sighted a habitable planet (at least with a breathable atmosphere(Known now as Malta). The others had finally found a planet with a breathable atmosphere too(Now Known As Crete). Now they were left to thier fate. 50% of each faction died in two years.
<br />CORSAIRS FATE
<br />After planetfall they made a home for themselves. They only had the ships rations to feed them. 2 Years later they ran out of food. The family heads had a discussion. One of the families (family names from surivived crew) was to be eaten. One was finally chosen and they Survived. 300 Years later they made contact with the rest of Sirius. They started attacking them. They attacked cargo ships which got them supplies. They would have more people if it were not for a tradition they have. In a nearby nebula the young children had to seek an artefact. If they managed to have survived it with their artefact they became part of the corsairs. Some died while trying to get their artefacts and never came back. I am not sure what happened to ones that came back without thier artefact. (probably not allowed to come back until they got it). One thing that Corsairs do with caputured enemies (truse me i would rather be dead) is they would keelhaul them, in other words putting them in a vac suit tied to a corsair ship and then the corsair ship would go through a jump hole... not pretty.
<br />
<br />THE OUTCASTS.
<br />When the crew that decided to stay on board  got to a planet, they found one with Orange grasses. The only thing that grew in the acidic soil was the grass. (i am not sure how they procured food.) They sent out foraging parties but they had never come back again. rescue parties found out why. The grass was razor sharp. they would have gotten lacerated walking through the grass and ended up bleeding to death. They found out when they got into space they could not leave for long without getting withdrawl sympotms. They had to get breathers filled with cardamine gas. They had thought that one of the sleeper ships had gotten a sabotuer aboard so as to lessen the competiton for resources. They wanted to get the entire population of sirius back. They had found a way. Cardamine. It altered the users so that they became utterly and uselessly addicted to it. Cardamine is thier way of getting back at the sirius secotr. The corsairs want to kill the sirius sector off.
