			<div class="content">my attitude is quiete simple
<br />if someone wants something then he should ask and not just take it
<br />
<br />am I egoistic now?
<br />not more than anybody else i would say
<br />I visit LR regulary for 7 years now... since 4 years im pretty much active here helping new players... helping modders... and helping the community
<br />In that time I developed many mods (some for private use, some for public use)... I also helped various modding teams when they asked for it and contributed alot of my work and time for all this... not to mention that im one of the few ppl here which did teach modding to a small group of new modders
<br />when mod creators had problems with their mods or did need help with new ideas then I did my best to help them (here and on some other FL communities)
<br />
<br />when i was LR admin also didnt just wear the admin tag and did nothing
<br />unfortunatly my try to help here caused unreasonable &quot;attacks&quot; against me and my own community several times in the past so my oppinion about several things here has changed alot 
<br />
<br />well i think ive given alot back to the community ... maybe more than anybody else
<br />
<br />if you want to create a server sided dynamic universe for mp then you need to forget what you learned in all those tutorials and tools here about system modding
<br />instead you should learn about how the net-code of FL does work and do tests with it</div>

			<div class="content">SWAT, I cant believe you actually believe what is coming out of your mouth.  Im not one to make posts and definitely not one to stick my head into dramas, but these guys are right.  
<br />
<br />One of the main reasons FL is still alive and well is because the modding community shares and does thier best do help each other out.   You state....
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade> my attitude is quiete simple
<br />if someone wants something then he should ask and not just take it<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />We'll good sir, Fadius asked, but you said...
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>and no im not willing to share anything<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Now this leaves people what option?  Taking it.  Self-defeating isnt it? 
<br />
<br />On the Freelancer Admin board, we require that you share or you go away.  To be honest it works great.  To keep an old game such as FL alive we all must work together as a community, if you dont feel the need to work with the community, dont be surprised if you are treated as an outcast.   I suggest you reaccess your current position and revise it.  Until then you will be the target of jokes and distain within the community.  The choice is yours.
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />Forsaken
<br />
<br />Not intended as a flame, just calling it how I see it...

			<h3><a href="#p422728" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">the drama is that ppl take what they want without asking which is a respectless and dishonourful act
<br />
<br />and that the modding community does share all the stuff is not true... the modders decide what they share with others and what not
<br />ill give you an example:
<br />FLshell was developed about 3 years ago, the release of a &quot;limited&quot; version was about 1 year ago
<br />in the same way tons of other stuff and serversided features are not public... nor will you see all the mod creators share their knowledge about FL
<br />
<br />just look around here... you see maybe 5-6 of the experienced modders (me included) helping others here at LR... the others dont even show up here or just read what others have developed
<br />the others are all relative new modders which are still learning to mod
<br />just go and search for the most successful mods... then get the names of the creators... and then compare which of those are really here to share what they have created
<br />
<br />that everyone does share their stuff with others is an illusion... a wish... but no reality
<br />
<br />the modders create new features for their mods and of course they want their mods being successful... more successful than the others
<br />but if they would share everything with the others then the mods would be all equal ... boring... &quot;cloned&quot;
<br />what makes some mods special are their new innovative features and those guys which use their brains to create them instead of just taking that stuff from another mod
<br />and if ppl want to understand how a feature is working then he needs to use his brain instead of &quot;copy/paste&quot;
<br />
<br />what i do.. and always did was to drop hints on the forum... i hate to say &quot;do this... do that... and next thing you need to do is...&quot; because then only 1:1 copies will be created
<br />but if you drop some hints that speed up the thinking something completly new can be the result and that is way better than a &quot;clone&quot;
<br />
<br />not to mention that i never would share my knowledge with someone which has done **** to my community... and since this is a public forum... well i just choose with who i share stuff... and for sure that is my right
<br />
<br />i dont know much about this &quot;Freelancer Admin board&quot; since very likely im not registered there because i dont see the need of that
<br />the question comes up &quot;what could you discuss there what cannot be discussed here (besided cloak)?&quot;
<br />there could be different answers to this questions such as &quot;you discuss stuff there (features) that you dont want to see public, which would mean that you also dont share your knowledge and features&quot; or it means that &quot;you dont have any development in these boards... not a single feature... nothing new about FL&quot;
<br />i mean if you would share your knowledge there and develop new stuff why cant you do this here at LR and share it with the entire community?
<br />well - no need to answer this... its pure speculation
<br />
<br />I agree with you that the community does need to work together
<br />but as long there are server admins which start trouble with other servers for no real reason.. as long there are admins which go to other servers and destroy other admins work by telling the players to leave that server so they can get alot of $ and a clansystem on another servers or spread rumours... as long mod creators are not treating other ppls work in the way it should be and as long keep going to different forums and sites to develop their stuff (instead of doing it here) this wont happen.
<br />If ill be &quot;target of jokes and distain&quot; ... for saying the truth then so may be it but you should never forget that in the past years I might have done more for other modders and the FL community than most others. And if it means to b an outcast if i want to be different from a bunch of ppl which talk like angels but act &quot;different&quot; then id love to be an outcast and hope for the community that there are more of this kind.</div>

			<div class="content">Passing from all the flaming and trolling.
<br />I have to agree with Swat here, if he would release everything his modding team has done on crossfire, everyone would use it and all mods would become the same, maybe a few new weapons here, a few new systems there, but it would be the same becuase they pretty much copied what use to be different from other mods.
<br />Same with the cool stuff like &quot;cloaking&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Economy&quot;. 
<br />Now I don't know about you guys but I couldn't give a hoot if no one did release any code to the community. Why? Becuase in the end of the day it comes down to my fun. I mod for fun and nothing else. You guys might do it for the feeling of personal fame and want to have the best. But attacking someone <b>on a forum</b> because he has made something you can't is just plain stupid. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_disapprove.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Sort of what Swat said, go out and think about it, learn about how it works and make your own great project besides wanting to copy off him for your own benifit.
<br />Can't get the people who know about it? Then go learn! Say you can't learn about it? BS, the information is out there, go get it. That's what I said about modding when I first started. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">WoD who might you be? 
<br />
<br />After reading this topic, what I do find interesting is the lack of comraderie amongst the Admins &amp; Modders in general.
<br />
<br />You all may bash Op for what he says in these forums or even his general tone towards people who say &quot;gimme gimme gimme&quot;, but I have to give him credit for sticking to his guns in what he believes is right for his mod and his rights to what he has developed.
<br />
<br />The shame of all these threads that start out as information tools, is that eventually the selfishness comes out in everyone....and yes, each one of these modders &amp; admins has the right to close the door on anyone asking for information on &quot;hey how did you do that&quot;.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately the mass of the talented modders in FL will never bring their imaginations to one point and develop what FL truly could be....ever evolving.  
<br />
<br />Now I know a few modders and admins, 3 of the 4 I know have &quot;bailed&quot; due to the political bulll**** that always finds its way here and needless to say, they are very talented.
<br />
<br />As for Op and amidst our differences ( and we have a few) he has not lost sight on the future of FL and what CF is evolving into and due to this, he has a dedicated community.
<br />
<br />I hope that someday soon, those of you who have a true and unique vision of FL modding set your differences aside and really show what this game can be.

<br />
<br />Well I meant often you seem to be speaking down on the users like &quot;I know how to do it but I will not tell you now..&quot; especially when refering to Crossfire.
<br />Apart from that my comment was related to your comment that blamed me on insulting you over the last few months. That's just wrong or may be a misunderstanding.
<br />
<br />&gt;Same with the cool stuff like &quot;cloaking&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Economy&quot;. 
<br />
<br />How would it be boring if those features get shared and implemented in many mods?
<br />Btw. real working cloak (not the exploited one) is already publicly released. Its just banned from TLR thats why it doesnt get mentioned here.
<br />
<br />
<br />So, can we get back to topic please?
<br />IMO or better AFAIK a dynamic economy changing visual(!) prices on-the-fly ONLY serverside is not possible.
<br />I thought the server could not have any impact on your local memory regarding base-good data without a clientside modification.

<br />The point here is that when people share their work we get progress as a modding community as a whole, which leads to new ideas and improvements upon old ones, thus broadening the knowledge base of the community. 
<br />
<br />I certainly understand the desire to keep something to yourself, but if everyone did that we would not be where we are today in terms of modding. Why not release an older version of whatever you made Swat? At least that way you still have the best of it, while you give them some kind of a base to make their own improvements to it.</div>

			<div class="content">If you look at it, a mod does not make a community, it enhances it.  You can have the best mod in the world and you can still have a empty server.  It depends on what you got going in the forums and how the admins and mod makers treat their players.  80% of sharing mod secrets is someone asking a question, how do you do .................?  There are a lot of mod makers who have never done anything for this community except promote their own agenda, which is unacceptable.  Yes outright mod stealing is low (I know a few mods built directly from someone else's mod, I know I've had stuff stolen from mine by two of my testers and now they are admins on the server they took it to).  We need to cut the bull here and get back to keeping FL from being extinct. This mine is better crap is outright lame and it does hurt the community as a whole.  Never once, have I said my mod is better than.............., people have different tastes and they are drawn to what they like.</div>

			<div class="content">WTF?...
<br />Wod, I know cloaking is out it always has been, but I would suggest to read my post again becuase you seem to be mad and typing words I've never used.
<br />I said, <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>&quot;I have to agree with Swat here, if he would release everything his modding team has done on crossfire, everyone would use it and all mods would become the same, maybe a few new weapons here, a few new systems there, but it would be the same becuase they pretty much copied what use to be different from other mods&quot;Same with the cool stuff like &quot;cloaking&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Economy&quot;. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />When did I say mods would get boring? They would never get boring, I said they would become the same. If someone released code to be used to the public everyone would use it and it would be common to see becuase everyone would want the &quot;best&quot; mod. You know everyone tries for that.
<br />Mod A release with &quot;dynamic economy, cloaking, 12 new systems, 500000 new weapons/ships/upgrades/ammos.&quot;
<br />Mod B release with &quot;dynamic economy, cloaking, 16 new systems, 700000 new weapons/ships/upgrades.
<br />Mod C release with &quot;dynamic economy, cloaking, 575 new systems, 1500000 new weapons/ships/upgrades/ammos.&quot;
<br />See the point? They all become the same becuase they all use the same features that would of been one of a kind which made that mod great in it's own way, but now it's common and it becomes like all other mods out there. Think about a Half life community or Battlefield Community that allowed the use of models and code from other mods, everyone would take it and use it and there would not be any &quot;one of a kind mod&quot;. Everything would be the <i>same</i>.
<br />Please rethink your post.
