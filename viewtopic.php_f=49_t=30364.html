			<div class="content">Welcome To the town of Tawsburg
<br />
<br />It is set in the old west about 2 hours ride southwest of Dodge in the year 1844
<br />
<br />As towns go, it wasn&#8217;t all that big, but the folks here about think of themselves as family. And as families go, they have a time looking out for each other, even the distant cousins.
<br />
<br />     The local sheriff is a wise man by the name of Bargib. He has several deputies under him that he trusts so much, he can do an occasional ride through town with nary a worry about the safety of the folks. 
<br />
<br />This town is lucky enough to have two full time doctors to help out with what ever ales the people. Dr. Esquilax and Dr. Tawakalna of whom the town is named. There are several citizens of the town known to help out in the medicinal arts when needed too. 
<br />
<br />     The one room school house has just got a new school marm by the name of sycho-warrior. Some of the folks hide a giggle when she rides by on her buggy, thinking she will have her hands full with the children. The previous marm left town exasperated at the antics of some of the folks teaching the crazy notion that people can fly. &#8220;Everyone knows&#8221;, she said, &#8220;only birds can fly&#8221;. With a flurry of her petticoat, she whipped the rains of the horse and was off. 
<br />
<br />     The Tawsburg daily news has an editor by the name of Indy. He always keeps the folks informed and up to date on the current events in the county. He even had a strange notion of what he called an editorial page, where , he said, &#8220;Folks can let others know their opinion of things&#8221;.  The men of the town thought that was just plumb silly, they like to do that in the local Bar called The Forum. So many a discussion goes on there till late in the night. 
<br />
<br />     There are a few odd folk. Inventors I believe they call themselves. They do have some strange notions. One by the name of pSYCHO who goes on and on about redesigning the horse shoe. Trying to make the horse run faster. One of them  has been plowing up a section of town wanting, as he put it, to make a new place in the town. His name is Chips, one of the new deputies. 
<br />
<br />     The town is usually quiet on most days, other than the occasional gun fire coming from the smiths shop. You hear as you walk down the streets, the metal on metal sound from the blacksmith, see the &#8220;Open&#8221; sign on the mercantile called &#8220;The Download&#8221;. It is said you can get almost anything in there, including directions on how to use the items.
<br />
<br />    The local bakery has all kinds of goods. The baker, one Finalday, is known for his talk of food. The wives, including Dr. Tawakalna's mrs. , come by every morning for loaves of bread and then stop over at The Download to get some butter and preserves. Honey is available in the spring time too
<br />
<br />     A lot of the town rides out to work the ranches nearby. The school fills up with the younger folk and a few who want the &#8220;Higher&#8221; education, but can&#8217;t afford to move back east to get it. Education is a bit basic, but, the students do learn what it takes to get by with life in the town. 
<br />
<br />    pSYCHO came by The Download today to say his updated, for the life of me I have no idea what that means, horse shoe and he said he&#8217;s working on a holster to make drawing a gun faster too.  Bakedpotato, who ran The Download, said he would put an announcement up that it was available. PSYCHO said to put on it that supersnipa had helped on the design too. 
<br />
<br />     pSYCHO stopped by to see Arania the gunsmith with his new holster to see if he had one to fit it so he could fine tune the holster. Arania pulled out one of the new colts that he bought a week ago from the maker, colonel Colt. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you try this one out&#8221; he said., &#8220;but I need it back for the display by the end of the week.&#8221; When the agreement was reached, pSYCHO headed by to see supersnipa so they could work on the speed of the draw.
<br />
<br />Chapter 2
<br />
<br />    Out on the ranch of the Wolf_Demon family, young wolfy was seen heading over to the neighboring ranch whose son was Eh_Steve. Together they could Get into mischief. They like to go to the dry riverbed and get some chunks of the dry gray clay and sneak back into town to write on the sides of the shops. A couple of the folks said &#8220;we got to do something about this, this, spam&#8221;. Where he got that word I will never know. Both of the boys dreamed of being cattle rustlers of sorts. All the daring and thrills made them even want to be...bandits, if you can believe it. 
<br />
<br />     The Forum usually got busy around six o&#8217;clock in the evening. The chatter could be heard half way up the street. One person always had the weather on his mind, his name was freighter fighter. It became a regular topic at least once a week. There was the regular complaint of broken pencils that half the town would keep Bakedpotato&#8217;s stock down. Something about the record keeping they did. They all wanted the latest style too. Some would compare the designs they whittled in them. Strange pictures on some. There were a few too that like to talk about just anything to keep from having to go home. Chips and Stinger often pulled the job of keeping an eye on The Forum so none got out of hand. The other deputies would stop by from time to time to join a conversation or to just look around.
