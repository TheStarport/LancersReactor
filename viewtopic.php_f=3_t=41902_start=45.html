			<div class="content">I think i should really update that list. We've added quite a few more things since then. (too many to name)
<br />
<br />And i think there will be enough ships. And even if i wanted more ships, i cant just wip some up, as this is a orthentic Firefly mod. with only those ship that you see in the Series/Movie.
<br />
<br />And as for the weapons. we'll what i should have said is weapon types.
<br />
<br />there will be several different calibre of the &quot;Flak cannons&quot;, &quot;Machine Guns&quot;, &quot;Missiles&quot; &amp; maybe &quot;Plasma&quot; (for the different ship classes&quot; And they wont have the basic default look that all the FL weps do. They will be custom weapon meshes.
<br />
<br />The reason that nothing has been released pubicly yet, is that this is a monumental undertaking on our part. And we only have a very small team working on the mod, that all has other comitments to attend too. Also we dont want to make the mistake of releaseing a mod too soon. full of bugs and glitches, and unfinished content that would turn people off because of the incomplete nauture of it.
<br />
<br />I for one think this will make an exelent mod... (if we can deliver what we hope for) The problem is we have so many experimental ideas and concepts, we are bound to run into a few brick walls every now and then.

			<div class="content">best idea for a mod ever! ignore what that one person said about only one system being boring. I think it makes it great. it stays true to firefly and thats whats going to make it great. I am useless at modding but I can give moral support and I can say I will be one of the first to play this as soon as it's ready! good luck! and I hope to see the release of this mod in the near future!

			<div class="content">Hey all, 
<br />
<br />I have some bad news, Our System Engineer from since the start of the mod has left unexpectantly and now we are left without a system Creator to work on our system.
<br />This is a major set back for us, as the previous System Engineer took all the work he was doing for us with him. So we're back to square one. I come to you today looking for help. We need someone to take up his place, and work on creating out FF system. 
<br />Without it, the MOD is Doomed.
<br />
<br />Its Only One system that needs to be created, but its a lot different that your average FL system. For one it&#8217;s got to be ALOT Bigger.
<br />
<br />Experience with FL system creation is a must. As this system will require some pretty serious coding. If you think you can help, or know anyone that could. Please send me and Email.

			<div class="content">Is there still anything active being developed on the mod? Because I really think Firefly and Freelancer have a LOT of parallels storyline-wise.
<br />
<br />Let's go about it a little differently, set it post-movie and somewhat similar to the Babylon 5 and X Universe style, which would be a little easier to make (not one big system<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />2578. In the aftermath of the war with the Reavers, Alliance forces dwindled and more worlds were under the control of the Independents. Some Alliance colonies fanned out, and the situation eventually stabilized in 2681 with the settlement of a new delegation on the core worlds. Alliance put less effort in military strength, tensisons dropped, Reaver population is not much of a threat.
<br />
<br />2583. On a survey expedition near the recently cleared Miranda planet, an Alliance science vessel discovered energy readings which were similar to a ship's gravity emissions. The only difference was that these emissions were a lot bigger, and the variations indicated some form of space manipulation technology.
<br />Upon closer inspection, it turned out that it was a form of jump gate technology, which became active again after the huge battle on Miranda and the large energy discharges involved. The gate was towed to Alliance space for further investigation.
<br />
<br />2584. Browncoat intelligence found out about the recently discovered jump gate and a small group of undercover intel people (mostly freelancers) went to the Alliance science facility. They discovered the gate was active and being used by Alliance troops, and a large political struggle started the Second Unification War.
<br />
<br />2602. Many battles have been fought, lives have been lost. Although the outcome of UW2 was never what anyone expected, no one considered themselves a victor. Londinium was in ruins, and many Browncoats fled through the gate to the system on the other side. There, a network of multiple interconnected gates was disovered and a power struggle began for the adjoining systems.
<br />
<br />That was 25 years ago now. People have spread over the systems, and the population distribution reminded us of decades back, with most Browncoats struggling for survival on the outer rim, while most Alliance citizens stayed in the core worlds. Not much has changed on the technological front, as most tech was destroyed during the war and all factions needed to make ends meet.
<br />
<br />Okay, that was a short storyline to make up an excuse for using gates in a Firefly mod. You can of course also use jump holes, who says they aren't a natural phenomenon in the 'verse too?
<br />
<br />Setting it post-movie means the factions are more balanced, and making uo a war in between means you can fiddle around a bit with ships and new station/weapon designs. But the original mindset should remain. As do the Reavers, I'm not sure how those guys are supposed to procreate but somehow they did as well, so they're a definite faction (could use the Nomad systems for this)
<br />
<br />In the Alliance and Browncoat main factions, you can create sub facitons like security force, mercenaries, bounty hunters, traders and the like just like in the Freelancer universe. I'd be happy to design a few maps but don't count on a lot, I'm pretty good at writing stories, scripting and artwork.
<br />
<br />Is it by any chance possible to replace the orignal intro sequence by something of our own?
<br />
<br />Edit: The idea of using only one system also sounds appealing. But... the reason why Freelancer used multiple systems connected through gates in the first place was because loading times and system stress would be enormous otherwise. Using gates breaks the whole universe up into managable chunks.
