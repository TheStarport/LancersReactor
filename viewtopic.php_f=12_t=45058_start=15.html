			<div class="content">it looks absolutely delightful! I gasped a bit at the price, but then we worked it out that if we took enough people, it really wouldn't be that expensive. Very nice. Mrs Taw was drooling over it. It's a little too well-appointed for my spartan tastes, but suits the wife right down to the ground; she likes her creature comforts. The location is wonderful, and not far off the SS76 iirc? You can fly from Liverpool-Ancona on Ryanair I think, for about 45 tawakalni dinar.

			<div class="content">I doubt we're causing global warming.  But we're certainly not helping the situation any, with all of our pollution and crap that's in the air.  I've always believed that global warming  is a natural process after an ice age, which I think we're still coming out of.  But the world is warming up too fast.  As a result, certain weather patterns have changed.  Look at last year with all those powerful hurricanes that we've had.  If that's not evidence enough, I don't know what is.  Taw:  We've had tornadoes here in Utah, which is very unusual.  The most famous one is the one that damaged the Delta Center back in 1996.  We had t-shirts made up because of that, which I thought was funny.</div>

<br />
<br />and yes, I have to tell you, we <i>are  </i> causing global warming. Not that it can't and doesn't happen naturally, because the Earth wobbles on it's axis, the Sun can vary it's output, and other factors such as volcanoes chucking much up into the atmosphere. But, if you look at the most reliable evidence for global weather conditions, ice cores, they clearly show that going back several hundred thousand years, these natural variations have been up and down within a fairly restricted range. A range that has been of course sufficient to cause several ice ages and warm periods, showing that it doesn't take much change in global temperatures to drastically alter global weather and environment. What's the common factor between these shifts, the evidence that links them all? the quantity of carbons in the atmosphere. Admitting that there are indeed natural explanations for increased carbon levels in the atmosphere, the ice record shows that there has (wait for it) NEVER been as high a concentration of carbons in the atmosphere as there is now (it's staggeringly vaster than at any time in the past as far as we can tell) and this trend can be clearly traced back about 250 years to, surprise surprise, the same time as the beginning of mass industrialisation and the concomitant burning of fossil fuels. Mmmm, do ya think there might a connection there?
<br />
<br />So yes, there is indeed natural warming and cooling and we are in a warming phase, and have been since the mid 17th C since the so-called &quot;mini ice-age&quot; - but mass industrialisation and it's associated pollution has dramatically increased this trend not just a bit, but a lot, by several orders of magnitude. 
<br />
<br />Thing is, no-one wants to see it or do anything about it. Too many vested interests and we like things the way they are thank you and don't want to give up our cars and energy inefficient homes and everything else that's a part of modern life, and the people in the developing world want what we've got so they don't want to be held back either. So basically we're scr*wed, or more accurately, you lot are, because by the time the worst of it comes, I'll be long dead. I don't want to be around in 2050, because it will be quite a lot worse then, this is just the start. By 2100 unless really drastic action is taken, the world will be pretty dreadful to live in. I'm glad I won't be around to see it. I pity my kids though.
<br />
<br />The problem with adopting the attitude of &quot;it's a natural phenomenon&quot; is that it absolves us of blame. We can say it's sunspots or some other convenient pseudo-scientific excuse to do nothing, certainly not anything that would have any sort of drastic effect on our lifestyles, because, and this is the way people are, I'm afraid to say, if it's not effecting us directly, it's someone else's problem or not even a problem at all. I'm sure people feel very sad about the polar bears, but I fear that until New York is under 500 feet of water or whatever, being sad about the polar bears is about all the reaction there's going to be. For pity's sake, New Orleans gets destroyed by a monster hurricane the like of which has rarely been seen before and there's still people who say &quot;it's all part of a natural cycle&quot; - I'm quite sure they wouldn't be saying that if it was <i>their </i> house that had been swept away, <i>their </i> family that had been decimated, <i>their </i>life destroyed. As long as it happens to &quot;someone else&quot; then it just isn't a problem and it's easy to sit on your backside doing nothing except thinking up excuses to carry on doing nothing. Selfish complacnecy is what I call it, exactly the same sort of mean-spirited narrow-minded self-indulgence that we see every time there's a natural disaster, the sort of people who blame Pakistanis for living in earthquake zones, or Bangladeshis for living on a flood plain, or Ethiopians for living in a  drought zone. Saying it's all just part of a natural cycle is merely another excuse for doing sweet b*gger all and for big business to keep all those lovely profits. Tragic but true. 
<br />
<br />I heard a funny story on the radio today; aliens invade the Earth and when asked why, they say they're a dying race and they've expoited the natural resources of their own planet, destroyed it's environment, and need to colonise a new world to survive. When they realise that humans have knackered up this planet, they say &quot;er no we'll leave it, thanks all the same,&quot; pack up their alien armies and b*gger off to find a better planet to take over....

			<div class="content">@Taw: You certainly wont get any argument from me. Every single day this month, the temperature around where i live has easily peaked in the 25-30 C range (77 - 86 Farenheit, for those that use it). And its only just starting summer (I feel particularly sorry for those down in Melbourne and southern New South Wales. Apparently they are getting peaks of 37 C (98.6 F)).
<br />
<br />Anyone who thinks there's no such thing as global warming? why don't you come down and live with me for a few months. I think the extreme temperature and absolutely absurd humidity will do something to dissuade you!
<br />
<br />Although, i must happen to agree with the sentiments about corporations doing bugger all. Its immediately clear they care about nothing other than sweet sweet profit. Which is probably the problem nowadays: No-one cares about the future, they only care about three things - Themselves, the immediate present, and getting gobloads of money</div>

			<div class="content">I have got a huge bruise on the shin from where Mrs Taw kicked me for looking at your mum's picture for too long....
<br />
<br />.. I'm looking at the availability and rates and thinking of September, not just because it's cheaper but because long experience has taught me that Central Italy is just too hot at the height of summer. The Marche is a lot cooler due to it's elevated position and coastal breezes off the Adriatic, but I want to go inland this time and work my way down the Tiber Valley - Mrs Taw has never been to Perugia, Orvietio, Spoleto or Lake Trasimene, and the kids don't beleive that there really is such a place as Narnia. Plus Mrs Taw wants to go shopping in Rome and I conveniently managed to avoid that last time... don't think I'll get away with it twice in a row. btw am I right in thinking that while trains to Rome and Florence pass nearby, the Express that terminate at Ancona only stop at Jesi and Fabriano? 
<br />
<br />Incidentally, have you ever been to Italia in Miniattura just outside Rimini? it's ace!
