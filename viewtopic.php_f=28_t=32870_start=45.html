			<div class="content">BLACK EAGLE
<br />                   Thank you yet once again for your quick response.Please dont worry about any mistakes or so called bugs,I think the appearance of 'Nomad Outpost'ships(Unioners) maybe due to fact that i may have been close to the Jumphole to Omega 41? Is that in the same system as Freeport 6 ?
<br />                   Azar &amp; Powerdoll, this question is too you, Do you find it difficult to complete the story mission? I only have the Monkies Mod active and no others and started the game from scratch,and i dont have any problems at all . Its like the new stuff was allready there! I know the enemies are way ' hyped up' in this mod ( especially when you have to save' Beta 4' and when you, King and Juni  have to destroy the Cloaking Detection space satellite for 'Orillion' then meet Walker at the jumpgate to the Alaska system). 
<br />                   Get hold of a Light-Fighter,(cause anything else is just too big of a target)Slap two 'Advance Stun-pulse'cannons on it ,a 'Luger type A' and a rapid refire-rate laser cannon, and stay on their tail so they cant get a chance to open fire on you( some advanced straffing and evasive manuevering techniques also help, heh heh ) cause these are the parts of the mod that see if you are good enough to even play this mod( Well thats only my opinion of course )
<br />               I dont know if this helps but i always play in 'Cockpit' view which allows me to really get up close and almost see inside their 'cock-pit' ( just before i turn it into space debri heh heh) cause playing in cockpit view makes your target 'bigger' ,which makes it easier to anticipate the enemy crafts point of trajectory( dont worry about your targeting system, just watch the ship, even when launching missiles, and you'll hardly EVER miss!)
<br />                BLACK EAGLE , you certainly know what your doing as far as i am concerned. I Have never heard of this Xerx mod.Your mod is truelly awesome because it is integrated into the storyline so well !! I like it so much i'm even thinking of writing some fan fiction , related to the 'Monkies' mod heh heh (is that ok ?)Thanking you.

			<div class="content">Vader I did not find the storyline particulariy difficault! Afterwords I though was a lot harder. I have done the storyline in various mods at least 15 times. What I try to do now is keep the starting ship as long as I can. Of course I get the best weapons that i can. This I beleave will make me a better pilot.So far it's been working.I often take the order's ship the Anubis into Omicron systems as far as I can.I usually end up buying an Eagle at this point to finish the game.I look foward to your fan-flic....

			<div class="content">Hi Black Eagle, I've just finished the story line with your mode.
<br />
<br />As to the game-bug reported in my last post, I did creat a new game with your mode activated only, but I edited the save file and change the outlook of trent(Outcast's uniform is cool, but I like Order's better.) If no one else encounter such bug in new moded game, then the bug may be caused by my editing. I'll get over it.
<br />
<br />However, Some other features of this mod still need to improve. First of all, compared with the original game, your world is too much tougher. In freelance part, I can hardly kill anyone before I get Anubis MK2. My ship always gets out of power before I make the final hit. And when the power returns, the enemy has also recovered both in hull and sheild. I think the regeneration of sheild is ok, but the recovery of hull is too fast and thus makes the battle too long and boring. After all, NPC's capability of recovery should not be made equal to player's because one player has to face several NPCs. If you want to do so, you should also enhance the damage of missles to give player a chance to kill enemy by one shot before it recover.
<br />
<br />Secondly, nomad is claimed to be enemy of all other forces in your world, but when I fight against nomad, my relationship with others remains the same except for the force that hire me, that's not logical.
<br />
<br />More over, the order/monkey shield, although very strong, makes ship shake badly when bumping into anything in cruise flight. Maybe this is an illusion, but ADV Champion HF shield seems smoother, the hexagons appear on attacking is also very cool. I made quite a hard dicision to change it. It will be great if the most strong shield has the same performance as ADV Champion HF.
<br />
<br />There are still some small problems with the monkey and robert planets. For example, the roberts in bar should not sound like human. There ARE some roberts in some bars of original game's and their voice is just like machine. More over, the mission consigners of monkey and robert forces are always human, which is not realistic.
<br /> 
<br />well, if I sound like a complainer, please forgive me. All I want to see is a better monkey1.2 . I've express my praise to the mod so I dont repeat that. If I didn't love this mod, I would not take the pain to write so much.
<br />
<br />On more advice, if allowed. Like I said before, it will be outstanding from other mode to reveal the locked feature of original game. Besides making some secpial ship pilotable, you can also make use of the sepcial system locked after finishing the story (like Alaska) to build you own base and trade line. Compared with creating strange systems, this will make your mod seem more official.</div>

<br />                   Sorry to keep posting punky stuff,but one thing i thought i might mention is when in dock in 'Omicron-Theta' ,the ' physical label ' in the Nav-Map for the 'Omicron-Alpha ' Jumphole was missing , even when you zoom in(i didn't check it when in space though).I dont know if this is a problem but it was when i had to get back to the colonies in order to raise some serious credits.(one rumour said not to take on the N1-Valkyrie with anything less than the Anubis Mk-II. They were absolutely right !!), i'm after the Class 10 Light fighter and the 'Order/Monkey ' developed energy shield. This gives the incentive to go into the colonies space and freelance or whatever until there is enough credits to upgrade to ' Order/Monkey/Robot  &amp; even Nomad N1's standard of Heavy-Assault Fighter class ship.
<br />               Azar,Powerdoll please forgive my Punkness, i'm just a freak for freelancer heh heh.I sometimes forget its only a Space flight sim.(trade,capture,Espionage,Doulble cross,Salvage,Assault Extra-Terrestrial's,Assault Heavy-Lifters) Shoot-em -up .
<br />
<br />
<br />            Aborting mission , until i get that stuff, Vader{MERCS}

<br />                    This is Vader,sorry but my ' Corsair ' Tizona-del-cid Class 9 Pulse cannon has no Laser bolts, Energy bolts, Radiation Energy beams or projectile tracers coming out of it when i fire but it definately is shooting something cause it fulfills its performance specifications. (i got it from either the Monkies or Robots planet, not sure,so many Nomad Capital-ship encounters ago) Is this normal ? cause i have never bought this piece of weaponry before.

			<div class="content">Hey, Vader{MERCS}. Never mind, we like your talkativeness, you make the thread lively<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I noticed the problem about physical label of 'Omicron-Theta' and Tizona-del-cid, too. The label is missing but you can still find the jump hole cos the red nebula represents jumphole is visible on Nav Map. It stands above the planet Vespus.
<br />
<br />The bug of Tizona-del-cid, if can be called so, belongs to the original game. I think the invisible bolts make a weapon stronger in PK cos one can hardly avoid the bolts if cannt see them. Since Black Eagle has mentioned some experimental shipss in his next version, I think maybe some of this ships can make all of their beam invisible, or just make themselves invisible like the two Rheiland Fighters helped Trent in story.
<br />
<br />B.T.W. do you know how to get well with nomad? I fighted nomad in order to buy equipments from Robert and Monkey. But I also found some great equipment from nomad force. Is there some bribe to  make nomad green so I can buy their fantastic equipments? Some of their lauchers need no ammo, I love it badly.</div>

<br />                    Thankyou for the response to my questions.I eventually found my way back to the colonies( Barelly in one piece!heh heh) With the ' Tizona del cid ' , thanx for clearing that up for me , its still a wicked weapon though i noticed there is yet an even more Powerful pulse cannon available from those crafty yet resourceful Little Space Monkies( From failed 20th Century Space Expeditions in their current  24th Century form heh heh)Have you scored that Light-Fighter available in the unknowns? what is its handling , speed ? (Max Drive and Cruise engine speed) and power generator  like? what about the Troth freighter ? Are those two extra cockpits i see ? and are those filled with two ' Co-Pilots ' ?(A gunner/targeting technician and a deep Quandrant navigator/Engineer? heh heh) I also want those regenerating Nomad C.D.,M.D. and T.Launchers,they Look like they pack one serious punch judging by the spec. board.Cheers.

			<div class="content">Sorry for this triple posting!!! I got some strange warnings, and then my internet connection was cut. Can't immagine what happened, sorry again!
<br />Okay, deleted the two copies!
<br />
<br />
<br />Hi again!
<br />
<br />Azar: I'm affraid, but in Singleplayer, levels above level 40 are not possible. I already increased the requirements for each level. Besides I think that you can also keep playing the game, if you are on level 40. In my opinion you do not really need higher levels. Of course you cannot buy any new items, but it should dtill be funny to fight against multiple Nomads or Monkeys.
<br />
<br />Vader: I would really like to see a Fan-fiction of you about my mod! Thanks for this.
<br />The missing name for the Omicron Alpha Jumphole is a bug in the original game. I play with the Unofficial SP Patch 1.4, which fixes this bug, but I will add the fix in the next version of my mod.
<br />
<br />Powerdoll: Many thanks for your post. It really helps to improve my mod.
<br />But at first to your bug. I was not able to look into this until now. This evening I will try to find any mistakes, but it could also be the edited savegame.
<br />
<br />The idea to make the missiles stronger is good. But the thing with the Nanobots I'm not sure about. There are some new weapons (the Robot Pulse weapons), which destroy shields with two or three shots. Then you only need to destroy the hull. Of course your enemies are using Shield batteries and Nanobots, but if they won't do this it would be to easy. So, I can maybe give them less Nanobots, or make the Nanobots repair less hull damage. I will think about how to include this in the next version.
<br />
<br />To the Nomads: At first I made all factions loving you if you fight the Nomads, but this was like cheating, because you only needed to fight the Nomads and everyone else loves you. I think this is not really what you want.
<br />And I can also explain, why the other factions do not love you for this. As it is said in some News on the new bases (You should read the news and the rumors in my mod. It may be interesting or even funny) all information about the Nomads was confiscated, and everyone forgot them, except the Order, the Monkeys and the Robots. And of course the Corsairs and the Outcasts, because they got Nomads in their home systems. So, as all other factions forgot about them (or at least are not knowing really much about them), they do not care if you fight the Nomads. The Outcasts and the Corsairs do also not really hate the Nomads. For this read the description of thr Nebula in Omicron Alpha where the Nomads fly around. The Outcasts believe that the Nomads are something like gods (I'm not really sure what is standing there now. Please read it yourself). So the only ones that love you for fighting the Nomads are the Order, the Monkeys and the Robots.
<br />
<br />I will look into the shield thing. It's not so hard to make all the new shields like the Adv. Champion HF shield.
<br />
<br />Until now I didn't found any robot voices for people in bars, but I think I also remember some robots (at least bartenders) in bars. I will try to give the Robots these voices. If this is not possible, I got this explanation. The Robots on Planet Gammu, are such highly developed and intelligent beings, that they got human voices. I personally like this idea (There are also films with robots, which got human voices, because they are so highly developed. For example: I, Robot). What do you think about it?
<br />I'm affraid, but there are definitely no robot mission consigners. I will see, if it is possible to make new pictures for the Robots and the Monkeys, but i think that this is impossible, sorry!
<br />
<br />I already got an idea of implementing some of the locked systems like Alaska. You will hopefully see these systems in the next version.
<br />
<br />As I mentioned above: The missing name for the Omicron Alpha Jumphole is a bug in the original game. I play with the Unofficial SP Patch 1.4, which fixes this bug, but I will add the fix in the next version of my mod.
<br />
<br />There are no bribes for the Nomads, because this would be unrealistic (hacking alien computers??? <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />The only way to get well with the Nomads is to fight the Monkeys, the Robots and the Order (the last is the easiest, but the Monkeys and the Robots will hate you for that, heh, heh <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />That's it for now. Tomorrow I will start again with modding, as I was not able to mod the last week.

			<div class="content">Hey, Black Eagle. Your explaination on &quot;the relationship between nomad and others&quot; and &quot;the human voice of robert&quot; is quite reasonable, I like your setting in these two aspects.
<br />
<br />As to the hull recovery of NPC, I still suggest you at least reduce its speed cos it makes the game too tough. When a player spends several hours on boring trading between systems in order to afford a level 10 ship, he is expecting the feeling to be peerless. But the fact is, even with your best ship and weapons, I still have to take 2 minutes before I get down one Vakellir N1. In the original game when I drive a Titan with nomad guns, I can can blow up most ships in one round. (a round means rush to an enemy and shoot from the edge of fire range until your ship touch the hull of that enemy's) I can hardly find such exciting feeling in your mod, I'm afraid.
<br />
<br />I have a question about the rules of your mod, not problem. Do I have the chance to get nomad's topedo launcher by blowing up their ships? I got one nomad cruise disputor and one nomad mine in two missions, but no more. All I got in the following fights is nomad guns. Can I get more cruise disputor if I keep fighting nomad? Anubis MK2 has three hardpoit of CD/T you know.
<br /> 
<br />No new advices this time. I know if I keep requiring improvements of this or that all the time I will never get the next vresion<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> So just do what's in your mind and we will always support you! Should I shout  &quot;long live the black eagle&quot; like the blood dragon?<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Greeting, Black Eagle.
<br />
<br />I must apologize for keeping opposing your setting of hull recovery. For I just found out why I can not take down enemies quickly - I forgot to use topedos! Topedos are slow and expensive in original game, so I never use them. However, when my level 10 guns made absolutely no harm to order's Anubis MK2 (that's the way you told me to get well with nomad), I suddenly remebered there were two hardpoints still remain unused in my ship, so I put two sunslayer on and... now I find back the feeling of being peerless! Topedos are not so expensive since I can afford Anubis MK2 now, and the three hardpoints of CD/T has removed confliction between CD and T, your setting has made this original useless weapon helpful now. That's considering, I was stupid I should have found it before. 
<br />
<br />So please donnt change this setting.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi!
<br />
<br />Powerdoll: Thanks for your two posts!
<br />
<br />I'm sorry, but the Nomad Torpedolauncher is not dropped by the NPCs. You can only buy it. This is because the torpedolauncher of the NPCs is a better one. It's torpedoes are faster and more agile, to make the Nomad Valkyries even deadlier!!!
<br />All the other weapons of the Nomads, the Monkeys, The Robots and the Order should be dropped by the NPCs (I hope I didn't forget any of the weapons).
<br />
<br />I'm still thinking about the hull recovery thing, even if you like it now. But I'm not sure now.
<br />
<br />Many thanks again! It's good to hear that you like my mod!
<br />
<br />(And of course, sorry that I always use the same phrases, but I'm from Germany and not so good in English. If you find a big mistake in one of the new texts in my mod, please correct me! Thanks)
<br />
<br />Vader: Yes the Toth freighter has got the two additional pilots!
<br />
<br />To your fan fiction: I think you should send it to lancersreactor. There is a new fan fiction section on the site. If you submit your story post it here and I will download it. I would really like to read a story, taking place in the universe of my mod!!
<br />Thanks
<br />
<br />To the mod: Today I tweaked the Robot system. It now has all bases with NPCs and also some encounters. I only need to add some more encounters and patrol paths. Then the first system is done. So please be patient. Until the release of the next version I have many things to do. I suggest that I will release the next version in about three months, but maybe it will take a bit longer!
<br />I hope you can wait till then!</div>

I also cannot wait to see your next mod.One question, did you release a Star wars mod ?

			<div class="content">Hi Vader!
<br />
<br />No, I'm affraid but I never worked on a Starwars mod. I like the Starwars universe, but I think that there should be an own game for this and not only mods. There are of course great Starwars mods for Freelancer, but I think that Freelancer and the game engine are not perfect for Starwars mods (one example: It's not possible to add the light speed from Starwars).
<br />So I hope that there will be a good Starwars space simulation in the next years!
<br />
<br />I'm working on the mod, but as I said it will take some time!
<br />
<br />See you, Black Eagle</div>
