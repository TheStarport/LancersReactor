			<div class="content">weren't you reading <i>Neuromancer  </i> a while back, Rec?
<br />
<br /><i>Slaughterhouse V  </i> - great choice! ever read <i>Sirens of Titan?  </i>
<br />
<br />I think it's great that so many people have<i>1984  </i> on their lists. especially in the current climate of fear and paranoia, maybe (just maybe) it will give enough people pause for thought about what is happening around us and to us.
<br />
<br />Wouter - <i>Da Vinci Code </i> - <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> - I read it a while back, albeit reluctantly at first. I enjoyed it, as a thriller anyway, it was good fun, quite well done, couldnt put it down in fact; but as a revelation of occult history, well let's just say that i laughed quite a lot and at times it annoyed me. My daughter loved it and questioned me at length about the *revelations* of secret iconography hoping that I'd tell her it was true and that she'd discovered some mystic secret (rememeber I have an MA in Renaissance Art and I specialised in iconography and Neo-Platonism) and she was most upset to find that Mr Brown's theories were to put it mildly bunk. a Woman in the Last Supper indeed! anyone who's remotely studied Renaissance Art knows that major part of the Rinascimento ethos was to portray the classical ideal, so young men were shown as soft-featured idealised slightly effeminate youths with pale-skins and flowing locks. i can point out dozens of paintings that do exactly the same; angels are depicted like this even though they are male, even Jesus is portrayed in that way, especially by Piero della Francesca, Ghirlandaio, Verrochio and Domenico Veneziano, all of whom were well known to LdV, he studied their work thoroughly and indeed was a pupil in Verrochio's school.
<br />
<br />great work of fiction, sadly not born out by reality. at least not how he portrays it. Opus Dei and the like exist, and im well aware that the Vatican gets involved in all sorts of skullduggery, theyve got a lot of dirty laundry to be sure. and there are occult and mystic messages and hidden knowledge in Renaissance paintings, but not what Senor Brown says.

			<div class="content">Yes I know that big pieces of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code has to be taken with a grain of salt (or a whole bucket <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), but nonetheless it was quite enjoyable in the matter of suspense and storytelling. And you gotta hand it to the guy that it's quite impressive that his book is one of the best selling books in history. I've also read his book Angels &amp; Demons, which was a good book as well. And I read his Digital Fortress, but that was quite a let down considering his other work. It wasn't really bad, but nothing extraordinary either.
<br />
<br />And now Ron Howard is making a movie of The Da Vinci Code, due to be released in theaters in May 2006. More info on <a href='http://www.thedavincicodemovie.com' Target=_Blank> <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thedavincicodemovie.com">www.thedavincicodemovie.com</a><!-- w --></a>
<br />
<br />I'm not sure about this one, most adaptions of great books turn out to be utterly bad and cheesy. But, occasionally there are some good ones. I'm probably going to see it, just to ease my curiosity <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">@ taw: didn't know about your expertise in Renaissance art - if you're interested in those fascinating eras between the Middle Age and Renaissance and its explosion of new thoughts (about human society, 3D-perspective, division of labour, direct &quot;communication&quot; with Supreme Power - just naming a few) you should read Umberto Eco's &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; or &quot;Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Of course you have probably already read them <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> your list is impressive - but I think, one of Eco's books belongs to a list of the 'three best of all times'.
<br />
<br />Same for a novel by Ursula LeGuin, &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, unique Scifi-writer with NEW ideas, not the notorious technology-based war-novels with I-am-the-greatest-heros. 
<br />
<br />Last but not least: Raymond Queneau &quot;Zazie dans le m&#233;tro&quot; (you got it!), a wonderful piece of literature full of funny puns. Queneau - a french Maths and Physics professor was deeply interested in the mathematical part of writing. Believe it or not, but it is incredibly funny. In &quot;Exercices de style&quot; he presented 100 variations of the same odd story - and it is still hilarious.
<br />
<br />Oh, I forgot my personal favourites Stanislav Lem and Samuel Beckett - it's really difficult to name only three ...</div>

			<div class="content">read everything he's written, zazie, and met the man himself at a seminar in Bologna, quite a few years ago now. still trying to work my way through <i>Kant and the Platypus </i> though!
<br />
<br />my own area of specialisation and the one I did my MA thesis on is Neo-Platonic symbolism in architectural treatise' of the 15th and 16th Centuries, mainy concentrating on Alberti and Filarete. was a bit of a chore, esp the paleography part. more for an M.Phil or even a Ph.D really as i got stuck in a bit too deep, MAs are only really about methodology after all. still all that ideal city stuff really got to me, and the legacy of people like Alberti and Palladio are still with us today - peopel like le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe and indeed much of the Modern Movement theory was derived from them (don't ask me to prove it, i dont think TLR's server could handle it! but if you ever go to Lyons, visit what was built of Garnier's <i>Cit&#233; Industrielle </i> - its a revelation.
<br />
<br />i take it that as far as film adaptations of <i>Solaris </i> are concerned its the Andre Tsarkovsky version you hold with and not the erm George Clooney thing a few years ago. best quietly forgotten that. 
<br />
<br />sorry to say im not a fan of Ursula K le Guin. loved her work when i was a teenager but went right off it later. however, recently i picked up <i>City of Illusions </i> and loved it, apart from the poor ending.</div>

			<div class="content">I heartily recommend <i>The Batlle of Umboto Gorge </i> by Lord Jingo Carruthers, First Earl of Gordons-on-the-rocks. it describes the stunning victory of the 21st Foot and Mouth over the fierce Pygmies of Umboto Gorge, who viciously ambushed the Redcoats with devilishly sharp guava halves and mangoes, forcing the outnumbered Tommies to return fire with their only Maxim gun.
<br />
<br />take no head of the revisionist version circulated by modern detractors of this stunning period of history, suggesting it was actually a Massacre at Umboto Gorge, such as Chief Muthelezi who is only trying to get his ancestral cattle back so he can lord it over his neighbours on the veldt. 
<br />
<br />it was a close-run thing - they were very sharp guava halves.</div>
