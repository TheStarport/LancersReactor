			<div class="content">In the thread covering T-Hawk's <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=22689&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Startracker+Campaign&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;cat_title=Freelancer&amp;M=True' Target=_Blank>Startracker Campaign</a> it was observed that so far nobody seems to have chosen the good old Bloodhound for beating the campaign. So I set out to rectify this ...
<br />
<br />Since the Bloodhound can be gotten at level 2 - that is, immediately after the end of mission 1 - it seems only fair to conclude that it <b>should </b> be gotten at that point of a Bloodhound Campaign. So I flew mission 1 in the usual Starflier with 3 x Lavablade Mk I but this time I did not fill my hold with Boron while on Pittsburgh; instead, I filled it with H-fuel from one of the DSE depots near Baltimore Shipyard right after the end of the mission (the Bloodhound is a <b>pirate </b> ship, innit? <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ). Then I set sail for Rochester where I sold the H-fuel and picked up the Bloodhound; I returned to Manhattan by way of Baltimore Shipyard to pick up some more of the H-fuel ... I also vandalized two pods of the scrap metal depot, upping the count of smashed DSE depots to six. 
<br />
<br />Since the Bloodhound has a forward-firing turret slot and since most interesting turrets have 700 m/s speed, I wanted Xenos Adv. Scorpions for the Bloodhound. But I did not want to spend an hour shooting Startrackers in the Silverton Asteroid field yet again, that is why I opted to buy the guns instead and this requires rep adjustment on the order of 8 police depots plus 6 DSE ones.
<br />
<br />Then I decided that I needed to be rich during mission 3, so that the Outcasts would drop some decent guns for me. Therefore I did a grand tour of the wrecks after mission 2 ended on Battleship Missouri: Aggressor, Patrol 27, Prudhoe, Avenger. I docked with Beaumont Base in order to trade the 20 diamonds from the Prudhoe for 15 cardamine (Bloodhound has 35 cargo space) and also to replenish nanos; then I returned to Manhattan via the Flint to pick up the 20 cardamine. After launching from Manhattan with marching orders for California Minor I immediately turned right, where I vandalized the two police depots in order to show the Xenos that Trent is a guy worthy of buying nice guns. Then I proceeded to Ouray Base by way of the Colorado jumphole, returning to New York via tradelanes and the jumpgate in order to drop off the polymers at Baltimore Shipyard. When I launched from Baltimore the Bloodhound immediately turned towards the H-fuel depot and started firing; I took the hint and tractored the H-fuel for sale on Willard. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />During these missions the Bloodhound performed pretty badly compared to the Starflier and the Patriot - being unable to dodge well it took quite a bit of fire, especially from the Patriots at the depots (this did not bode well for mission 11). From then on the campaign was pretty normal; I picked up various equipment pieces as they became available (Heavy Thruster, Slingshot launcher, Rowlett's Revenge, Adv. Stunpulse, class 3 graviton shield, Razor mines). The Outcasts dropped one Dragoon gun and one Dragoon turret - I would have preferred two guns instead since I was going to pick up the Pyros Turret Type 1 from the Balboa anyway ...
<br />
<br />The campaign was pretty uneventful during missions 4 through 8 since the Bloodhound is adequate for this portion of the campaign and I had decent equipment. I got one cruiser near Manhattan, the cruiser blocking the exit out of Leeds (pure luck since I was still working on it when Tobias showed up) plus Battleship Schiller and one cruiser in Tau-29. When Battleship Schiller failed to register yet again, just like in earlier campaigns, I looked into the .ini file and guess what I found ... Yes, it is a mission solar, not a ship. And so far there has been no case of a 'solar' battleship registering as a kill, ever.
<br />
<br />During this part of the campaign one of the Bloodhound's biggest disadvantages compared to the Dagger showed clearly: on the Bloodhound you can have either a Slingshot launcher or an Adv. Stunpulse in addition to a decent set of hull guns - on the Dagger you can have both at the same time. With the Adv. Stunpulse you can hammer shields pretty fast but the hull takes quite a bit of time without Slingshots; without Adv. Stunpulse the shields of the Valkyries/Dragons take very long to beat down. Also, the Bloodhound seemed to take more damage than the Dagger, which is probably due to its size and lack of punch (manoeuvrability parameters are exactly equal).
<br />
<br />On Kyoto I had to take a freelance mission in order to level up but I did not mind since I welcomed the chance to get a bit of combat experience against Naval Dragons. I loaded Dragoons into the class 4 gun slots (more damage + range than the Adv. Scorpions, but less efficient) to see how they work in combat. The result was discouraging - after taking out the first two ships the powerplant was depleted during the whole skirmish, and I had to use shield batteries even though the random mission Dragon encounters are easier than mission 9. In dogfights the 600 m/s Pyros Type 1s that I had bought on Cali do not mix well with the 700 m/s turret and the 750 m/s pulse gun, and so I equipped Adv. Scorpions before setting sail for Tekagi's Arch.
<br />
<br />The first time I managed to get past the initial patrol with 14 batts and 12 nanos. When I still had 14 batts after taking out 3 gennies I thought this was a good time to investigate the spot above the Kusari battleship that NukeIt had mentioned. Bad move. The area was swarming with fighters and when I flew past the battleship one moment I had almost full shields and the next moment I was a fireball - when I heard 'shield failed' message I was already looking at the 'you are dead' screen. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  The second time I had to use batts during the patrol encounter but I did not stray away at the Arch and so the rest was uneventful.</div>

			<div class="content"><i>This is the second part of the article. I had to split it because the server kept cr*pping. </i>
<br />
<br />For mission 10 I kept the 'fighter combat' loadout because I wanted to be able to defend against the Valkyries effectively should need arise. In the Sigma-13 skirmish I headed straight for the weakest prey - Cruiser RNC Greifswald at the near left end of the fleet, which was basically without any cover whatsoever (no fighters, nearby battleship ineffective). Even so I had to spent all batts/nanos and plenty of Drillers on that cruiser; afterwards I concentrated on the fighers and stayed well away from the other cruisers/battleships ... At the shipyard I went straight to one of the experimental battleships, parked inside it as usual and started hammering away at it. When it blew up I still had full supplies of nanos/batts and explosives, and so I started to look around for a cruiser with weak or no cover from other cruisers/battleships/gunboats but Von Claussen started nagging pretty soon and so I simply left.
<br />
<br />As expected, mission 11 was the hardest. The first time around the evil Patriots near the satellite toasted me and so I went straight for the satellite the second time. I thought maybe the story would proceed if I blew up the satellite but the only result was that I got a new objective of 'destroy enemy ships'. Of course, Juni and King had not even dented the shields of any of the Patriots while I was taking out the satellite ... I had to destroy four of the &#220;ber-Patriots myself which cost me most of my nanos/batts. I lost the rest of the nanos/batts (including those that I had looted in Zone 21) in the skirmish in Alaska so that I returned to New York with no nanos/batts and about 45% hull. Bad move. When the game stopped my ship - presumably so that I could listen to the message from the Omaha without interference from engine noise - I hit the pedal immediately and re-entered cruise before the chasing Nomads came into gun range. Even so I fireballed three times because of the stop during the 'Osiris uncloaks' cutscene. Before the cutscene the nearest enemy was about 1.5 km away, after the end of the cutscene there were Nomads all around me between 60 and 75 m away - I was blown to bits before I even got control of the ship ... The fourth time I managed to get away with no shield and about 15% hull; I cruised and dodged until the shield was recharged and then I docked.
<br />
<br />Mission 12 was uneventful. Driller mines took care of the generators; this left plenty of Slingshots for the skirmish at the jumphole and so I could loot nanos/batts from the Interceptors at the same rate as I consumed them. For mission 13 I mounted the Pyros Type 1 guns that I had bought on Cali despite the speed mismatch between guns and turret, since I was certain that the gennies would not try to dodge. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Nothing special, except that I was careful not to get caught with shields down because the fins/wings of the Bloodhound fall off rather easily (they even exploded all by themselves when I looted the wrecks in Texas, which gave me quite a scare). At the Nomad jumpgate I parked the Bloodhound in one of the cracks of the jumpgate to fire at the Nomad battleship, in order to conserve batteries for the four gennies at The Barrier. I went through all 14 batts while taking out the gennies at The Barrier but I did not bother to buy new ones from the Interceptors since I was sure that after this there was no danger for the fins/wings of the Bloodhound, even without batts. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Conclusion: in a hairy situation I'd rather sit in a Starflier, Patriot or Dagger. Starflier and Patriot can hold out indefinitely because they can dodge well and so their smaller damage output does not matter; the Dagger can compensate by dishing out more than the Bloodhound (and it seems to have a smaller profile so that it gets hit less). The only saving grace of the chicken is that it is the only fighter with 35 cargo space that can be gotten at level 2, and that it is cheaper than the Dagger. The Defender can be gotten at level 2 as well and costs the same, but while it is a much better fighter it has a smaller cargo hold (loot!).
