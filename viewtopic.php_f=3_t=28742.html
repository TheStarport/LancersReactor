			<div class="content">I was looking for EVERYTHING i can find about freelancer (im a fanatic like that) and i came across THIS horrific review. i like destroying other peoples logic, so  here it is, straight from <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com">www.gamefaqs.com</a><!-- w -->.
<br />
<br /><i>Review by clowning 
<br />  I was very skeptical about buying this game, but then I read the box and did something I almost never do...believe the marketing lies. This game was billed as a free-roving game, where you could abandon the storyline and explore the universe...be a smuggler, a pirate, a merchant.... Wrong! I bought the game because the ads reminded me of an old seafaring merchant game I used to play on the SNES (I can't remember the name of it). In that game you really could be a pirate or a merchant, depending on how you wanted to play. I remembered that game fondly, and thought that maybe freelancer would be like that but in space. Again...wrong! 
<br />
<br />Other than great sound and graphics and a huge environment, this game is outright dull. The totally linear storyline is foreshadowed from the very beginning, the characters are stale and stereotypical and the AI is the worst I have ever seen in a space sim. 
<br />
<br />In combat, all enemy ships attack you, period. Nothing else matters. That means you'll spend most of your time running and hiding and dodging while your allies finish off the enemy, and they take a while to do it. And it gets worst. Most missions are solo missions, where you are outnumbered and outgunned, sometimes massively so. If you are not good at sims, you will never get past the story without god mode, unless you are willing to spend the time to get good. Unfortunately, this game does not encourage that desire after the first ten hours or so. Many of the missions are absurdly hard. Combine that with the inability to save the game while in space, and you have a game where you spend half your time staring at the screen while your ship travels through a jumpgate in-between reloads and flying to missions. Space travel would not be bad in this game if there was something to do, but the fact is, there is only one thing to actually DO in this game...fight. And the fighting gets very hard at times, and is very boring after a while. All missions are the same... ''go there, kill that,'' with sometimes a ''capture that'' thrown in for good measure. Despite the enormity of the game, play is very limited. 
<br />
<br />The other problem with this game is its linearity. The SP requires you to follow the story if you want to gain access to better ships and equipment and planets. You could trade your way to a million credits, but it would not matter, that larger freighter will never appear in the list of ships to purchase because you are not high enough level. And how do you increase your level, you ask? By playing the storyline. There is one plus to this, though, and that is that after beating the game, you can actually be whatever you want to be. Unfortunately, there is no real incentive to be anything but tired of the game. And travel takes so long and is so boring, despite the occasional pirate attack, that you probably won't want to be anything other than a player of some other game. Playing as a merchant, or anything else in this game, is not rewarding, because there is nothing to get out of it. 
<br />
<br />Finally, the factions are mostly irrelevant. You can't join any of them (you're a freelancer, remember?), and during the story they go from love to hate in a single mission as the story develops. Some weapons will not be sold to you if the faction does not like you enough, but that won't really affect you, you can always buy something comparable. 
<br />
<br />In short, this is another lousy game to populate the lousy-game shelf. It is huge and promises a lot, but delivers almost none of its claims.

<br />Trent: Sure, as long as I'm not shot at, knocked out, held at gunpoint, electrocuted, skewered alive by giant alien shapeshifters, have to dive out windows, or fight off spindly nomad incubi.

			<div class="content">this reviewer has obviously never actually tried to play FL, and he doesnt seem like a particularly good gamer at all.
<br />
<br />he states that some missions are &quot;incredibly difficult&quot;... however, many people can manage them in at least a falcon, with many more doing missions in drakes, starfliers, patriots, and the occasional rhino
<br />
<br />i myself am not a... shall we say... particularly gifted gamer... *cough* (in fact i think my gaming skill was given to someone else), and i find that the missions, even the most difficult ones are not difficult in a drake, and especially not in a sabre.

			<div class="content">I can agree with some of his points. For me the meat of the game was during the story mission. Once it's over hmm.. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> But I'll stay my opinion until I actually do some freelancing.
<br />
<br />I played MMORPG before I think they should  do better than FL at doing the open-ended aspect of the game. Unfotunately this is neither MMORPG nor a story based SP campaign with multiple endings. One of the weakness of MMO is the lack of story line. And monthly fee of course. The strength is a very dynamic, progressive turns of events. A bit hard to beat w/o a constant dev update.
<br />
<br />However during the SP campaing it rocks! and to think about it for a game that costs only $20 now it's all worth it. Certainly has more value than going to the cinema <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">some of his points were correct, (missions are repetitive), but the SP campaign WAS a cakewalk, but thats why we have the difficulty editor in the ini files!
<br />put it at 2 and do a 245 k mission... its pretty hard

<br />shallow characters is just the biggest lie ever... the characters had specific personalities...

<br />the AI is the worst I have ever seen in a space sim.
<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />I think by that he meant the AI is too good, it's kicking his arse good :p and he got mad at it coz he couldnt get to beat it lol! I mean w/o a good AI how did he get overwhelmed when his shield rechages, mobs don't, he's got batterries and nanobots and can use them. He can dodge, fire missles and etc. and he needs a god mod. &gt;v&lt; 
<br />
<br />Lol yeah the characters in FL are some of the most well-developed cnes I have seen in many games. Heck it's even better than some of the characters I read from story books written by people with English phd :p  and making into the New York Times Best selling list. Juni comes to mind... simply wow.

<br />On the other hand, the open end side of the game can use a little improvement. I reckon all the bars and planets and bases are too similar. They look very different for sure, but they all &quot;feel&quot; the same to me. Privateer 1 did better in this aspect I reckon, but overall Freelancer is still a very well done game and is certainly no where near as bad as the guy thinks.</div>
