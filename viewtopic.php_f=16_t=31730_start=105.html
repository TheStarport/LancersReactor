			<div class="content">from the official site:
<br />&quot;Eight hundred years prior to the start of our story, bitter conflict divided all of mankind. A handful of colonists struck out on their own to begin anew - far away from the Earth and its turmoil. Several ships were launched with enough equipment and supplies to give the hundreds onboard a fighting chance - but since the area around far-off Sirius had never been surveyed, no one really knew what to expect. What they found was a new frontier of free-flowing natural resources, unexplored territories, great wonders and lurking dangers. Each ship, representing the clusters of people and their earthly place of origin, settled into different parts of the galaxy pre-selected by their ship-board computer to give them the best chance of survival.&quot;
<br />
<br />and for the origins of the people in ships:
<br />&quot;The Houses: Each shipboard colony that left Earth carried some memory of its origins in its name. The Liberty carried Americans, The Bretonia flew from The United Kingdom and surrounding territory, The Kusari from Asia, and the Rheinland launched with Germanic cargo.
<br />
<br />As each ship settled and colonies began to expand, they knew little about each other and their advancing development. Finally, little by little, the individual colonies found each other and began to set up trade routes to link their systems for commerce and solidarity. &quot;
<br />
<br />well i can't understand some ppl above, what make you to believe that all countries was able to go to space? i.m greek so i disagree with one of the first posts here about greece, we were a great nation at the ancient past but now we are just a europian country in comfusion, i don't believe we could make it to the 23 centry, most likely we and the turkey will kill each other before this time, as about africa, ffs ppl, they barely have some of the technological goodies that eu usa and etc countries have, do you really believe they could have tech to colonise the space?
<br />
<br />one or another way why should every ship carry only one nation? most likely some ships carried ppl from smaller countries around them.
<br />
<br />it is too bad that you are not from greece <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> there is a greek fanatic guy who writes some books (books? ok maybe pieces of ****) and he is saying that the greeks are from serius anyway, that our ancestors come in earth with their space ship and bring the life there, thats why the ancient greece was that great (if that was truth wtf happened then? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) anyway maybe i will translate some off these stories so you can have fun as well <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />see ya
<br />
<br />(i lost my saves can someone send me a profile or something with saves after the end of the story? cause some mods i use have problem with the  story line)</div>

			<div class="content">1st, some mods are not compatable with the story line and will often cause the game to crash or just stop working at some critical story line point. 
<br />All I can suggest that you can do, is replay the story line without mods. It's challenging...and don't blame you one iota if you find that intimidating.
<br />
<br />Now....
<br />That's an accurate description m8. I'm glad to see another soul with perception and insight.
<br />They were named after their respective &quot;Patron Nations&quot;.
<br />That does not limit them to the specific country of origin but allows for other nations associated with them.
<br />So, in actuallity...more than just 5 sole Nations were aboard the sleeper ships.
<br />There were people from all over the planet who were on the ships.
<br />Not just Americans on the Liberty.
<br />Not just British on the Britonia.
<br />Not just the Germans on the Reinland.
<br />Not just the Spanish from Spain on the Hispania.
<br />Not just the Japanese on the Kusari.
<br /> 
<br />So, you see basically...Many languages and dialects. (which would have been a very daunting task if not overwhelming for the game engine in reality)
<br />
<br />On a afterthought, I think it would have been a great and wonderfully awsome accomplishment if Microsoft and Digital Anvil had included all the national languages represented by the 5 patron nations.
<br />I think they had this in mind and THAT would have taken this game to a global scale of MMRPG. Unfortuantely, time constraints prevented this.
<br />
<br />I Salute You and with respect, admire that you are Greek. Your country and people deserve a lot of credit for the contributions your nation has made throughout  history.
<br />
<br />I would hope to see some day, that perhaps in the 23 century (where the Freelancer Intro Story begins) your nation will be truely great again. 
<br />We cannot foresee what the future will bring and Freelancer is based upon speculation during a time of world turmoil.

			<div class="content">i just had an idea..  it said the 5 nations launched their ships.. Bretonia, Liberty, Hispania, Rheinland and Kusari.  you're all saying &quot;oh what about the swiss&quot;  but those were the nations.. maybe Liberty is countries like America, Alaska and Canada combined.....
<br />
<br />Edit:  just remembered as you all say about the swiss no offence but maybe the swiss were long dead in that time?

			<div class="content">I came up with a rather interesting theoretical proposition about that. 
<br />As  result, I wrote a short story about the origins of The Order.
<br />Maybe a little far fetched, but hey...it's an idea..
<br />================================
<br />Origins of The Order.
<br />In the 23rd Century...
<br />Originally, When the nomad mother ship blasted the Star in the Sol System, General Atikus Rockford survived the resultant shockwave on the far side of Pluto. Shortly afterwards, he left for Sirius to warn the colonies about the new threat. However, during that time; a remnant of the CSF was outside the Sol System on reserve patrol when the star was blasted out of existence. They returned to find what was left of the Sol System and most fell victim to the nomad collective. Those who were assimilated by the nomads left the Sol System and headed for the unknown Edgeworlds of Sirius, slowly changing into something hybrid between nomad and human.
<br />However; there was a few who managed to escape assimilation and they found a clue left behind by General Rockford, then followed him to Sirius by a different path just ahead of the nomads, out of their reach.
<br />After his arrival in Sirius, General Rockford was met with skepticism and disbelief by the colonists regarding the news of the Solar System and the nomads. He was soon dismissed as a lunatic, stripped of his rank and soon swept away into guarded seclusion to prevent causing mass hysteria among the colonists.
<br />Now a civilian, Aticus Rockford languished in his confinement for two years until the handful of Coalition remnants arrived in Sirius. Once they located Aticus Rockford, they broke him out and soon found refuge among the ranks of the criminal element. Apparently, it was  the Liberty Rogues who listened and believed the fantastic story about their original home system being wiped out. 
<br />Rockford was then restored to his former rank of General and through  
<br />consensus of his peers established a new organization in secrecy that would take advantage of the knowledge they possessed. 
<br />This secret organization was named, The Order.
<br />Over the years they amassed knowledge and information about the nomads
<br />and followed the trail of the assimilated coalition to the edgeworlds.
<br />It was in the edgeworlds where they founded Toledo in Omicron Minor and 
<br />established their primary base of operations there in the heart of the nomad systems.
<br />
<br />That was over 800 years ago.
<br />
<br />During the last nomad conflict, Marchall Rockford, a decendant of Atikus Rockford, led a force of The Order to defeat the nomads at Dyson City and 
<br />restore peace to the Houses of Sirius. 
<br />His Flagship was a Liberty Dreadnought prototype that he and his crew 
<br />comandeered from the Liberty Navy secret shipyard in the Alaska System 
<br />accessed only through Zone 21 in the New York System.
<br />That ship was christened, the Osiris.
<br />It was during that time they also rescued the Liberty President, Jacobi from certain compromise by Chancellor Neihman who was already a host for the nomads.
<br />You know Marchall Rockford by the name, Gasper Orillion.
<br />================
<br />
<br />(The story continues on with other information regarding what transpired 
<br />during the 20 years since the battle at Dyson City)
<br />Story By: Rankor
<br />
<br />This &quot;theory&quot; story stitches the past and present together and lends credence 
<br />behind the creation of The Order. It also goes on the basis of the original 
<br />pre-release video instead of the actual release with the CD.</div>
