			<div class="content">well, we can fairly assume that there is something going on between Lee and Kara, as he was stood in the doorway to the Hall of Memory on Galactica as if he was about to comfort her, although this could have been perfectly innocent; given their history as revealed the other week, I doubt it. Did you spot that she put Kat's picture up just under the picture of Riley's girlfriend, the one that she claimed she couldn't remember the name of in the Skar episode, when she quite insightfully but very cruelly said that Kat's fear was ending up as a forgotten picture? Kat did end up as picture, but no-one will be forgetting her. Nice touch there, if a tad sentimental - but I'm a sucker for sentimentality <img src=smilies/icon_smile_blush.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />We find out what's going on between them in the next episode when Lee and Anders are down on the algae planet together - we also find out what the Eye of Jupiter actually is. Some clue or device in a temple, that shows the way to Earth, I think<img src=smilies/icon_smile_question.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />
<br />I particularly enjoy how plot elements from TOS are being re-imagined in BSG - The Passage was a good spin on Saga of a Star World, and that ties in well with this week's episode The Eye of Jupiter which reworks Lost Planet of the Gods (but so did Home, Part 2) Hmm, in Lost Planet of the Gods it was Cerina, Boxey's mother, who died after a Cylon ambush, but Kat died last week. Will Sharon &quot;Athena&quot; die this week? I'll find out in about an hour!

<br />
<br />well that was intense! BSG back to its hign dramatic standards at last <img src=smilies/icon_smile_approve.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> here's the synopsis JD
<br />
<br />on the muck planet, the Colonials are processing algae. Starbuck arrives dramatically in a Raptor and Lee makes cr*p excuses to Dualla so he can go and get it on with Kara in the Raptor, but both he and Starbuck are having guilt feelings - she won't divorce Sam, Lee feels bad about cheating on D. The Chief keeps getting weird feelings about a cleft peak in the distance, and eventually wanders off by himself. He discovers an ancient passage that leads him to a huge undergorund complex, which he recognises from his parents' prayer books as The Temple of Five, the legendary repository of the Eye of Jupiter which points the way to Earth, and clear evidence of the presence of the 13th Tribe. He contacts Galactica and they send down a survey team but can't figure out how to get the Temple to work.
<br />
<br />The Cylons intercept the transmissions and jump 4 Basestars in, Adama sends the Fleet away, but the Cylons don't attack. Instead, Balthar calls Adama on the radio and says they want to meet him, they're sending a Heavy Raider over for a parley. When it arrives' there's Balthar, Xena, Al off Quantum Leap, and Boomer. Balthar tells his internal 6 that it feels like he's come home, but she tells him not to be stupid, the Colonials would throw him out of the airlock and have a party afterwards. Athena tells Col Tigh that it's Boomer, the one who shot the Admiral, and he denies her entry to the meeting. She stays outside with Athena. 
<br />
<br />In the meeting, Xena cuts to the chase and tells Adama and Roslin that they know the Colonials have the Eye, that they obv don't know how to use it, and that if they give the Cylons the Eye, they'll be free to go, and to sweeten the deal Al says they'll throw in Balthar. Tempting though this is, the Admiral says that if the Cylons make a move towards the Temple, he'll nuke the planet. Xena says he's bluffing and towers over him, but he stares her down (or up, as she's at least a foot taller than him) and sends them packing. Outside, Boomer tells Athena thats hera is alive and on one of the Basestars and isn't well. No wonder, the poor little mite is stuck in a big cold room with Centurions for company.
<br />
<br />Back on the Basestar, the Cylons debate what to do next. Al says this is a golden opportunity to destroy Galactica and rid the universe of the human pestilence once and for all. The Leobens and 6s disagree, as does Xena and the 3s. Xena reveals that she's sent troops down to the planet in advance to get past Galactica's DRADIS and to take the Eye by force. The other Cylons are perturbed that she is not discussing her plans with them and is acting unilaterally. Later, when Xena and Balthar are privately consulting the Hybrid about the Eye and Xena's suicide visions, Caprica 6 confronts them about what they're up to and why they don't include her in whatever they're doing, seeing as how the three of them are supposed to be an item; Xena tells her quite harshly that Caprica is not part of her and Balthar's destiny anymore and that only the Chosen One (her or Balthar) can retrieve the Eye and discover the identities of the 5 unrevealed Cylons.
<br />
<br />Adama confronts Roslin about what Boomer told Sharon and she admits it's true, and that she did suspect that the Cylons had Hera. He walks out, upset, and tells Helo and Athena, who are stunned and angrily ask how he could do this to them when he of all people should know what it's like to lose a child. he tells them to be grateful that Hera is at least still alive, but Sharon says she wants to see her. Rescue mission? Marines storm the Basestar? who knows? 
<br />
<br />Adama orders the Chief to set charges in the Temple in case the Cylons try to capture it, the Chief is torn between his reverence for the holy site and his orders from the Admiral. The Cylons cut off comms between the planet and Galactica, and apollo prepares to defend the Temple with his handful of troops and some civilians, including Sam Anders. Starbuck suggests letting Sam command the civilians, and after a heated exchange, Sam agrees, but tells Apollo that he knows whats going on between him and Kara, and that Lee isn't the first - he knows what his wife is like and it was his choice to marry her. D comes up with a defence plan and briefs everyone on their roles. Starbuck is to fly recon in the Raptor, but gets shot down when she encounters the Cylon force. Sam says he's gpoing to rescue her, but Lee refuses to let him go, saying he needs him to hold the position. Sam tells him to go and frak himself and after another argument re: feelings for Starbuck, Lee orders the Marine Sergeant to pull a gun on Sam and prevent him leaving by force if necessary.
<br />
<br />A force of Cylon Raiders carrying Balthar and Xena start off towards the planet, the Cylons wondering if Adama will carry out his threat or if he's bluffing like Al says. In reponse, Galactica arms its nukes and loads them into the firing tubes, the Cylons can see the radiological alert and that the targeting systems are aimed at Ground Zero for the Temple complex, and finally Adama authorises release of nuclear weapons...
<br />
<br />... to be continued. 
<br />
<br />edge of the seat stuff at the end, it was excellent. So much in that episode, but you'll catch it on a reshowing soon I'm sure <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />points to consider - 
<br />
<br />Apollo and Starbuck's illicit relationship is causing many serious problems; will this prove fatal? I can see Sam becoming a victim of this, losing his life to save Starbuck in an effort to prove his love for her. So far D hasn't said or done anything, might she ignore Starbuck's predicament so as to keep Lee? I don't think so, she's not like that, but you never know.
<br />
<br />Will Xena's actions split her from the rest of the Cylons? She and Balthar clearly have a separate agenda, will they pursue it wherever it goes, even at the cost of leaving the other Cylons? Indeed, will they find their destinies down on the muck planet? We know that 3 has a distinct destiny because the Oracle said so, and that she no longer believes what the other Cylons believe. Will Balthar return to the Fleet? Will we find out who the 5 unrevealed Cylons are? Note that the Temple is the Temple of 5, and there are 5 unknown Cylon models, just as there are 12 Tribes (+1) and 12 Cylon models, 12 main gods (+1 other, the Cylon God, who is alluded to in the Scriptures) 
<br />
<br />The Chief was having weird dreams before, back before New Caprica - is he then being given visions or directions by higher powers, just like Pres Roslin or 3? Indeed, many of the characters seem to be agents of destiny, including Adama even though he doesn't like to think so - after all, he come up with the idea of going to Earth thinking it's just a device to give hope to people,and it turns out to be true. Starbuck captures a Cylon Raider to get home to Galactica and ends up using it to retrieve the Arrow of Apollo to find the way to Earth. Roslin takes chamalla to ease her symptons and has visions of the past that turn out to be true. Evey step Balthar takes brings him coser to the Cylons to the point that he thinks he might be one of them. 
<br />
<br />One thing is clear however - Adama did <i>not </i> know that Roslin faked Hera's death, so he did not ever lie to Helo and Sharon about it. Whether they believe that or not isn't entirely clear, Helo seemed to react as if Adama had indeed lied to him. Note that Col Tigh seems to have accepted Athena now as a fellow officer, whereas not long ago he was sl*gging her off for being a Cylon. And that Boomer seemed rather put out by Athena having replaced her, although she seems to have accepted her role now as part of the Cylon - no more clinging on to her human memories, for the most part.
<br />
<br />Oh yeh I forgot to add, the star the muck planet orbits is about to go supernova! Gaeta analysed it and noted the high improbability of both the Colonials and the Cylons turning up at this place both at the same time, both after the way to Earth, just before the star is about to explode. Adama said that if it is the work of a higher power, then its got a bizarre sense of humour.

			<h3><a href="#p416874" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I'm still convinced that Balthar isn't a Cylon. However as for your speculation that he might be a 13th Cylon, or some sort of archetype or unique model, well, possibly. However his human credentials seem pretty much assured - he wasn't affected by the virus on the Basestar in the Lion Nebula; Admiral Cain, Pres Roslin, and others such as Helo recognised him from public life on Caprica from well before the Cylon infiltration; and his internal 6 insists he's human, physiologically at least. Emotionally and mentally he's more akin to the Cylons, as internal 6 and the Cylons themselves have pointed out on several occasions. I still think his role is that of an agent of the Cylon God or whatever, and that he becomes more like the Cylons but actually isn't, just as Athena becomes more like the humans, but isn't. 
<br />
<br />Interestingly, in this weeks episode, when Roslin was consulting the Scriptures regarding the Temple of Five, the Sacred Scrolls said that the five pillars inside the temple were fashioned after the five priests devoted to &quot;The One Whose Name Cannot Be Told.&quot; Is this a reference to the Cylon God who was once one of the humans' pantheon but rebelled, as Priest Elosha told Balthar in a deleted scene? If so, then the Thirteenth Tribe worshipped the Cylon God! which might explain why they left the other Colonies and why the Cylons are seeking them? Goodness gracious.... 
<br />
<br />The Hybrids don't count as models. Apart fron the Leobens, the Cylons don't really seem to think of them as personalities at all. The revealed Cylon models are the Dorals, Simons, Leobens, Sharons, 6s, Xenabots, and Cavils, leaving five unaccounted for. One of Xenabot's post-suicide scribblings did appear to resemble Balthar though, iirc.

			<div class="content">only a day to go! (can't wait; but i won't get to see it till Monday night. Don't spoil it for me!)
<br />
<br />another coincidence, or not, as is more likely; not only are there 5 unknown Cylon models and Temple of Five, as we discussed earlier, but watching it again to catch up, I noticed that Galactica has <b>five </b> remaining nukes, that the Hybrid referred to the <b>five </b> &quot;lights&quot; and that the Chief quotes the scriptures as &quot;the Heavens opened and the Eye of Jupiter was revealed...&quot; 
<br />
<br />So maybe Galactica launches her nukes, and they detonate above the Temple (not inside it as planned) maybe in the upper atmosphere? and the nuclear flash activates the Temple (somehow) and it does it's thing for whoever's in there, presumable the Colonials, Xenabot and Blather. After all, it's all supposed to have happened before, will happen again, cycle of time and all that. In a way I suppose it doesn't matter what they do or don't do, it's all predestined. Personally I'd go have a cup of tea and a ciggie, and wait and see what happened; why bother fighting? <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />oh yeh, the murdering Cylon Centurions down on the planet; I forgot about them for a second!

			<div class="content">well, what an episode!<img src=smilies/icon_smile_approve.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> thankfully we didn't have to wait <i>too </i> long for it.
<br />
<br />so the supernova was the Eye all along! Should have guessed that really, especially from the &quot;heavens opened and the Way was revealed&quot; riddle.
<br />
<br />I'd already begun to suspect that Sharon would kill herself to download into the Basestar so she could rescue hera, but I didn't count on 6 coming along for the ride. I wonder what's going to happen to her on board Galactica? I knew from leaks that balthar would end up back on galctica, but i thought he'd have some sort of deal to cut, maybe info about the location of Earth - instead he's just a burnt-out helpless mess, unless his internal 6 has a plan she hasn't told him yet.
<br />
<br />No more 3s? is this the end of Xenabot? what all that does tell me is that this marks a fundamental shift in the destinies of Humans and Cylons - the Humans started off as a secular society confident in their technology and achievements, but are now accepting their destinies and putting their fates and faith in the hands of the gods (or God, whatever) whereas by contrast the Cylons, who began (by their own lights) as doing God's will, have now consciously rejected the end result of that religious mssion and embraced what would appear to be a purely technological course that will presumably deny them the fruits of their labours. This is of course symbolised by their physical convergence with the humans on this critical spot and their subsequent divergence - they were the first to leave, leaving the humans to reap the rewards of perseverance and faith. 
<br />
<br />As for Starbuck, she's fortunate that D's such a good loyal soul who does her duty. Hopefully this will be the end of Lee and Kara's sordid little affair (yuk!) BTW i di clock the similarity between the pattern of the Eye mandala and the paintings in her apartment on Caprica, but only last week when I was watching some episodes from Season 2. I said before that i thought she was a messenger of the Gods, hence why it was she who went back for the Aroow of Apollo that pointed the way to earth - now it seems she is quite literally the messenger, although she didn't get to see the Temple of Five. Would she have recognised the pattern as one of her paintings if she had? Maybe she sgould take some chamalla like Roslin did and have some visions! 
<br />
<br />I must admit that I've got so used to tragic endings that I was a bit irked at the happy ending - husbands and wives reunited, Hera safe, Balthar captured (and a pistol whip from the Chief had to <i>really  </i> hurt!) and the way to Earth pointed out (partly anyway) and everyone safe and sound, apart from a few redshirts. Had to feel sorry for Xenabot though, and 6, who behaved quite decently. I wonder what made Galactica-Sharon turn bad Cylon though? was it really that she'd embraced being a Cylon at last, or jealousy that Athena-Sharon had so usurped her former role on Galactica.
<br />
<br />And just what is Internal-6 up to? Is she <i>really  </i> an angel from God as she claims? and will we see more of Caprica-6's internal Balthar from Downloaded?
<br />ah, happy days, everything's back to normal now BSG is back! (shut up FD)
