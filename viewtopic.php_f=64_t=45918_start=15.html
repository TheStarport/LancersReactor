			<div class="content">SWAT_OP-R8R, it never occurred to me, but now that you mention it, yes, I would argue that...
<br />
<br />LancersReactor should dump Spaceforce 2.
<br />
<br />...but not for the same reasons that recommend a boycott. It's rather simpler: it doesn't really belong here based on its merits, and it's only here for the moment because (at best) we had high hopes/expectations, or (at worst) we've been had. Now that we've learned that the game is radically worse than even Darkstar One, I say it should be dumped. There's literally tons of space games that are far superior to Spaceforce 2, several released yearly. Indeed the only remaining reason to hang onto the game (from my point of view, anyway) is that it's possible to mod it. (And, of course, the artwork is nice.)
<br />
<br />But LancersReactor sponsorship aside, yes I would urge individuals not to buy it. Maybe I can explain a bit more clearly than perhaps I have already. The business model which produced this game is something like &quot;ecstatic customers and deeply disappointed customers are paying customers all the same.&quot; If you buy it, then their business model works, which means future business ventures will follow this model. Next year there will be a deeply disappointing game which could have been great if only a little extra investment went into it. Basically we need to make sure that when they're doing their cost-benefit analysis, they get the feeling that the benefits of producing a good game outweigh the extra cost. -- There's only one way to vote in this contest: with your wallet.
<br />
<br />If you buy the game, your vote is cast in favor of de-prioritizing and under-budgeting gameplay, design, writing, and indeed betatesting. Somehow I don't think you want that.
<br />
<br />Ok, to try to answer your questions:
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>1. new space sim... next year? maybe you know more than we do... so what new space sim do you expect? and do you expect that LR does automatically cover it?<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Well if SpaceFarce (as people are beginning to call it) is any indication, they announced the project almost exactly one year before it was released. So by the end of the summer, and certainly by Thanksgiving we'll have a better idea what's coming out next year. I haven't heard anything, but then again I don't keep my ear to the ground.
<br />
<br />I can say that SpaceFarce looked like a real torchbearer, and those kind of games only come along every couple years maybe. So this is a giant disappointment. Opportunities like this really shouldn't be wasted.
<br />
<br />Oh, and sure, I expect (in the sense of suppose) that the chances are pretty good that lancersreactor will cover another such promising-looking game, at least until it is found to be otherwise. I'm not sure why you ask, and I'm certainly quite unclear why you would ask *me*.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>2. have you ever got any information about how the developing process of a game does look like? I can tell you that in time period of 1 year it absolutly doesnt matter how a different game was... if it was better or worse... the developers usually dont even have the time to care about such things<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Yes, I know something about the industry. Not as much as I'd like, but it's just a hobby of mine so I haven't taken a professional interest. But yeah, I think you're underestimating how much market research goes into a game. Certainly when a project is being conceived and the beginning and important decisions are being made, the developers look at what's been successful and why it's been successful, and they consider recent failures also, so they know what to avoid. It's partly a question of design, partly a question of business. It's my hope that SpaceFarce is conceived as a monumental failure in the business sense, so nobody is tempted to commit the same design atrocities.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>3. if the job done by provox is so bad... can you do it better?<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />The problem parts -- high-level design and writing -- any moderately decent writer with any knowledge whatsoever of game design could have done a phenomenally better job. The decent parts -- game engine -- no, not me personally, but that's well outside my areas of specialty. I'd love to put a team together, and I'm sure a better job would be within relatively easy reach -- that's not saying much, mind you: if I'm complimenting myself, it's rather a backhanded compliment. -- Although first I'd want to learn 3d graphics programming.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>4. well it poisons the whole genre? which genre? do you count FL to the space sim genre? sry but FL is technically not a classical space sim... its more an arcade game which doesnt really fit between all those other games such as starlancer, freespace, wing commander,...<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Call it whatever you like, and divide the genre howsoever you wish. I'm sure you take my meaning nevertheless.</div>

			<div class="content">maybe somebody (like me ^^) should should get you back to the facts
<br />
<br />1. there is no other game (space sim) coming out in a year... not announced... and not in development
<br />not to mention that if SFRU will fail the chances are very high that there wont be another SF because then it isnt worth it for provox
<br />
<br />2. the LR staff decides if new games are supported or not and not a single community member can expect that they will ever consider to support another game if its not in their interest
<br />and in the past years the community did only want... &quot;we want that game... we want this game&quot; but in the end the community did let all those games drop and all the time... all the work done by the LR staff was wasted
<br />you better shouldnt expect that those staff members waste more time with something that very likely might be dropped by this community again because they say &quot;no we want something else&quot; or &quot;we expected something better&quot;
<br />not to mention that LR is currently not able to do neccessary changes to support new games
<br />
<br />3. this morning ive found a small mail in one of my mailboxes showing how much provox and the SF community are upset and disappointed about how the game is treaten here
<br />provox games gave us the permission to cover SFRU here at LR... they supported us with neccessary information and material
<br />if you guys go on with this trashtalk against provox and SFRU and IF there is going to be a SF3 somewhen in far future then you cant expect that LR will ever get the permission to cover it here for this community</div>

			<div class="content">Sadly you can't force people to support something they don't like. Since when did anyone trash talk them? We gave our opinon about the game and if they can't take it, then tuff love.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I <b><i>was</b></i> really hoping that it was going to be a great game. It didn't live up to what it could of been.
<br /><i>IF</i> they somehow make SF3, well then good I don't want to hear about it becuase SFRU was a major disappointment for me. So it won't hurt my hopes and dreams in the long run. So if it does somehow become a great spacesim, then great I'll have something to enjoy for a bit. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /><i>Rant mode off....</i>
<br />P.S Lancers should cover a space game already out there are very nice ones around...ummm.
<br />P.S.S : Had to make my &quot;was&quot; in bold.

			<div class="content">Well IMO Provox should now listen to the complaints and start making a patch to fix all the issues I told them about in PM's to the Dev's a long time before the game was to come out. They (Dev's) assured me that this game was going to be a FL successor. Nevertheless, on release of the game it is nowhere near FL. So Provox does not like all the bad reviews then they need to read them and fix the problems that a lot of TLR members told them they needed months before a release date and a publisher was found so if they do not like all the bad reviews then instead of saying TLR members stop trashing the game they should fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
<br />
<br />They (Provox) have no one to blame but themselves. They were told, they were supposed to have been listening to the community, and they did not!!! So now Provox are you going to fix the game or cry about us not liking it when you knew we would not before release, and how you lied to many SF2 community members including myself on the type of game play and controls it was going to have. 
<br />
<br />If I wanted an X-series game, I would have bought it. I want a fun game like Freelancer there are to many X-series type games with the crappy controls, which again you said would be easier, then FL another Lie!!!!!! 
<br />
<br />Fix the game as you said it would be with a patch even if it takes a gig to fix I will review it again and see if you listened to the community or if you listened to god only knows what. 
<br />
<br />Oh and OP why don't Provox come to the official TLR SF2 forum and explain there game issues with us here instead of E-mailing you and complaining about truthful reviews?
<br />
<br />I own it to my Lancer mates to report about this game just as I did DSO who also Lied to this community from the start. Then you say we wanted this game and we wanted that game. YES WE DID BUT THE GAME DEV'S LIED ABOUT THE GAME SO NOW WE SEE IT FOR THE CRAP IT IS AND DON&quot;T WANT IT ANYMORE CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT? If a person lies to you, why would you trust them in the future? 
<br />
<br />Oh, Provox where will you stand are you going to fix the game or piss and moan about the thousands of god-awful reviews it is getting?????????????????
<br />
<br />Now that is IMO only.</div>

<br />
<br />Oh give us a break. Your Holiness. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>1. there is no other game (space sim) coming out in a year... not announced... and not in development<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />It is wise of a man to become less certain of his facts. A quick google search turns up the &quot;Tarr Chronicles&quot; coming out perhaps as early as September. It looks pretty promising. There's a trailer available. It's pretty short, but it looks quite decent. Another Freelancer-esque, it would seem. Hmm, says it was at the E3, which means it should be familiar to anyone who keeps up with this sort of thing.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>not to mention that if SFRU will fail the chances are very high that there wont be another SF because then it isnt worth it for provox<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Let us hope it fails, then. The genre was damaged by SF2, or at least it will be if SF2 is judged a success by any definition. The reason it is wise to hope for a failure of SF2 is because we don't want products like what SF3 would probably be.
<br />
<br />Surely we shouldn't support a crap game on principle, in the hope that in doing so we will encourage the production of crap games in the future.
<br />
<br />If Provox fails, it is not the customers' fault. If people don't like a bad game, it's the bad game's fault. More precisely, it's the developers' fault, and even more precisely, it's the business model's fault. It is in the interest of the genre for this business model to fail, and I think it will because this business model runs against the interest of the genre.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>2. the LR staff decides if new games are supported or not and not a single community member can expect that they will ever consider to support another game if its not in their interest
<br />and in the past years the community did only want... &quot;we want that game... we want this game&quot; but in the end the community did let all those games drop and all the time... all the work done by the LR staff was wasted
<br />you better shouldnt expect that those staff members waste more time with something that very likely might be dropped by this community again because they say &quot;no we want something else&quot; or &quot;we expected something better&quot;
<br />not to mention that LR is currently not able to do neccessary changes to support new games<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I'm not sure the relevance of all this. I think the story runs something like this: The community is strongly interested in the game, the game turns out to be a stinker, and the community becomes uninterested. It seems rather perverse that one might blame the community for this loss of interest. Wouldn't one instead get mad at the game developers for making such a stinker?
<br />
<br />If it makes you feel any better, setting up all the pages, resources, forum etc. takes only a few hours, a day of casual work by one person. It's still work -- hey who wants to throw away a day? -- but it's not as huge as one might imagine.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>3. this morning ive found a small mail in one of my mailboxes showing how much provox and the SF community are upset and disappointed about how the game is treaten here
<br />provox games gave us the permission to cover SFRU here at LR... they supported us with neccessary information and material
<br />if you guys go on with this trashtalk against provox and SFRU and IF there is going to be a SF3 somewhen in far future then you cant expect that LR will ever get the permission to cover it here for this community<hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />This is disappointing, but not surprising, knowing their recent history. They aggressively censor criticism on their official forum, and they wish they could censor criticism here as well. I, for one, am very happy to engage in open discussion, without fear or reprisal.
<br />
<br />(Oh, and &quot;trashtalk&quot; is a little strong, don't you think? I think everyone is well within the bounds of polite discussion.)</div>

			<h3><a href="#p423960" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">The fact is that all the games mentioned in this thread have been ripped apart by magazine reviews,website reviews,television reviews and now the player reviews...us.
<br />
<br />If the dev's want to spit that dummy out coz a group of people who (in all basic terms) are paying them to play what is (imho) a below-average game (on another website i gave SF:RU 45% in a review) then really they should not be thinking &quot;eww..they slagged us off!we're not gonna let them cover any more games of ours&quot;
<br />
<br />They should be thinking &quot;ok,where did we go wrong and what can this group of players tell us about it so we can fix it?&quot; That in my mind is the right thing they should do. The basic fact is that while you can show us the screenshots/in-game action pictures and press releases we will never know if we like something untill we have the demo on our PC's and play them. The sad fact that the last batch of space-sim/space-action games have been average at best. In one gaming magazine Freelancer is still ranked as 2nd behind Eve and ahead of X3 (according them X3's controls are confusing,hence it being 3rd..i agree actually) Now this is quite a sad fact and i agree with the others here who say that perhaps they really do need to go back to basics and work from gameplay up...graphics will only keep people content for so long as COD 2 found out when it was 1st realeased.
<br />
<br />
<br />What i will say is let everyone have their opinion,which means Op, you have your right to your opinion,but please for once stop trying to shove it down everyone's throats and let someone else have their say without feeling they're gonna get bashed by you straight away.
<br />
<br />To everyone else,perhaps not disecting Op's posts might be a good idea? He is rather good at these sorts of threads and they usually end up getting locked by a Mod who get's fed up of it..it destroys the what i 1st thought was constructive criticism.

			<div class="content">OK PEOPLE, STOP SHOUTING AND FIGHTING HERE AND GOING ON ABOUT ITS MY OPINION BECAUSE I AM NOT BUYING IT!
<br />
<br />I love Freelancer, i fell in love as soon as i saw the start menu, i have had many happy years on it, i have played a lot and know how to make money quickly!
<br />
<br />Really guys, i am glad NONE of you are lawyers because most of you go around saying we are voicing our opinion but really i see SOME of you saying e.g. &quot;Its time for the staff to listen to our COMPLAINTS.&quot;
<br />
<br />Is that an opinion or a complaint?
<br />
<br />And the devs are already working on patchs so go over to the forums and tell them there mistakes, the bugs the glitches and whatever else you dont like and they will try and fix them all. 
<br />
<br />No point bashing it here hoping that another cool game like Freelancer will come along next month is there?
<br />
<br />So guys really please stop bashing the game and be friends, the forums have there own modding section and already the Planets they have changed in-game look better than our real planet from space!</div>

<br />
<br />That is good news and I am waiting on the controls patch to make controls easier then they are I have also voiced my opinion to Provox, and on the forum as well as here. Therefore, I am waiting and hoping for the best. I have this game and see a lot that can be done but modding it will not change many problems it has.
<br />
<br />@OP
<br />
<br />I understand where you are coming from, but with out our complaints/reviews Provox would think the game was perfect and do nothing to change it.
