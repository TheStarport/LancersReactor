<br />Ever wondered why there were pulse weapons, but nothing that did exclusively hull damage, well here's two series of weapons that fit that mold - they deal immense hull damage and no shield damage.
<br />This mod adds six weapons that we all know well as machine guns and howitzers. These weapons deal absolutely no damage to shields (except slight damage to molecular), but deal grievous damage to hulls. These weapons are intended to be counterparts to pulse weapons, and with the right mix of pulse and mass driver weapons, kills can come extremely easily.
<br />These weapons include their own sound effects.
<br />These weapons are added to your arsenal:
<br />Poison Light Mass Driver (Class 3)
<br />Toxin Light Mass Driver (Class 6)
<br />Venom Light Mass Driver (Class 9)
<br />Hammer Heavy Mass Driver (Class 4)
<br />Sledgehammer Heavy Mass Driver (Class 7)
<br />Warhammer Heavy Mass Driver (Class 10)
<br />The weapons are sold on Planets Manhattan, New London, New Tokyo, New Berlin, Malta, and Crete.

<br />&quot;Mission 01: Patriot to Avenge the Donau&quot;
<br />dated Dec 20, 2002 at 01:22 hrs.
<br />You can actually mount multiple weapon onto a single hardpoint!
<br />Here is an example for you to see yourself and try it out:
<br />* No modding required. *
<br />You start after meeting up with King to do the 1st mission and 5 unidentified ships just destroyed a Rheinland cruiser.
<br />The ship you fly is *the* Patriot, equipped with:
<br />- 2 advanced thrusters
<br />- 2 Titan's class power generator
<br />- top class weapon and shield (not uber shield, though)
<br />The interesting thing is that there are 3 weapon mounted on each weapon hardpoint.
<br />The weapon could be a gun, missile launcher, or even turret. For example, one of this ship's hardpoint is carrying a Kraken Type 2 gun, a Nomad cannon, and Skyblast B turret. I'm guessing that one can mount any number of weapon to the hardpoint (what's the limit?).
<br />The torpedo hardpoint consists of both a cruise disruptor and a torpedo launcher which to be fired separately as normal.
<br />When you drop a mine, you'll be dropping 2 simultaneously (a Screamer and a Ripper).

<br />Description:
<br />&quot;Start missions from Level 20&quot;
<br />Personally, I prefer starting the Single Player campaign from level 20. This way, you have the option for buying higher level weapon, equipment, even ships! Now you have a wider range of possibilities for planning a
<br />'maximum fun campaign' (quoting Sherlog).
<br /><b>1. Level20SP.fl </b>
<br />Titled 'Level 20: Begin Single Player Campaign'
<br />(Dated Dec 14, 2002 on the Load Game list)
<br />I modified the level so the story begins at level 20.
<br />Hints:
<br />- After completing 1st mission, although the jump gates
<br />in New York are still locked, you can get out of the
<br />system through the jump holes, if you can find 'em.
<br />- Level up first, then upgrade your equipment / weapon /
<br />ship, *then* go meet up with Juni
<br />- Use the small blue rectangle on top-left of each weapon
<br />icon to mount / unmount them (look at your cargo card)
<br />when you're on a base / planet / station
<br /><b>2. Advantage.fl </b>
<br />'Mission 01: Starflier at Manhattan, New York'
<br />(Dated Dec 15, 2002)
<br />An &quot;improved&quot; version of the first file.
<br />You are at the beginning of the 1st mission, after accepting Juni's offer. You have an additional 10 million credits and your ship cargo includes weapon / equipment not obtainable anywhere in Sirius (unless modded).
<br /><b>3. JuniShip.fl </b>
<br />'Mission 01: Juni's Ship to Avenge the Donau'
<br />(Dated Dec 17, 2002)
<br />Fly the same class of ship that Juni uses. The Donau had just been destroyed. Starts at Level 20. I include this as an extra.
<br />Hints:
<br />- Keep the pre-mounted gun / turret configuration.
<br />- You don't have to change your ship during the game.
<br />The ZIP file contains 3 save-game files. Just put them in your single player directory, where the rest of *.fl files are. *No MOD-ing required*
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=616' Target=_Blank> <b>Invisible Beam mod and Fast engine mod made by Eugene </b> </a>
<br />This file contains two mods.
<br /><b>Invisible Beam mod </b>
<br />This mod is simple. It just speeds up the velocity and refire rate of all buyable energy weapons. It will turn all refire rates to the max possible, and speeds up the weapon to 100 times its normal speed.
<br /><b>Fast engine mod </b> 
<br />This mod is simple. It just speeds up all flyable ship engines to 180 instead of just 80.
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=610' Target=_Blank> <b>Modified New SinglePlayer saved game made by John </b> </a>
<br />Description:
<br />This ZIP file contains one save game file: Msn01OrderShip.fl
<br />Put it in your SinglePlayer save game directory, where the rest of *.fl files are.
<br />The default directory for Freelancer singleplayer saved games is in:
<br />My Documents\My Games\Freelancer\Accts\SinglePlayer
<br />The saved game is titled &quot;Mission 01: The Order Ship to Avenge the Donau&quot; in the Load Game list. Dated Dec 19, '02 (19:27 hrs)
<br /><b>Newly discovered capabilities </b>
<br />- 3 Engines
<br />- 3 Thrusters
<br />- 3 Torpedoes
<br />- 7 Weapon hard points
<br />The ship is pre-configured to mount 2 engines only. The 3rd torpedo hard point is used to mount Cannonball missile launcher instead of a torpedo or cruise disruptor. Kraken Type 2 is mounted on the 7th hard point and I use the HF Uber Shield as the shield. This configuration cannot be changed unless you buy another ship. FL *will crash* if you try to unmount the Uber Shield.
<br />The double engine will give you a speed advantage, i.e. 2 x 80 units of maximum non-cruising speed. Each thruster will add 120 units, giving a total extra push of 360. Now, you can choose whether to use thrusters or the usual cruising to beat Hovis.

<br />The answer is so simple, just use this mod and it'll start telling you the truth.
<br />The truth is: This mod just changes &quot;LOADING&quot; to &quot;SMOKING CARDAMINE&quot;

<br />This missile is basically a cruise disruptor with an enormous range. It has a maximum range of 10km and a speed of 3000m/s, so it reaches its target almost instantaneously. The weapon takes 2000 energy to fire, but if you're in pursuit of a target that already got far away, this weapon represents a slim glimmer hope of delaying them enough for you to catch up.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=590' Target=_Blank> <b>GTB Medusa made by Caid </b> </a>
<br />The Medusa Bomber comes with Tsunami bombs (about 6000 hull damage, beware big blast), Avenger Cannon, D-Missiles, 3 defensive turrets, 2 mine launchers and a large Cargo space. It is a rather unwieldy craft, but if you'll mix it with some battleship encounter mod, it would be the best choice ever! For sale at the Battleship Westfalen in the Hamburg System. Before you launch, don't forget to buy ammo for the Tsumami bomb, D-Missile and mine launchers.</div>

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=589' Target=_Blank> <b>Cruise Missiles made by Silver_Fire </b> </a>
<br />This mod adds two new weapons mountable on the torpedo hardpoint:
<br />Longbow Cruise Missile
<br />Crossbow Cruise Missile
<br />These missiles are meant to be a hybrid between missiles and torpedoes, taking a mix of speed and power. Each missile has a range longer than that of torpedoes and a speed of around 230m/s, which is well over the speed of missiles, but thankfully, under cruise speed.
<br />These cruise missile launchers are sold on the capital planet of each house, including Malta.
<br />
<br />

<br />The Osiris Mod has been expanded a bit just from the Osiris and Anus. Now you have an armored transport, you may want to go out and mine a little bit. But why mine in that, when you can mine YOU VERY OWN MINERS SHIP.
<br />Yes coming right out of the mining fields is your very own miner ship. Although handling is poor, you wont be going very far or fast, you arent in a fighter, remember that and remember this mod is about the realism factor. 
<br />It is a rather large ship, but very cool. Now you ask yourself how do I mine if I have to sit there and shoot a billion little rocks. Well from now on every time you shoot an asteroid, you will get something. Kind of makes sense right. Also the four transports have been added. Best of all the Order now has its own system and can be accessible through a gate in Shikoku. Close to Planet Seti. In there as of now there is one planet, in which they sell the Anubis and the Osiris.

<br />Features include:
<br />All your favorites from the standard game, but most are tweaked.
<br />Capital ships that fly correctly! Woo Hoo!
<br />&quot;The Wanderer Fleet&quot;:
<br />The SlipStream by Firebase and Wanderer
<br />The LongSword MK II by Wassup and Wanderer - Beautiful flight characteristics
<br />The Tempest - BIG
<br />The Naginata by Wanderer - BIG
<br />The Javelin by Wanderer - BIGGER
<br />The Balistner by Wanderer - Uh...REAL BIG or UNREAL - 75 GUNS? BIGGEST FOR SURE
<br />The Citadel. A massive and heavily armed multi-platform Base by Wanderer - BIG BEYOND ALL REALITY - OVER 100 GUNS
<br />Assistance with the massive turrets on these ships was provided by RedEye.
<br />Wanderer's ships have never before appeared in a multi-player mod. They are truly something to see, but you won't see them for long because you will be shredded if you get near one. And DO NOT fire at the Citadel. If you make it angry it will shred you and your computer. Most of it's weapons are homing weapons and you can't escape. So respect it.
<br />Special Adaptations of Non-Flyables converted to Flyables by Glock36:
<br />&quot;The Nomad Fleet&quot;:
<br />The Nomad Fighter
<br />The Nomad Gunboat
<br />The Nomad Battleship
<br />They are armed with new beam weapons and other new features.
<br />900 kph in a battleship with 4 thrusters?
<br />&quot;Other Big Ships&quot;:
<br />The Bretonia Gunboat
<br />The Kusari Gunboat
<br />The Rheinland Gunboat
<br />The Bretona Destroyer
<br />The Kusari Destroyer
<br />The Liberty Cruiser (and you can aim that big forward gun!).
<br />All these ships have been attacked with the UTF editor and have additions that will make them very useful against those players who can obtain one of Wanderer's ships. But don't count on surviving.
<br />&quot;Favorites by Porsche&quot;:
<br />The A-Wing
<br />The B-Wing
<br />The Sith Infiltrator
<br />With respect to Porsche, we had to beef these up a bit in order to maintain some balance, but the graphics were not modified in any way. They still look and fly just as he intended them to. They just survive better.
<br />&quot;Custom Ship by UltraLeonWorks&quot;:
<br />The DarkFighter
<br />There are jump holes from Manhattan to the &quot;Unknown Systems&quot;. Many people know these as the &quot;Easter Egg Systems.&quot; The one with two planets is the home of the &quot; Wanderer Fleet&quot;. The other is new home Planet of the Nomads and other strange political bedfellows.
<br />This mod is &quot;Player Oriented&quot;. We kept the bells and whistles to a minimum and focused on packing in as much fun as we could by using what Microsoft provided. However, there is plenty there for the experienced player to enjoy and new things not yet seen in Freelancer. We expect most of the action to take place in Liberty Space and in the Unknown Systems. Again, this mod is geared for a multi-player environment.

<br />This mod adds upgradeable power supplies and upgradeable armor. The Pegasus light fighter is available at Houston and New London ship dealers. Power and armor is spread through the story line planets and bases as well as a couple of Freeports. Not all will have them available, so you'll have to watch for them. You will also be able to mount up to 4 class 10 weapons on any ship in the game, depending on how many hardpoints the ship has. All ships will be able to mount class 10 shields as well. Of course, all pilot level restrictions apply, both to weapons and shields as well as the new power and armor upgrades.

<br />This mod removes all the ground-based cut scenes from the Single Player story line missions, saving you a couple hours of time in playing the campaign.
<br />You still have to watch all of the cut scenes done in the spaceflight graphics engine (including Freeport 7 blowing up in the beginning), but most of them aren't that long.
<br />To use without Freelancer Mod Manager, just unzip the file into your Freelancer directory (make sure to backup everything in the Data\Missions folder.)
<br />To use with the Freelancer Mod Manager, create a directory named Campaign Cut Scenes Disabled in your Freelancer Mod Manager\Mods directory and unzip the file to there.
<br />WARNING: there is an issue that I have not been able to solve. With this mod, the game allows you to choose &quot;Decline&quot; for missions 11, 12, and 13, which you aren't supposed to be able to do. If you decline these, the game crashes either immediately or when you launch again. Choose &quot;Accept&quot; and there is no problem, however.

<br /><b>Ringworld is not a working Mod, </b> its an addon for other mods.
<br />Ringworld is not a mod, it will not work if you simply drop it into FLMMs mod folder no matter how hard you try. What this archive contains is a collection of cut and paste ini additions that YOU can use to add the new Ringworld system to your own installation of Freelancer or ANY other mod. I am releasing Ringworld for use by mod makers rather than players. Mod makers will know how to get it working in their mod and because all the additions are not berried in Hostile Universe, they should find it easy to grab what they need.
<br />Also because it is not a mod, this system can be added to any other mod, so you can add it to your own favorite mod without causing any problems (except for the base names in the dlls that is). This document will explain how to get Ringworld working if your unsure. Experienced mod makers can simply read my notes in the Additions files one by one.
<br />Fixes in Version 2
<br />Plant entries starting with &quot;nickname = rw01_01a&quot; &amp; &quot;nickname = rw01_01b&quot; pointed to a base in the Newmars system which was not included with this addon. Version 2 removes the base = lines from both those planets. If your using Ringworld in your own mod, you can manually remove those entries your self by searching for the parts in quotes above.</div>

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=505' Target=_Blank> <b>Bootstrap Mod v2.0 made by devGuy </b> </a>
<br />Who this is for: Someone who has played through the game, made tons of money, bought the biggest ship, and wants to throw that all away and start Freelancer over. Some of the most fun is the first few hours when you&#8217;re scrambling to stay alive and get a foothold.
<br />What does it do: When you start a new game, this mod will:
<br />Remove all story line missions and gate limitations. It&#8217;s like starting a MP game in SP. You have no restrictions on where to go or what to do.
<br />Shows all systems, bases, secret wrecks, jump gates and jump holes on the navigation map from the beginning before they are ever visited. One of the more frustrating things when you start a new game is the need to fly by every item before it shows up again. This mod eliminates that.
<br />Now gives you the most requested feature that was not in v.1 - shows price paid for commodities at all bases in your trading screen from the time you buy your first unit of goods.
<br />Gives you a slightly better starting ship, the Patriot. There are two level 2 guns, one level 3 gun, one each best in it&#8217;s class for graviton, positron, and molecular shields. You also get a level 2 shield in the starting loadout. This is a very basic config, so you are still going to have to play sharp to get started...but not quite as sharp.
<br />Dresses Trent in a stylish black flight suit.
<br />Cuts down the time to start your cruise engines to one second instead of the default five. This will be true for any ship in the game.
<br />Increases your cruise speed to 500 from the default 300.
<br />Doubles the speed and reach of your tractor beam. Now you can grab ALL that space loot out there.
<br />Makes mining the Copperton asteroid field in Colorado easier. You will get far more copper from each asteroid now, and don&#8217;t forget the base that pays more for copper than any other in the universe has always been right there in Colorado. This should give you a viable alternative revenue source if you would like to start out without making enemies of all the pirates.
<br />Why: The philosophy behind this mod is that the second (or third) time you play this game you want to get around a little faster, and spend a little less time on the rudimentary opening up of things. Fundamentally nothing major in the game has changed, and nothing has been added.

<br />Freelancer's Special Bretonia Prototype Heavy Fighter. 
<br />Through recent trading, Bretonia has acquired access to Kusari engine technology. Combining the new engines with salvaged and reverse engineered Corsair power supplies has produced this formidable heavy fighter. It can handle all weapons from class 1 - 10 and with 8 hardpoints and 2 disruptor/missile bays, you'll have plenty of firepower. Available for sale on Junyo and Houston.

<br />Extra jumpholes in some of the major systems.
<br />A Liberty system named New Federation which contains jumpholes to every other system.

<br />Available at Junyo &amp; Houston ship dealers.
<br />The Raven is a large and well armored very heavy fighter.
<br />It is based partly on xeno technology. The coloration makes it difficult to see in space, so it's a difficult target to hit. Dual thrusters give that extra &quot;get up and go&quot; you might want in a tight situation. It can handle all weapons from class 1 - 10 and with 8 hardpoints and 2 disruptor/missile bays, you'll have plenty of firepower.

<br />This MOD makes EVERYONE have &quot;Friendly&quot; status with you. Even the Nomads in the &quot;Easter Egg&quot; systems!
<br />Here's version 1 of my first MOD I have made, called &quot;AlPal's Everyone Loves You MOD&quot;. It's similar to Tygrys' &quot;Friendly Universe MOD&quot; as they both make every faction have &quot;Friendly&quot; status with you. They are different because in my MOD, you must do two missions for the Liberty Navy to make everyone have &quot;Friendly&quot; status with you. Just in case you are wondering, I asked Tygrys if I could launch a similar MOD, and he said it was fine with him.
<br />This MOD is in .flmod format, and you will need IGx89's Freelancer MOD Manager V.1.0 or higher to use it. NOTE: This MOD has not been tested in Multiplayer, or with other MODs. 
<br />Note: People will attack you only if you attack them first, or if you are on a mission against them. Even if you kill someone, your rep with them won't go down (actually, it will go up!).
<br />To make factions friendly to you, kill people that belong to that faction for a slight increase of &quot;friendship&quot; from their faction (and possibly others). To have EVERYBODY super-friendly with you, simply do two missions for the Liberty Navy! It's that easy!

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=486' Target=_Blank> <b>Hostile Universe v8 made by Giskard </b> </a>
<br />Introduction. Hostile Universe is mod that encourages players to explore, hang around bars, trade and shoot things. Basically everything the original Freelancer offered but in Hostile Universe I have taken the ideas further and to some degree to extremes. The huge single player battles are back, as are new bar rumors, a new story line and lots of other goodies for you to find for your self. Treasures await those who play game as it was meant to be played because Hostile Universe stays true to the original game and expands on everything that was great about Freelancer in the first place. We also have lots of new ships thrown in as a Bonus but Hostile Universe is not a ship mod. Ships form one small part of Hostile Universe and they have all be interrogated into the game. You will find nothing has simply been bolted onto Freelancer, everything has a story, a reason for being there and in some cases offers clues to other features that are waiting to be found. The reason to upgrade your ship in the original Freelancer was a strong one but Hostile Universe has introduced reasons to downgrade again because not all ships will perform all tasks as well as some available ships will. It is up to you to find out what ship is best at what job.

<br />Description: This Mod (drepanon.server.flmod) is ONLY needed on the server side. NO clients will have to load this mod!
<br />This Mod is intended for Multiplayer use ONLY.
<br />This Mod does the following:
<br />Opens all Jump gates and jump holes on the server (even unlisted ones.)
<br />Starts players with nearly complete nav map.
<br />Starts players exactly neutral will all factions.
<br />IMPORTANT!
<br />Delete all Multiplayer accounts before using this mod. (reset server)!!!
<br />The Gate &amp; Jump Hole settings are configured at the time of account creation.
<br />If you fail to remove existing accounts there is a chance that the existing accounts with locked gates still set to be locked will cause the server to revert to original settings.
<br />This can be accomplished by deleting the contents of

<br />The last in the line of very light fighters, this ship makes use of the latest available technology. The power supply is upgraded and while it isn't quite as maneuverable as the Y fighter, it can still turn faster than any ships from the four houses. The torpedo bay can also mount a missile launcher. You could mount a gun on the torpedo mount also, but it will not be very useful since the hardpoint does not rotate. The torpedo mount will not mount a class 10 weapon either. With the upgraded power supply, it can handle all weapons from class 1 - 10 and with 4 hardpoints and 1 torpedo/missile mount, you'll have plenty of firepower.
<br /><b>Stats </b>
<br />Guns/Turrets: 4/0

<br />The Level 0 mod makes the single player Rebalancing mod by Michael a bit easier. It is not intended to be used in multiplayer.
<br />The Rebalancing mod must be installed first, and then Level 0 mod (see Readme for more details.)
<br />An attempt has been made to give the player more options in the story and after.
<br />Ships and equipment have been moved around to make them accessible to the player as he/she plays through the campaign. Ship prices and loadouts vary from base to base and I have tried to offer special deals for the single player campaign.
<br />Some equipment is cheaper than in the original Rebalancing mod so that it can be more easily used in the campaign.
<br />Eight new variants of original ships, 2 new weapons, and 2 new pieces of equipment have been added:
<br />Defender Prototype 
<br />Anubus MkII
<br />Ridgerunner freighter 
<br />Order Eagle
<br />Order Titan 
<br />Order Hammerhead 
<br />Order Saber
<br />Dromedary Border Worlds Freighter 
<br />Order Thruster Mk II 
<br />Order Engine Mk II 
<br />Liberty prototype blaster
<br />Liberty prototype turret
<br />The Ridgerunner is an upgraded Clydesdale and the Bactrian is an upgraded Dromedary
<br />Xwing and Starviper Vengeance have both mine and countermeasure droppers.
<br />Upgrade engines now give shorter time to charge the cruise engine.
<br />Upgrade power supplies now give longer afterburner burns.
<br />Max speed has been set to 20000 which greatly increases trade lane speed and reduces travel time.

<br />They are dated December 9, 2002 in your &quot;Load Game&quot; list. No MOD-ing required.
<br />(Info)
<br />This is my third submission and probably a final one. After finding out that you can equip any ship with most of the available arsenal/armor, I decided that it is better to use light fighters in the game. Here, try each one of them out:
<br />Dagger (begins at level 0)
<br />Bloodhound, Piranha (make your pick); begin at level 2 
<br />Cavalier, Legionnaire, Drake, Hawk, or Banshee (begin at level 6) 
<br />Patriot, Startracker (level 10) 
<br />Starflier (level 17); kind of poetic, just like David vs Goliath
<br />As a tip, I suggest not changing ship during the campaign. But if you do, you can use flcodec.exe and a text editor to re-equip your new ship from its saved-game file. Same goes for changing weapon/shield.

<br />This patch includes all the patches that were in the Unofficial Freelancer SP patch 1.1.
<br />Minable area&#8217;s
<br />I found that some of the patches that I made to make clouds/asteroids visible on the Navmap, removed the &#8220;minable&#8221; marking on the Navmap. This patch corrects this. In the process I learned that some area&#8217;s (with the original ini files) were marked minable, but in fact they were not or just small pockets within them were minable. This patch corrects this also.
<br />In the process I also added, whenever possible, a link to the minable resource. When clicking on the ? when the cursor is over the minable area on the Navmap the resource that can be mined here will be revealed.
<br />More clouds/asteroid fields visible.
<br />Visibility clouds on Navmap. Some black clouds were hardly or not visible on the Navmap. I altered their fog_color settings slightly to make them better visible.
<br />Unknown objects. I discovered some more and repaired them.
<br />Missing reputations, whenever discovered they were repaired.
<br />Missing names on the Navmap. Added Ids_name where appropriate and whenever I could find out the correct name but they were not in the nameresource.dll, I added them in the nameresource.dll.
<br />Ithaca station now on the Navmap.
<br />Run by references. I found at least 3 run by references that were not in line with the information on the base. Repaired this.
<br />Radiation. In some systems when a combined cloud/asteroid field is involved, the radiation warning is lacking when flying in the asteroid part. But the damage is still there. Repaired the lacking warning.
<br />Hazardous area&#8217;s. Whenever possible hazardous area&#8217;s will now reveal themselves when the cursor is over them on the Navmap.
<br />No information. Some objects or area&#8217;s had no Ids-info (?). Repaired and when there is no information available from the infocards.dll, it will now display : no information available.
<br />Mine fields. Made some of the minefields to show up on the Navmaps.

<br />This ship is a large and well armored heavy fighter. It can take a pounding and can give as good as it gets. The Thunderbird was designed by an eccentric scientist who fancied himself a Freelancer. While he wasn't very successful at it, the ship is an excellent design and handles well for one so large.
<br /><b>Stats </b>
<br />Guns/Turrets: 6/2 
<br />Armor: 8000
<br />Cargo Holds: 75
<br />Max Batteries/NanoBots: 75/75

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=465' Target=_Blank> <b>Freelancer's Special Very Light Y Fighter made by Paul </b> </a>
<br />This ship is small, fast and agile. Y Fighter has the tightest turning radius of the X, Y and Z Fighters. As quick as it is, the inertial dampening system makes it very easy to handle. Even using the latest, lightweight composite armor, sacrifices had to be made, in cargo capacity and in equipment storage capacity, to make it the lightest ship of the three. Still, you should have plenty of repair and recharge available. With the best power supply available, it can handle all weapons from class 1 - 10 and with 5 hardpoints, you'll have plenty of firepower.
<br /><b>Stats </b>
<br />Armor: 4000

<br />LancerGuard is a small, server-side only anti-hack mod (players don't need to download anything).
<br />LancerGuard blocks/nullifies the following cheats:
<br />Cloak

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=456' Target=_Blank> <b>Victor&#8217;s MP Enhancement mod v1.3 made by Victor </b> </a>
<br />Victor&#8217;s MP Enhancement mod is designed to increase the difficulty level of multi-player games, give the players increased freedom and more variety in the player ships and equipment. Please note, the value of the dollar in this mod has been reduced to overcome a game limitation, most items cost nearly 50% less (commodities, equipment, ships, etc). The net effect is that ship repairs are more expensive and it is very hard to accumulate the cash needed to buy capital ships. Encounters throughout space are more unpredictable and there is more variety in the ships encountered. Overall, &#8220;good&#8221; players will find it easier to stay in the populated areas while &#8220;evil&#8221; players will find it easier in the remote systems. New York is essentially untouched, except for the addition of capital ship encounters, so it is still an easy system for new players. The mod incorporates Xerx&#8217;s &#8220;Open SP&#8221; mod, so while it is useable in SP you can&#8217;t follow the story.
<br />The &#8220;short&#8221; feature list is: (see the readme.txt for more information)
<br />Reputation is very important when trying to buy anything but ship hulls.
<br />Improved AI behavior and loadouts.
<br />Capital ship encounters in all populated systems.
<br />No more &#8220;secret&#8221; weapons in wrecks, wrecks still contain good weapons, but not unique ones, instead those guns have all been mounted in assorted AI ships, now the players need to earn them and the &#8220;race for the wrecks&#8221; is significantly less important.
<br />Balanced all ships by class essentially making all light fighters equal, all heavy fighters equal, etc. Players can now fly the ships they like rather than the ship that can hold the guns they like. Ships still have differences between them in cargo capacity, speed, handling, armor and power output.
<br />All fighters and freighters can use all of the original player ship weapon and turret classes. Yes, a Starflier can now mount DIAMONDBACK guns however it may lack the energy output to use them well.
<br />Mines, CM launchers and thruster are interchangeable, mix and match them as you see fit, even 3 of the same.
<br />Torpedoes and cruise disrupters use regular weapon mounts and the torpedo mounts can be used by regular weapons.
<br />Shields now consume power while regenerating, energy is significantly more important now.
<br />Shields require power to stay online, equal to 10 x shield class per second.
<br />All Player hitpoint bonuses reduced or removed.
<br />All AI hitpoint bonuses removed.
<br />Most of the ships in the original game can be purchased and flown by players and they can dock *almost* anywhere.
<br />2 &#8220;new&#8221; ships, Giskard&#8217;s Babylon 5 cargo ship and Lars Rinde&#8217;s Shuttle, both with shinny new &#8220;Victor&#8221; textures
<br />Ship dealers added to all shipyard bases and several other scattered bases
<br />Some equipment is more spread out through the universe
<br />Scanners are now buyable and upgrades are available (4 versions).
<br />Liberty has a few new guns to get their max weapon class up to 9.
<br />New commodity &#8220;Prisoners&#8221; available.

<br />Description:
<br />This mod will add an extremely profitable trade route between planet Primus and Gammu. You will have to take bananas (food) to the Monkeys and engine parts to the Robots.
<br />If you dare to go there in a freighter, you will be rich in a minute.
<br />If in something smaller - well, you may need 3 minutes.
<br />Could be mixed with other mods despite warnings.
<br />Designed specially to allow quick cash for the Freelancer Massive Addon, where some ships are very expensive. Can be mixed with Friendly Nomads or Friendly Universe to make this route save one.</div>

<br />very wealthy
<br />fly the best fighters (Eagle, Sabre, and Titan)
<br />fight using class 10 weapon
<br />friend with everyone
<br />have a complete Nav-map (bases, jump holes, wrecks).
<br />Installation:
<br />Just put the extracted files in your saved-games directory.
<br />My Documents \ My Games \ Freelancer
<br />They are dated November 2002 in the &quot;Load Game&quot; list. No MOD-ing required.
<br />Several notes:
<br />You can begin freelancing at Level 0. No need to &quot;talk to Juni.&quot;
<br />Even as Juni 'downgraded' your Eagle with Starflier on 1st mission, Mission1.fl file will restore your ship.
<br />All jump gates/holes are open. You can even dock at Ryuku base in Tohoku system.
<br />Eagle is replaced with Sabre starting at Level_08.fl and then replaced with Titan in Level_17.fl
<br />You can't buy the top ammo yet because the required level hasn't been reached. 50 is all you got for each.
<br />FinalGame.fl takes you to the final mission and then to the final cut-scene.
<br />After completing the campaign, you are taken all the way up to the maximum level. No &quot;Next Level Requirement&quot; anymore.
<br />Old tip: When on a base/planet, you can mount/unmount a weapon by viewing your cargo and clicking the blue box at the top-left of a weapon icon in the weapon list.

<br />Moved jumphole above base instead of below for easier docking.

<br />Just decompress the Zip file into
<br />C:\Program Files\Freelancer Mod Manager\mods directory.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=420' Target=_Blank> <b>Superdocker v1.0a1 made by Sephroth </b> </a>
<br />This is a Docking Mod that allows you to dock a Battleship with just
<br />about anything. It also works on fighters and everything else. I call it the Superdocker.
<br />It's also good with speeding up the boring docking procedure.
<br />Oh yeah launching a battleship is somewhat of a problem and somewhat not.
<br />Sure you can launch from regular stations with out a problem but from rock bases it can be a little difficult.
<br />I intend to work on the launching part so I can build the best
<br />dock/launch mod.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=414' Target=_Blank> <b>Fight Light v1 made by devGuy </b> </a>
<br />You have to fight hard when you fight light. Sure it is fun to have the uber VHF and blast everything out of the sky in one shot, but after a while you grow weary of that. In the original Freelancer there could have been more ship options in the lighter weight classes. Thus FightLight Dozen was born; a selection of 12 light and medium fighters:
<br />Awing, Dralthi, Ewing, Gargoyle, Hellcat, Hornet Jedi StarFighter,
<br />SoulStealer, Valk, Viper, Z-95, CSV
<br />You may have flown these ships in their original mods. With very few exceptions this trip into Sirius will be different. Configurations like handling, mass, class, weapons, shield, and cargo of these twelve ships have been adjusted to be consistent within this package, and within Freelancer overall. In other words, that super light fighter probably will not have a cargo hold of 100 units any more, and the ship that does will not handle like the super light in this mod.
<br />Inside the .zip file you will find a .pdf spreadsheet with full details on each ship, including where you can purchase it. There is also a screenshot of each ship included in this package.
<br />Thanks to all the talented modders who built these ships and brought
<br />them into Freelancer. They are the original creative talent, this is
<br />merely their work tweaked and repackaged. I bow in their honor.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=393' Target=_Blank> <b>Elite Ship Pack made by redeye </b> </a>
<br />This mod adds the Cobra MkIII, Krait Assault Craft, Ferdelance, Thargoid Warship and Thargon from the Elite series.
<br />All ships come in original Elite finishes by default but located in each ships directory are batch files to switch textures. You can buy a ship, save, quit, switch textures and reload no probs. Each ship has at least one alternative texture. Every ship also has a blank version of its texture file with the ships lines traced out - so it is very easy to make your own custom textures.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=391' Target=_Blank> <b>Sam's Jump System v1.1 made by Sam, aka Newt </b> </a>
<br /><b>General </b>
<br />The idea was to create a mod that could be added in top of ANY other mods. So this mod rebalance nothing, contains no dll's and all objects that you can get in the System, are from the original game (yes, the nomad weapons too).
<br />There are generally no problems to add this mod in top of other mods like &quot;flrebalance&quot; from Michael Dan, etc. The &quot;Freelancer Massive Addon&quot; mod from Tygrys contains this mod already. For modders: Feel free to add this mod in your mods. 
<br /><b>The New System </b>
<br />This mod adds a new System in the Freelancer universe. The entry to the system is in Omicron Alpha Secret. Jump from Omicron Alpha in the UnknownJumpHole (Sector F4) to the Unknown Alien Space (Omicron Alpha Secret) and there you already see the Jumpgate to the new JumpSystem (Sector B6). I place the entry here, to not effect the story. Look to the file: &quot;SamsJumpSystem.gif&quot; in the FLMM mods dir after install.
<br /><b>The Story Jumpgates </b>
<br />The system is in Nomad space and includes tradelanes to jumpgates where you can jump to the 7 &quot;story only&quot; systems. There are jumpgates back to this JumpSystem.
<br /><b>The Unknown Faction Station </b>
<br />There is a small station, where you can dock and buy the Anubis fighter, etc. The 4 room backgrounds from the station are the 4 Freelancer intros (incl. the unused secret intro &quot;waterworld&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br /><b>The Nomad Planet </b>
<br />In the new System is a Nomad planet where you can try to dock and buy Nomad weapons
<br />(do not think you become a warm welcome from the nomads ...)
<br />Nomad Prototype
<br />Nomad Blaster
<br />Nomad Cannon
<br />Nomad Laser 1
<br />Nomad Laser 2
<br />Nomad Turret
<br />Nomad Disruptor
<br />Nomad Torpedo
<br /><b>The Nomad Lair and Nomad City </b>
<br />In the middle of the system is a Nomad Lair where you can &quot;dock&quot; and jump to a secret place in the system, a Nomad city. There's a treasure (wrack) in range of the city.
<br /><b>The &quot;Nomad Laser 3&quot; Secret </b>
<br />I've heard rumors from a powerful nomad weapon, called &quot;Nomad Laser 3&quot;. A old pilot from the unknown faction told me that there is a &quot;Alien Jumpgate&quot; in range of the Nomad Planet.
<br />He says:
<br />&quot;If you jump in, you see nothing except nomads, but if you try to jump back, the jumphole(s) play ping-pong with you. If you open your eyes, you'll find a Nomad wrack in the last area before you jump back to the start jumpgate.&quot;
<br />He says it was to hard for him to salvage the wrack, but he could see it and a very powerful Nomad weapon.
<br />I think if I've a better ship and I'm a good enough pilot, I'll try to find this oddity weapon.
<br /><b>The Enemies </b>
<br />You'll fight against Nomad Fighters, Nomad Gunboats, Nomad Battleships and a defender (MSN11, the fighter with the Nomad prototype weapons) who protect the Nomad Lair. The Nomads Lair defends with 12 turrets.</div>

<br />Mining Operations V1.0
<br />This mod basically makes it a lot more likely that when you shoot an asteroid some commodity will come out of it. This is so it is actually viable to be a miner, as you can earn just as much as any other way now. I have also tried to make the harder to reach mining locations a lot more rewarding than the easy to reach ones.
<br />i.e., An Ice Cloud in the Omicron Beta system will have a lot more water in each asteroid than one in the New York System.

<br />As I suspect it is mainly people who mod that will be annoyed by this it doesn't remove the 3 starting movies before the menu 'cause this would have made it incompatible with most mods in FLMM.

<br />This mod turns off all the ship board headlights, docking lights, running lights and space station lights in Freelancer. Whats the point in that??? Well, I play Freelancer using a pair of eDimensional 3d glasses and the glow from these lights appears on the screen positioned directly on the screen and not on the ship (those who have seen Freelancer in 3d will know what i mean). This is very confusing and if the lights displayed are large enough makes it hard to focus on the action. So this mod simply turns off all the lights, both on the piloted ships and on all the other objects.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=354' Target=_Blank> <b>Shaw Fujikawa Translight Engine Mod made by Wassup1444465 </b> </a>
<br />Finally something to bring the boredom out of the singleplayer campaign. You guys at TLR might like this for whenever you are finally able to get a break and play the game a bit...
<br />Description on a totally different type of mod...
<br />First off, any of you read the halo books and/or played the halo game?
<br />Remember the shaw-fujikawa slipspace jumps. The ones that are highly
<br />inaccurate for the humans, and although you travel at light speed, you might wind up far from your intended destination? And how lethal it could be to do an in-system jump? Wait till you see this.
<br />For those of you who have not read the books and/or don't always do
<br />multiplayer, do you ever get bored after singleplayer because of the length of time it takes to travel, and all those trade lane hacks...
<br />Well, for both categories, do i have the mod for you! (file size under 1 kilobyte!) Introducing the shaw-fujikawa translight engine mod! What you do is you create a waypoint to wherever you want to go. I suggest putting it a tad bit in front of the target (meaning a bit more in between you and the target than rather the target destination itself.) so that your deceleration time wont cause you to hit a darn object. Then, hit the go to button, and your done. Depending on distance, you should arrive there almost instantly. This allows fast, easy travel in a system such as say Manhattan.
<br />Sure, a lot of cargo ships and AI players wind up hitting planets and stuff.
<br />I suggest NOT using this in asteroid fields, for your own safety. Also, when you are on missions, start to decelerate maybe 6 clicks before a waypoint, and thruster the rest of the way so that you don't pass your target.
<br />And thank goodness this mod isn't abusable in multiplayer.
<br />And one more thing, in case you want to avoid obstacles, I suggest going into turret view when you hit the cruise engines.
<br />Also, this is untested in the singleplayer campaign, but do to the fact that you often go through ice fields and the like, i suggest uninstalling it for singleplayer missions and reinstalling it for between missions when your trading or doing random missions.
<br />Sorry about the length of my recent mod descriptions. Seems there is really no shorter way to describe it.

<br />Due to complaints about tradelanes not working and people not being able to find the jump holes and the base. I did a rebuild on the mod with a newer version of the tool I use, which should solve the tradelane problem. I've changed the location of the jumpholes to the GAW System so their further from the bases, so I can place tradelanes to them from the key bases. I've also made a new system on the other side of the GAW system called tradesystem containing a base selling alien-organism for 1$ and a base buying alien-organism for 9999$ and a depot center with all the commodities.
<br />2.00 I added 157 trade lanes from the GAWJH to the key bases in the sectors.
<br />Added a renewed ship market base with more room and place for ships plugins, which isn't finished yet.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=310' Target=_Blank> <b>Level 10 Gun mod v1.2 made by Just Some Guy aka rdr99 </b> </a>
<br />Included are some level 10 guns available at Planet Manhattan for regular cannon and turret, and Detroit Munitions for pulse cannon and turret using a variation of Alex Schultz's &quot;weapon engine mod&quot;. I have made the following changes:
<br />1. The justice mark2 cannon now fires slower than his but has more power per hit. His was 50/50 hull and shield damage @ 500 pulses/sec. I have also increased the range to 932m at 800m/sec. In this upload I have three files with the same power output per/second but varied by 8, 4, and 2 pulses per/sec. Thus they have 270/270 @ 8.33per/sec, 562/562 @ 4per/sec, and finally 1124/1124 @ 2per/sec. I find for me that the 2 pulse per second works best. It seems to stop the fights quicker than the others because I need only be on target once and its over!
<br />2. There is a pulse cannon and turret set available at Detroit Munitions as well... see the readme file for details.
<br />3. The excellent Eraser missile that Alex modified to be like a plasma missile is now faster.
<br />4. All scroungeable level 10 cannon except for the Nomad weapons now match the speed and range of my modified cannon (800m/sec, range 932m) so they can be used in a set if you wish and still have the same point of aim.
