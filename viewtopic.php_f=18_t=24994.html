			<div class="content">You don't have a problem with SS or TNG, you have a problem with the people who made it, lets get that straight right now.  YOUR BEEF IS WITH ME, <b>ME   </b>, NOT ANY OTHER PERSON.  DO NOT FLAME ANY OTHER PERSON AFFILIATED WITH STARFYRE STUDIOS.
<br />
<br />People are accusing us of doing the following, I want to make this clear:
<br />
<br /><b>a: Trying to copyright our material.   </b>
<br />
<br />We can protect what is not created by microsoft. That includes ships, artwork, and anything NON-MS related.  I'm not even going to bother with the code anymore, I could give a rats ass.
<br />
<br />WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES TRYING TO PROTECT OUR WORK, YOU FLAME US FOR TRYING, YET YOU DON'T FLAME OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO THE SAME THING.  WHY?
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>b: Trying to become a registered company.   </b>
<br />
<br />WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE WENT TO MAKE OURSELVES OFFICIAL, WHY ARE WE THE ONLY ONES GETTING FLAMED FOR DOING SO?  I DON'T SEE ANYONE FLAMING ANY OTHERS, EXAMPLE: FROST-WORKS
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>c: Changing the version number so it is not useable by the original freelancer.   </b>
<br />
<br />We did this so that people playing the original game would not use TNG servers and crash horribly.  Only those with the correct version of TNG can play on TNG servers.  Is that bad?  
<br />
<br /><b>We are also not the only ones to do this, so if you blame us for this you MUST also blame the others who do this, otherwise IT IS DISCRIMINATION   </b>
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>d: Selling merchandise and making money off TNG   </b>
<br />
<br />WE DID NOT EVER SELL ANY MERCHANDISE. That was NOT MY COMPANY that made the merchandise, that was <a href='http://www.gamesthing.com' Target=_Blank>http://www.gamesthing.com/</a>
<br />
<br />WE DID NOT RUN THAT COMPANY. WE ALSO NEVER SAW ANY MONEY ON SALES THAT WERE MADE, THAT COMPANY ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN IT'S STORE.
<br />
<br />WE DON'T COLLECT ANY DONATIONS AND WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY MONEY FROM ANYONE FOR TNG.
<br />
<br />I am NOT complaining about hosting fees, HOWEVER, it is a important POINT.  We ACTUALLY PAY for people to use our mod and don't get any money in return.  How many of you other modders have spent <b>$1000+   </b> on hosting fees?  If you have, then you know how hard it is to recap funds.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>e: Copying from other mods   </b>
<br />
<br />I want to make this very clear to certain people who like to twist stuff around for their own gain to make people look bad.
<br />
<br /><b>FIRST   </b> I would like to point out some history to those that have recently came to lancer and know nothing about the modding history.  Also for those who like to jump to conclusions without even bothering to check their facts and making an ass of themselves for making assumptions.
<br />
<br />Many of you may not remeber, but REYNENMOD came out in <b>March/April   </b> with many of the features you see in other mods today.  REYNENMOD was the first major mod for freelancer offering this type of material. 
<br />
<br />1: Player capital ships (battleships, cruisers, gunboats).  I am not saying we were the first to come up with the <b>IDEA (Credit goes to wanderer for the first semi-creation of the liberty battleship)   </b> HOWEVER Reynenmod was the first mod to incorperate all house captial ships and make them flyable by players.  The rest of the mods copied this idea from reynenmod and I have no problems with that.
<br />
<br />2: Ship upgrades - We had the first concept and workable upgrades.  REBALANCEMOD (which was based on reynenmod with given permission, later created many others, which in turn were given to TNG to use)
<br />
<br />3: Beam weapons - We had the first versions of the Freespace 2 beam style weapons which were requested for capital ships, which extended to player ships weapons.
<br />
<br />4: Changing the starting flash page. - The artwork displayed by Spawn was the first of it's kind to be used in a mod.
<br />
<br />5: Docking rings for stations for capital ships were also FIRST developed and put into play in REYNENMOD.  Later on in TNG, DURIEL created the FIRST METHOD where CAPITAL SHIPS COULD DOCK WITHOUT THE HELP OF DOCKING RINGS WHILE MAINTAINING THE DOCKING CINEMATICS. This was not possible before this came about.
<br />
<br />6: Later on in TNG, BOBTHEDOG created the first change to the intro cinematics that people see.  He also added faction based guns (House guns).
<br />
<br /><b>THERE WERE NUMBEROUS OTHER THINGS ADDED AND CHANGED AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE ORIGINAL REYNENMOD 1.6 FILES.   </b>
<br />
<br />Now with the devlopment of TNG, many people contributed to it and we gave them credit in the readme.  WE WILL NO LONGER GIVE ANY CREDIT TO ANYONE IN THE README SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE A LIABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANY MOD.   (I wish to thank Giskard who made this clear to all of us)
<br />
<br />So in the future, do not blame us for not putting any credit toward contributers because apparently the mod makers do not wished to be named in the event of a legal dispute.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>F: Encrypting our code and not sharing our code with anyone   </b>
<br />
<br />1: Yes we did encrypt our code to prevent people from cheating.  Is that a bad thing?  People who cheat in SP OFTEN cheat in MP since it is the same cheat.
<br />
<br />2: OUR FILES ARE SEPERATE FROM THE FREELANCER FILES CREATED.  You can find the stuff for TNG in the TNG folder.
<br />
<br />3: ALL other mods that contributed to TNG make it clear that THERE WAS CERTAIN MATERIAL THEY DID NOT WANT COPIED.  We respected that.
<br />
<br /><b> So why do we get flamed for wanting to keep certain features unique to TNG when others have asked the same thing from the modding community?  I don't see anyone flaming giskard for him not letting people use his special systems, nor at michael dan who does not to share certain features in rebalance mod.  What about the ships for new universe, they are not going to share those.  WHY IS TNG BEING SINGLED OUT?   </b>
<br />
<br />4: We ARE WILLING TO SHARE what we have created so long as we get credit for it.  Certain people have blantly said THEY WILL NOT GIVE US CREDIT AND USE IT ANYWAY.  <b>THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WE WANTED TO PROTECT OUR STUFF   </b>
<br />
<br />5: I have recently found out some people have stolen our models and our claiming then as their own.  Here are SOME examples of the models spawn has created himself.  (THIS IS NOT A FULL COMPILATION)
<br />
<br />Tempest
<br /><img src='http://www.starfyrestudios.com/Ships/Tempestsm.jpg   '>
<br />
<br />Hammerhead
<br /><img src='http://www.starfyrestudios.com/Ships/Hammerheadsm.jpg   '>
<br />
<br />Shivan Capship
<br /><img src='http://www.starfyrestudios.com/Ships/Shivansm.jpg   '>
<br />
<br />Ascendent
<br /><img src='http://www.starfyrestudios.com/Ships/Acdsm.jpg   '>
<br />
<br />Bab5 Capship
<br /><img src='http://www.starfyrestudios.com/Ships/Bab5capsm.jpg   '>
<br />
<br />So in closing:  If you have a problem with me personally then lets get it out in the open and deal with it.

			<h3><a href="#p208190" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I wanted to address the following people and get this out in the open and done and dealt with.  Since these people obviouslyh ave a problem, lets settle it.
<br />
<br />CHIPS - You obviously think that what people create first doesn't matter.  Most people would disagree with you.  Something can only be created once, then the rest are copies.  Also in one of locked posts you accuse reynenmod of NOT coming out with stuff first, YET YOU FAIL TO SUBMIT PROOF OF WHO CAME OUT WITH IT FIRST AND THE DATE IT CAME OUT.
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />DOWNWINF_THEIF
<br />
<br />If you took one second to consider what you have done to everyone who has kindly helped or upported your mod you would have added a big disclaimer saying that they do not have any connection to Starfyre other than that they contributed modified code freely. You mention there was a disclaimer, it obviously didn't point out many things when read or else MS would have left the brilliant modders of this community alone.... 
<br />
<br />So you are saying this ONLY applies to us?  I don't see other modders doing this.  Is this in rebalance mod, rebalance mod, or ANY OTHER MOD for that matter?  If so please show it to me.  I'm sure AFTER THIS it will be, but as of right now they don't have it.  Also how was I suppose to know MS would go after people in the readme, am I NOT suppose to give credit to people?
<br />
<br />Would you react the same to any other mod, or is this just personal spite against me.
<br />
<br />The fact that you are labelling other people to effectively take them down with you shows that you MUST have been doing wrong to turn your back on an entire community because of what MS has done completely unrelated to the community other than being the owner of said software... 
<br />
<br />Who am I labelling to take them down.  People accuse us of doing stuff and I am pointed to people who have already done it.  People never flamed them about it, so why are they flaming others.  Are we to be held to double standards then the rest of the modding community?
<br />
<br />Like so many people have said, best thing for Starfyre to do is wipe the tears from their eyes, stop all their copyright nonsense and defending of their actions and plead forgiveness. If it doesn't save you, you might have gotten MS off the backs of the others you pulled into this like the selfish children you, mainly Reynen, are acting like....
<br />
<br />You should also stop squeeling about Reynenmod, it may have been the first major mod but you never tried to copyright it so stop comparing them to each other. You say you didn't have anything to do with the store selling merchandise but if you indeed took materials without permission you prolly did but deny it. The biggest thing about TNG was that you essentially REMOVED their game from its own world and placed in your own. My advice try to start your own game developer and make your own space game with TNG in mind... keep everything original and who knows, maybe MS will buy you and get you onto bigger and better things? 
<br />
<br />1: I take a HUGE offense to this statement here. <b>You say you didn't have anything to do with the store selling merchandise but if you indeed took materials without permission you prolly did but deny it.     </b>
<br />
<br />That is borderline libel right there.  You are DIRECTLY accusing us of conspiracy, illegal merchandising, and selling copyrighted material.  We were aware the company was selling that HOWEVER, that was NOT OUT COMPANY, and we DID NOT RECEIVE ANY MONEY.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT OTHER COMPANIES DO.
<br />
<br />The only reason I mentioned reynenmod was because people said we were copying other mods when we actually came up with the stuff.  When people are accused of copying they often provide proof of their original creations yes?
<br />
<br />If some company claimed they had an OS before WIN 95, and that WIN95 was a copy of their OS, Microsoft would break out windows 3.1 as proof of concept would they not.
<br />
<br />As far as your statement here, <b>The biggest thing about TNG was that you essentially REMOVED their game from its own world and placed in your own.    </b>
<br />
<br />And we are the only one to do this?  This would also apply to Rebalance mod, Hostile Universe, Grrsk Mod, Starwars mod, and soon to be NEW UNIVERSE along with ANY OTHER MOD.  I fail to see your reasoning, or are you saying the others are exempt and this only applies to us?
<br />
<br />
<br />Lastly <b>My advice try to start your own game developer and make your own space game with TNG in mind... keep everything original and who knows, maybe MS will buy you and get you onto bigger and better things    </b>
<br />
<br />Microsft already patented their game engine, anyone who comes up with ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO FREELANCER will be sued out of existance.
<br />MS will do anything to keep the compeition at bay and NO STARTUP SOFTWARE COMPANY CAN DEFEND THIERSELVED IN A PROTRACTED LEGAL BATTLE ADN WHEN THEY WITHDRAW BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS, MS AUTOMATICALLY WINS.
<br />
<br /><b>JUSTICE IN AMERICA IS DETERMINED BY HOW MUCH YOU HAVE FOR LEGAL FEES AND HOW LONG YOU CAN STAY IN COURT, THE LAST ONE THERE WINS   </b>

			<h3><a href="#p208226" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Okay - i posted an apology. You yourself have stated above that yours was the first mod to contain all capships, not make them flyable. My beef was that you were in effect going to try to gain a strangle hold on the community with your 'COPYRIGHT' stuff.
<br />
<br />Here - now i am annoyed again - i will spell it out. Please finish reading (its long) before typing a reply....what you first read is explained further down!
<br />
<br />You were going to copyright the fact that putting all capships in a mod was only your perogative, and that if others wished too they would have to ask for permission and give you credit? Is that what you are stating now that your Reynen mod was the first to come in with that? Sounds like it..
<br />
<br /> Utter........well - put best - one of YOUR OWN TEAM stated that if someone made/found out how to do something first, and then someone else busted their ass to work it out, then at that point they don't have to give credit due to figuring this out. My point- hell - i made all capships flyable by myself from looking at the files and finding what was different. Then days of fiddling yielded the results. Many other modders also manage to do this, but you wish to make us all pay homage or something? Forget it.
<br />
<br />2. You now have stated that you created the capship beam  weapons - i still don't see YOUR name on the mod for beam weapons which was available ages ago....
<br />I think we are talking about different beams here....(ie - you = capship, me = first beam weapon mod made available)
<br />
<br />3. docking - The method you use right now comes from Wanderer if i am not mistaken, with the use of JUMPS - well, i read that post from Duriel about using Berths, but figured it out myself after that and the fiasco about then being able to dock anywhere. I am more than happy, and have done in my posts, to point out wanderers discovery there. Cinematics are in the game depending on a few lines you put in. Its not that you guys made anything new there. 
<br />
<br />Now there are many other mods inside TNG, and by copyrighting your TNG mod as a whole you could have strangled off the community from many mods. You weren't saying what you were copyrighting at all - in fact, i like everyone else had no idea, and the first we would have known was when you were attacking us all with threats about it.
<br />
<br /> Further more. I have said it once, here it comes again. Lancers reactor only seems to hear from you every now and then.......and the 'then' is when all of you descend to flame about someone stealing your ideas. Towards the modding community you (TNG collective) seem to show a egotisical idea that you are the only people capable with coming up with ideas.
<br />
<br />      You learnt stuff here from others.......but you then refuse to share anything new with newer members. Instead you come and moan about people 'lifting' stuff from your mods. Well - lets hear it then........what exactly do you say the steal? New weapons? anyone can make them - check out thread dates and authors yourself. New ships - anyone can put them in if they have models. converting ships? We can all do that. New mountable equipment? Anyone can put them in too - its easy to figure out. You seem to think that if anyone thinks of these very simple and basic ideas, that they are stealing from you?! Not correct.
<br />I have built a mod of considerable size now, and never looked in any ini files for other mods. I learnt, through tutorials, but MAINLY through trial and error, with a heck of alot of experimentation.
<br />
<br />I think i said it best when i said............Most modders like to take info with one hand, and give back wiht another. 
<br />
<br />You and your team however, have shown in recent months that you like to take with one, and give the finger from the other. 
<br />
<br />            You guys include everyone elses work in the way of ships, but you don't want to share anything back with the community. Why else would you not contribute, and then hide your ini file entries from other modders out of fear of lifting. I can safely say that the mod i am making will be a first at least. Everything is documented in the ini files - highlighted with descriptions etc 
<br />
<br />Perhaps I wouldn't be so rude if you didn't jump on anyone with the 'your stealing ideas' all the time, but instead wrote some tutorials and then said at the top 'please credit me' - otherwise we could all claim ideas. Like many building mods, i experiment with things, work out how to do them, then implement them in my mod. However, from the sound of what you guys were trying to do, you wanted to copyright ideas left right and center which then you would attempt to preserve as your very own. this would severly damage anyones mod - where would yours be if others had done this from the first mod made? Not far i tell you.
<br />
<br />For the last time - Frost Works can and will copyright their ships, which they might wish to keep to themselves. however, they also don't attack other modders about 'theft' at every opportunity. That was my whole problem with TNG  - you curse Microsoft from stopping you, saying its unfair, but from spectator position,and witnessing your behaviour in the past, you were going to gain a strangle on the rest of us whilst trying to boost your ego that you are the premiere modder in the world of freelancer. Effectively, you wished to  do exactly as Microsoft are now correctly doing to you.............
<br />
<br /> Personally - i don't care anymore. I will do what i have always done. Try to build my mod, find out everything that i can, and at the same time teach anyone else who asks how to do whatever they want to do/acheive and share any developments/ideas that i have. However, you never noticed what i do as i wasn't stealing your ideas of course........
<br />
<br />This is so long, i forgot where i started, but am sure i covered it all.

<br />HOW IS TNG AGAINST SHARING?  I have told people they could use what we create AS LONG AS THEY GIVE CREDIT.  Some people refuse to do so. Those that do I have a problem with them using our stuff since they tend to claim it as their own.

<br />We'll it's certainly clear you have never worked for months on something and then had someone steal it, then claim it as their own now have you.  People who steal your work often try and profit from it.

<br />
<br />Chips
<br />
<br />Thank you for the apology, but actually Reynenmod was the first mod to make all the battleships, cruisers, and gunboats flyable.
<br />
<br />The ONLY stranglehold I wanted was that I would be able to force the people who steal our stuff to give us credit for what we created and not claim it for themselves.
<br />
<br />Now onto your points...
<br />
<br /><b><i>Utter........well - put best - one of YOUR OWN TEAM stated that if someone made/found out how to do something first, and then someone else busted their ass to work it out, then at that point they don't have to give credit due to figuring this out.

Many other modders also manage to do this, but you wish to make us all pay homage or something? Forget it.  </i> </b>
<br />
<br />I love playing with people's logic it's so fun.  So lets use the following situation.
<br />
<br />1: Microsoft windows 95 is already out for awhile.
<br />2: Someone creates a duplicate windows 95 all on their own.
<br />3: While creating the new os the actual windows 95 os was out there, there is a possibiliy that they can look at it, take it apart and use it to create thier own program, yes?
<br />
<br />Since W95 is already out there the maker of the new os has a TEMPLATE to work off of that was already created.  IT THEREFORE IS A COPY.
<br />
<br />Lets look at your situation now:
<br />
<br />1: Are you telling me YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OR SEEN OF THE IDEA OF CAPITAL SHIPS BEING USED BY PLAYERS IN ANY OTHER MOD BEFORE.
<br />
<br />You youself said you knew of TNG in august, THAT QUALIFIES AS PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF A WORKING TEMPLATE TO BASE YOUR CREATION OF OFF.
<br />
<br />The ONLY way what you said would apply would be if you have NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE of what you were trying to create.  That is what the term ORIGINAL CREATION stands for, THE FIRST ONE IN EXISTANCE.
<br />
<br />So to answer your question, YES, since we developed the first flyable cap ships that PEOPLE LEARNED HOW TO DO IT BY COPYING WHAT WE DID.  I would liek to see a simple credit like, 
<br />
<br /><b>&quot;Flyable capital ships based of the original creation by reynenmod, (or TNG is you copied it from that.)&quot;  </b>
<br />
<br />I don't think thats too much to ask now is it.  It's the people like yourself who REFUSE TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE that really piss me off.  I BET YOU WOULD CLAIM YOU CREATED THOSE CAP SHIPS YOURSELF NOW WOULDN'T YOU.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b><i>You now have stated that you created the capship beam weapons - i still don't see YOUR name on the mod for beam weapons which was available ages ago.... I think we are talking about different beams here....(ie - you = capship, me = first beam weapon mod made available)  </i>  </b>
<br />
<br />We created CAP BEAM WEAPONS and REGULAR BEAM WEAPONS FOR FIGHTERS in reynenmod.
<br />
<br />The beam mod came after reynenmod therefore the creator already have prior knowledge that it had been done.
<br />
<br /><b>THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUST AN IDEA AND MAKING THE IDEA A REALITY.
<br />
<br />Look at history.  Someone else actually gave edison the idea of the incandecent lightbulb, but he actually created it.  Who is actually credited with creating it?  Thomas Edison.  </b>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b><i>3. docking - The method you use right now comes from Wanderer if i am not mistaken, with the use of JUMPS - well, i read that post from Duriel about using Berths, but figured it out myself after that and the fiasco about then being able to dock anywhere.

Its not that you guys made anything new there.   </i>  </b>
<br />
<br />Actually it uses something different.  We had to MODIFY THE HARDPOINTS ON STATIONS, IN ORDER TO GET OUR STUFF TO WORK.  You find out the facts before just assuming stuff.
<br />
<br />Wanderer - Created the first ability for cap ships to dock, though major problems, CAPITAL SHIPS GOT STUCK IN DOCKING CINEMATIC MODE AND FRELANCER FROZE.
<br />
<br />Reynenmod - Station Docking rings were added to to fix wanderers problems.
<br />
<br />TNG - Capital ships can dock WITHOUT freezing at the docking cinematic scene, station docking rings were removed.
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b><i>Now there are many other mods inside TNG, and by copyrighting your TNG mod as a whole you could have strangled off the community from many mods.

<br />
<br />Ok I am going to be blunt here cause I can't belive you said this.  ARE YOU BLIND OR JUST PLAIN STUPID?  I already have listed what I planed to copyright in many other posts, I WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT COPYRIGHT THE ENTIRE MOD.  END OF DISCUSSION THERE
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b><i>You learnt stuff here from others.......but you then refuse to share anything new with newer members. Instead you come and moan about people 'lifting' stuff from your mods.

<br />
<br />Well then following your logic I think i'll just copy all the stuff you create from now since it deosnt matter who creates it first.  Any ideas you come up with I will be sure put them in game before you, oh and claim I created it.
<br />
<br />Of course this won't bother you, right?
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b><i>I have built a mod of considerable size now, and never looked in any ini files for other mods. I learnt, through tutorials, but MAINLY through trial and error, with a heck of alot of experimentation.  </i> </b>
<br />
<br /><b>AHHHH now we have hit something substantial!!!!  From the sound of it, it seems YOU FEEL YOU HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON WHAT YOU CREATED.  Or am I mistaken.  Now if you can imagine it, HOW DID YOU THIK I FELT WHEN I CREATED REYNENMOD???  </b>
<br />
<br />There were no mods to go off of and tutorials were VERY limited.  I have written several myself since then.  I worked very hard to create that.
<br />
<br />Now how would YOU feel if someone just took all your hard work and put it into there mod WITHOUT EVEN ASKING YOU, and CLAIMED THEY CREATED IT.  Knowing that you spent MANY MANY hours developing that, how would you feel. to seen someone just steal it and claim it as their own in just a few hours?
<br />
<br />See where I am coming from now?  Most people don't until it happens to them.
<br />
<br /><b>Do you know what it is like to see a person die in front of you after you kill them?  Most people don't until it happens.  For the rest they can only imagine, because they don't KNOW.
<br />
<br />A bit morbid above but it demonstrates my point. </b>
<br />
<br />I'm tired now, I'm not even going to bother with the rest.

			<div class="content">I can't be bothered Reynen - i don't care. 
<br />
<br />Also - my ego doesn't rest on convincing others that i am great, or belittleing others about how great i am.
<br />
<br />And lastly - bout the appology, i felt bad, then read here once again that it sounded like you guys were trying to copyright all the mods ideas rather than just a few points (ie - that we couldn't use capships etc etc that we modded ourselves without your permission!). That got me worked up again - but like i said, i don't care anymore. Say what you like, people can say/threaten what they like, i don't care anymore.

<br />
<br />Oh - just to clarify, that no-one else can make more of their own house weapons cause you claim it, or weapons in general,no-one else can make more than one capship flyable cause you did it, no-one else can dock cause you did it(people - just put phantom_physics = true below the object entry in the solararch.ini file for docking rings to get round REYNENS docking ring fix - you can fly through no probs) unless you are claiming the increase in distance to docking instead, but no chance there - oh, by the way, that works for any object, your ship, weapons, stations, asteroids.........easiest way - in every entry for your ship in the shiparch.ini file - including collision boxes (not the simples though) and you will fly through anything at all - helps with docking. Where were we, oh - no beam weapons, no new ships, no new mountable items either as you cliam all that too........what else are you going to say we cannot use without your permission, cause i didn't even know of any other modding activites when i found out most of my modding stuff. I never heard of TNG till August!

			<div class="content">&quot;As far as your statement here, The biggest thing about TNG was that you essentially REMOVED their game from its own world and placed in your own.&quot;
<br />
<br />New Universe actually takes place in the normal FL systems, utilizes normal FL ships, items, and commodities, though they have also added new things.
<br />As for your comments regarding &quot;Most people who cheat in SP will cheat in MP&quot;, I don't think thats true at all. Like many other people here, I have two copies of Freelancer installed on my computer - One 'pure' version, which I use for multiplayer, and one modded version, which I use for SP, and LAN games.
<br />Oh, and please try to cut down on the caps, reading stuff like &quot;REYNEN MOD PWNS YOU AND IS OLDER THAN [insert name of random mod MOD&quot; is kinda annoying.</div>

			<div class="content">What is this? I thought this is the best fan site but now seems modders turn on each other cuz they created alot of cool stuff?
<br />
<br />Look at this way, we worked hard to &quot;create&quot; mod. Why? Simple, we like game and we want have fun with it. Now don't get me wrong. What we created certainly are not softwares and don't get mad about copyright issue. We MODIFY files. Yes ppl created their own ini and cmps but still, where the original idea come from? Isn't it from DA's original files? So let's forget about this copyright and credits or not stuff. All we are looking for is a fun game. Modders are working hard and certainly have done a great job. Don't forget it is because everybody put their thoughts and ideas together here and share. Now if some ppl working harder than others and want take credits of their work, fine. But just remember don't get into copyright issue because 90% of the players out there don't care. As long as they have fun they are ok, maybe someday they will come back and give thanks to these who created the mod but it's not always such. 
<br />
<br />Ok, there are &quot;mod stealing&quot; or &quot;model stealing&quot; problem. Come on guys, everything is for share and we never know if somebody come up with an better idea and greatly improve mods. I have never claim any idea or mods or anything belong to me just because all my works are based on other's ideas, works and comments. Nobody on this site can work alone and achive what we have today. 
<br />Reynen if you want get glory from your work that's fine with me. I do like your first mods cuz most of my works are based on it. But you can't get all the glory simply because this is a community, everybody share and enjoy mods. If you are having problem with ppl using your mods and say they created it. Simple, do what I did: keep it to myself.  I made 2 systems and some funny weapons, and put them in Single player just for myself because most of my mods considered as cheats online. Let's get over it, it's a game. We mod it cuz we want have fun with it.

			<div class="content">Okay Reynen - personally i don't give a monkeys anymore - like i said. i changed it cause i think your viens will pop with anger/ pathetic inciteful abusive comments that you have been making........i don't want your friends to try and prosecute me for murder as well as everyone else for 'taking' stuff from your mods. By doing that in your post above, and changing it to caps just shows how childish you are being about the whole issue. Put your rattle down, step back and repeat:
<br />
<br />I got myself into this mess.
<br />Others are angry because i am trying to get every modder into poo poo at the same time.
<br />
<br />I added a peaceful question to the bottom of the thread about the prison liner. I think that if you can answer that, then I am sorted - i have finished with my piece. From your answers to your rants, one thing has shined through all the time. Your arrogance. I think it might stem from the fact that some of the TNG fans address posts to you as 
<br />' Reynen the mighty modding god of all Freelanceer blah blah blah' i am not sure what exactly they put - but its words to that effect. Who cares.
<br />
<br />Anyway - your compatriot posted alot of excellent quotes in the Starfyre forum - so i would like to add my own - although i cannot remember who said it:
<br />
<br />' Its time to put up, and shut up '</div>

			<div class="content">This is not a flame.
<br />
<br />The reason I did the above all in caps is fairly simple.
<br />
<br />1: it makes it easy to read and there can be no mistaking what is said.
<br />2: the caps are also meant to give it a legal / type finality to it.  More pshcology based then anything else.
<br />
<br />Lastly you guys do realize that I have not been angry in alot of this stuff and purposely made my statements the way they are so that it would get people riled up and thinking about what is going on, and then later on when they are cooled down will think logically about it - re-read my posts - and see the logic if it.
<br />
<br />Think about it, what gets you upset generally stays on your mind alot longer then something that you like because of the sense of injustice.  Natural reaction.
<br />
<br />There is no better crowd to manipulate then gamers on a common cause because they all get single minded and are rattled easily.  I rather enjoyed it for a bit, now I'm a bit bored and tired and think I will let the dust settle so people can re-examing everything.
<br />
<br />I'm sure many of you are feeling a bit confused / shocked /  and especially angry, but that is exactly what I want you to be.  So it worked out rather well.
<br />
<br />Sorry to do this but I think at this point I've seperated the people who really don't care and the peopel who do care about what happens.  People's true natures were also exposed, some of which I was very sad about....but...you have to expect the unexpected.
<br />
<br />Like they say, your true friends stay to help fight the fire, the rest run.
<br />
<br />To set the record straight, the manipulation was aimed at finding out where the modding community stood.  We needed to know if we were going to fight it.
<br />
<br />Would you go to court if you knew only 2% of the people were supporting you.  At this point we have very little support both in terms of people and money.
<br />
<br />We would not and could not fight this.
<br />
<br />I'll not be argueing anymore.  And I'll answer your question the best way i can Chips on the other thread.
<br />
<br />Now once everyone calms down can we think of a solution on how to solve this current situation?
