			<div class="content">Before I turn on the rant tags, I'd like to state that I've been a frequent visitor to Lancer's Reactor and I'd like to thank the guys who keep the site and forums running.  Keep up the great work guys. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_clown.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />&lt;rant&gt;
<br />
<br />  First off, I&#8217;m posting this in the hopes that the developers will read it, regardless of being censored.  Yes, this issue has been hashed over multiple times, but change only happens when enough voices speak out.
<br />
<br />  I am very displeased with the lack of &#8220;proper&#8221; controller support in Freelancer.  I have a Saitek X45 stick and throttle system.  With that system I can map 256 functions and never have to fumble with the keyboard.  It&#8217;s also a very ergonomic and comfortable design to use over long periods of game play.  As with real flying, speed is life, and the faster you are at the controls, the better you can do.  Hence the reason fighter pilots have full hands-on stick and throttle systems.  It&#8217;s tried, tested and proven.  As the saying goes&#8230; if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it!
<br />
<br />  I did try Freelancer on a friend&#8217;s machine, and after 4 missions it was just as much a pain and disappointment on the last mission as it was for the first.  It really is &#8220;Privateer for Dummies.&#8221;  If you have no flying and dog fighting skills, I can see you liking it.  Those who do have skill though, I can see you hating it.  You don&#8217;t have to think, you don&#8217;t have to work.  Freelancer is the dumbing down of space sims.
<br />
<br />  Health.  A stick and throttle system is nowhere near as repetitive motion debilitating as a mouse is.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is almost entirely related to the repetitive use of MICE, and of course keyboards as well.  Repetitive use of joysticks and gamepads tends to see fewer overall injuries, as recorded by medical professionals.  To quote a great article on reducing repetitive stress injuries in Gamespy.com; &#8220;Using a controller instead of the mouse and keyboard is already a step in the right direction because it allows for more space between the TV / monitor and the eyes, and for a more relaxed sitting position.&#8221;   Thanks DA for promoting bad health. ;o)
<br />
<br />  Finally, I&#8217;m very disappointed in the gamers who knock those who do like to use a stick.  If you like the mouse, that&#8217;s fine.  I (and many others) do not.  I respect your decision (bad health choice or not), why isn&#8217;t ours being respected?  Why is the choice not there?  It&#8217;s been pretty obvious that there are those who are very upset when you count the number of threads that have been quashed already.  They want to be able to enjoy the product the way they enjoyed Privateer&#8230; a game that Freelancer is supposed to be like, yet doesn&#8217;t support sticks.  How is that wrong?
<br />
<br />  In conclusion, I will not buy Freelancer and I am telling others not to bother so long as controller options are not available.  If the product isn&#8217;t right, boycott it until they fix it (and I encourage those who are also upset to do the same).  If this product is slated for a game console and controller support was in it at one time, then a patch to add controller support would not be difficult to do.  Until then, I will support and turn people to their competitors that do support sticks.  Hopefully DA will listen to the consumer base and offer options instead of snubbing a portion of their consumer base.  Time to hop off the soap box and load up some Tachyon, Combat Flight Sim 3 or Starlancer (something DA did right) instead. ;o)
<br />
<br />&lt;/rant&gt;
