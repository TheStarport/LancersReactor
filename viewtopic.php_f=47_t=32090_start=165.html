			<div class="content">OOC: well you just can't join, the other members have to approve and after that we have to think of a way that is logical to integrate you into the story.also if your going to be like othe other people that joined and only write a few sections before quitting with no definable exit piece, i would advise you not to join.I'm not trying to be harsh it just gets alittle annoying when you have to make sure a certain char. is in the story in one area and in the next hes totally gone with no post saying he can't write anymore or anything, i think thats happened three times now and i'm just abit cautious that its not going to become a trend.</div>

			<div class="content">OOC - @DeathSpike: I'm not fussed about you joining, just give us an idea of what you wanted your character to do, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:joker2015@hotmail.com">joker2015@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --> is my msn thingy. Other than that, it's good to see some new 'playas' in this RPG. (one of the first!)
<br />
<br />Lets get back into it! (gotta thank Harrier for de-spamming this thread<img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />IC - Jake:
<br />In the Court of Marduk I stood, a mere 'Lillim' as Marduk had reffered to me as. The towering stone throne stood proudly behind the avian 'god'. Marble pillars rose high above the ground, supporting the massive stone celing. It was strange to be in the graces of a 'superior' being; awe inspiring, but part of me beleived this to be some vasade, a false mask hiding the truth.
<br />
<br />&quot;My Ayans were born without the self preserving drive of fear, but that has lead them to great things, the mastery of Jump Drives, and other grand acheivments. It is a shame that Adam has grown jealous of other's creations.&quot; Marduk's voice boomed throughout his palace.
<br />&quot;How can we stop the Ikshions?&quot; I asked, making sure Marduk had finished.
<br />&quot;I doubt your pathetic flesh could acheive victory over a creator being, Lillim.&quot;
<br />
<br />At this point i had grown tired of Marduk's ridicule of the human race.
<br />
<br />&quot;Indigo, get in here.&quot;
<br />
<br />Indigo flew down through the hole in the ceiling, decloaking in the process.
<br />
<br />&quot;You think I am impressed by your pathetic daemon, Lillim? If you are threatening the great Marduk, I suggest you leave.&quot;
<br />
<br />I ignored his words, and began collecting solar energy, bootstrapping it to allow greater energy absorbtion. My feet lifted off the ground as I produced an anit-gravitational field around my body, and I rose above the ground. The energy in my systems began to reach their capacity, so again, I bootstrpped energy to allow storage in a charged ball in front of me. Marduk's smile was quickly wiped from his face, replaced with what looked like fear. When I spoke, it was echoed with a metallic undertone.
<br />
<br />&quot;You doubt this Lillim? Do you realise what you are dealing with?&quot;
<br />
<br />My voice dropped to sub-human pitch
<br />
<br />&quot;YOU DOUBT THE FRUIT OF KNOWLEGE?&quot;
<br />
<br />Marduk stared blankly at me, and then, without warning, threw some form of energy at me. Indigo swooped and absorbed it, adding to the ball in front of me.
<br />
<br />&quot;YOU ARE NOT A GOD! YOU ARE A PATHETIC CASTE, LILLIM!&quot;
<br />
<br />My voice softened
<br />
<br />&quot;I am not god, But neither are you. We are the same, composed of the same building blocks, the same components, and require the same neccissities to survive. And we are both mortal, capable of being injured.&quot;
<br />&quot;I AM IMMORTAL, LILLIM!&quot;
<br />
<br />Marduk's words were not without action. I unleashed part of the energy directly into his left arm. The flesh began to burn, searing pain flooding throughout Marduk's body. Eve started yelling.
<br />
<br />&quot;STOP THIS!&quot;
<br />
<br />There was silence as both Marduk and I looked at Eve, who was breathing heavily.
<br />
<br />&quot;We have a common enemy. There is no need to proove anything to each other.&quot;
<br />&quot;It is too late sweet Eve. I have seen the folly of underestimating Lucifer's work.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is not the work of Lucifer.&quot; I added.
<br />&quot;It is not? You have aquired power through other means?&quot;
<br />&quot;You have heard of the Fruit of Knowlege?&quot;
<br />&quot;You were not bluffing, you may be the key to stopping Adam's rampage.&quot;
<br />
<br />I began to bleed energy off, to release it safely. I was glowing a healthy white Indigo later said. Tiamat stuck his head out from behind a door.
<br />
<br />&quot;Is tsa fightsing over?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes Tiamat, You may come out now.&quot; Eve responded with a mother's tone on her voice.
<br />&quot;So how do we defeat Adam and the Ikshions?&quot; I asked.
<br />&quot;Aquire the Fruit of Life before Adam does. It seems that the Lillim have been chosen to carry the gifts of the gods, a shame, but there could be worse things. Since you have revealed that you have the Fruit of Knowlege, the power of the Fruit of Life will begin to enhace the abilities of the other Pure Spirit.&quot;
<br />&quot;Any guide to where to look?&quot;
<br />&quot;It will be the one who will you would naturally gravitate to, a female, as you Lillim call them.&quot;
<br />
<br />I turned and began to leave.
<br />
<br />&quot;I thank you Marduk,&quot;
<br />
<br />Marduk nodded.
<br />
<br />&quot;And sorry bout the arm.&quot;
<br />
<br />Marduk smiled and bid us farewell.
<br />
<br />It was time to return to Sol. The Ayan Tiamat was about to get a shock to his system. Humanity was not well known for its compassion to aliens...
<br />=:=
<br />The Shark - There is more to come, but i decided on what exactly fusion would entail, sorry arania, you're not the fruit of life.</div>

<br />anyhoo... ON WITH THE SHOW!
<br />
<br />IC - Aleksei:
<br />Anatoly had been a while on their latest mission, but with Claire and that Dragonborn guy as escort, I was somewhat releived. Somewhat being the key word. I had somehow disrupted my sleeping habits, so it was about midnight at time when the alarm went off.
<br />Screeching klaxons were wailing throughout the base, a common occourance, and most of the time the LRICs were enough to remove them. But this time it was worse. Much worse. The confederates had sent in Longinus cruisers, who were able to pierce shields, and had taken out half of the LRICs, and were raining fire down upon the earth. The confederates knew that the main fighter squadrons were away on mission. It seemed like a doom battle as I prepped the gunships for launch.
<br />
<br />Something had happened. The confederates had stopped firing for some reason. I questioned the lead gunship for intel.
<br />
<br />&quot;Baker Golf One-Niner, Status!&quot;
<br />&quot;WHAT THE **** IS THAT?&quot;
<br />&quot;Baker Golf One-Niner, respond! Send intel on situation!&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes sir! *away from speaker: get a camera feed up* Feeding a camera now.&quot;
<br />
<br />What I saw on the monitor was a shock to the system. The confederate fleet had been ripped to shreds by something... A fleet of ships that were not in the databases. Well, there was one ship in the prototype databases. The ZX-56 Daedalus. Jake had brought the cavalry in full force, a massive fleet of alien ships followed behind his heavy fighter. The comm crackled to life.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nexus Base Tango Niner Sierra, this is Zulu X-Ray Fife Six, requesting docking clearance.&quot;
<br />
<br />It was good to hear his voice again.
<br />
<br />&quot;Zulu X-Ray Fife Six, You are cleared for landing on docking port 1, I expect an ambassador will be accompianing you in?&quot;
<br />&quot;Affirmative Tango Niner Sierra, clear two docks for heavy and medium fighters.&quot;
<br />&quot;Roger that, 2 Docks will be cleared. Welcome back Jake. Earth could use a saivior.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />IC - Jake:
<br />There were very few plain faces on the day that i showed up at earth, after about 2 years of travelling. The time away from humanity had given me some more perspective about the human race. I called a briefing in the Nexus conference room, hoping to reach an agreement with the Ayans on a full military alliance.
<br />
<br />&quot;All righty, We got everyone who is avaliable for this meeting. Unfortunately, the Dragon Talon XL-17 squadron leaders are unavaliable, as is the head of Operations, but there is still enough to get this underway. Okay, we'll start with introductions.&quot;
<br />
<br />I went around the table.
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay, representing Earth and humanity is Aleksei Korenchkin, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Global Defence; Jennifer Aida, Director of Research and Development; Admiral Mark &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Thomson, Leader of the 3rd Earth Fleet...&quot;
<br />&quot;Whats left of it.&quot; Hacksaw interrupted.
<br />&quot;Of course, anyway, next is Daimien Johnson, Chief Quatermaster and owner of the only bar in the Nexus; Admiral Griffin, Chief Commander of the Warbird Fleet, Commander of all fringe territories and Agent 1st Class Kestrel, Director of Covert Operations. Now the people missing are Anatoly Korenchkin, Director of Operations and the finest shipwright in Sol; and Dragonborn, Head of Fighter testing, Director of Fleet command, and commander of the Dragon Talon fighter squadron.&quot;
<br />
<br />I took a drink as my throat was beginning to dry up.
<br />
<br />&quot;Reperesenting the Ayan Republic; Tiamat of Ishatsu, Commander of Ayan Fighter Squadrons; Mardichi of Avalion, Supreme Commander of the Ayan Fleet; Praetor Bashriel, Leader of the Ayan nation of Ishtsar; and Miri of Ishatsu, Commander of Covert Operations. I pray that you all will agree to the terms that i have outlined in the roughly put together treaty in front of you.&quot;
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />After 2 hours, the two allies had reached an agreement, entailing everything, from the war to life afterwards. Luckily, I had become fluent in Ayan, so Tiamat and I were the main translators to the new leaders of mankind.
<br />
<br />The Ayans had simple requests. They still had the majority of their population on Avalon, and Tiamat and I had found their missing colony fleet, which was en route as we spoke. All the Ayans wanted was a safe haven, a small area to call their own. It was decided that the continent of Asia would become the first Ayan nation outside of Avalon. The resettling of Earth would begin as one massive effort, a joint force of Ayan and Human workers would transform the planet, but would keep in mind the environment this time, and not make too much of a footprint on the planet.
<br />In return, They would focus their Navies toward stabilising Sol, also helping the Korenchkins perfect the first Sirius jump drive. Us humans would supply equipment, manpower and supplies to the Ayan homeworld, and after the war would construct jump gates and trade lanes to speed up trade to the new ally of Earth.
<br />
<br />The Ayans had begun to contruct their normal buildings, in centuries old fashion, using the natural jungles in south-east Asia, and their first colony was underway. I had to find the Fruit of Life, but I had someone to say hello to.
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />My cheek burned from the rather powerful slap Erin had delivered expertly to achieve maximum pain.
<br />
<br />&quot;You left without even saying goodbye. Why should I even speak to you?&quot;
<br />&quot;I could have left without the note, would have rathered that?&quot;
<br />&quot;No...&quot; Erin's voice began to waver. Within moments, she had thrown herself at me, as if to never let me get away again.
<br />&quot;God, I've missed you.&quot; she said through tears.
<br />&quot;As have I.&quot;

			<div class="content">OOC:good one Vi...er shark...er what am i sposed to call you now <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Your post gave me an idea but i cant write it now because i don't have time.Suffice it to say it might be a bit exciting.If i can write in right.
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT: time to rock and roll!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />   &quot;ok heres the plan, DT four, five and six you try and get through the blockade and send a distress signal to earth we'll porvide you and the transports cover&quot; i ordered over the comm.
<br />
<br />
<br />    After receiving the plans for the new capital ships and learning about the andromeda particle which can increase the activity of radioactive atoms in substances like uranium which could in a bomb, increase the effect tenfold or with a nebula such as this one turn it into a star.
<br />
<br />
<br />   I received a series of acknoledgements over the comm from my squadron as we took up a position ahead of the transports and the specified wing  prepared to make a run for it.Coincidentally the wing chosen for the job of sending a distress call was hispanic.Each wing was made up of different inhabitants of siruis except for the lead wing which was comprised of me, Claire and the best pilot i could find.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;transport leader, this is DT one, ready when you are&quot; i said over the comm beginning the operation.
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger DT one we are a go&quot; the transport pilot replied calmly considering the circumstances.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;All pilots take engines to full power and proceed towards the edge of the nebula&quot; I ordered the squadron.
<br />
<br />&quot;DT one, this is commander Dartenay, we have four Reaper gunships that were mothballed as they were outdated but i suppose that some help is better than no help&quot; He said interrupting my orders.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger commander, Squadron new orders, we also need to keep any coalition bombers away from the gunships&quot; i said and then ordered them to power up their weapons.
<br />
<br />   We cleared the edge of the nebula and saw four Battlestar class battlegroups, they each consisted of 6 Overlord class dreadnoughts, 10 Myrmidon cruisers and 18 Lancer class gunboats.With a untold number of fighters aboard each ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;DT wings ice and lightning give cover for fire wing, all other wings take a covering pattern around the convoy, those transports are our top priority&quot; i ordered over the comm keeping an eye on the range indicator.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />   30 kilometers, 15 kilometers, 10, at 3 kilometers they came out of cruise and activated their weapons.The small convoy made right for the flotilla ahead of them   
<br />looking like a spear trying to kill a large animal.
<br />
<br />&quot;this is earth wing we're going in cover us&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm hit i'm hit!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;this is wind leader i've lost my wing, critical hull damage i'm going down!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Water and Lava wings keep those bombers away from the Ragnarok&quot;I shouted dodging another burst of fire from the turrets of the lead dreadnought.
<br />
<br />&quot;This earth three i can't shake him, get him off me!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is DT leader, bank hard right earth three&quot;I ordered.
<br />
<br />Earth three swerved by giving me a clear shot at the fighter pursuing him.I fired, pummeling the fighters shields and when they went down i fired one of my precious firestalkers.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;AAAAGGGHHHH i cant hold it together AAAHHHH&quot; i heard a pilot scream.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Wind leader NOOOOOO!&quot;another pilot screamed.
<br />
<br />   Battle had been joined.
<br />
<br />
<br />                 *FIRE WING SOMEWHERE ENROUTE TO EARTH*
<br />
<br />&quot;this is fire leader cover me while i transmit the distress signal to Nexus control&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is fire three i'm getting some strange readings on my scanner sir&quot;A young and brash pilot known as &quot;Redman&quot; to his fellow pilots reported.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, 3 wings of Confederate fighters just decloaked!&quot;The other pilot known as &quot;Iceman&quot; reported.
<br />
<br />&quot;Cover me men i've got to get this message off&quot; Flightleader &quot;Moa&quot; ordered.
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger, targeting lead fighter, you got my six ice?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;i'm right behind ya, just like at the academy right?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;yeah, just like old times&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />  The 3 wings of confederate fighters blew right through &quot;Redman&quot; and &quot;Iceman&quot; and made for the last remaining fighter, Moa.Somewhere out in the depths of space a wing of fighters was destroyed, the pilot of the last fighter had just pressed the transmit button before he was destroyed.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />                                *NEXUS CONTROL: EARTH*
<br />
<br />     &quot;Sir we just got this priority one message in from the commander&quot; a comm. officer reported to Viator who snatched the old fashioned piece of paper from him.
<br />His look of joy at getting a treaty signed with the Ayans and fending off a possibly lethal Confederate attack were gone instantly. 
<br />
<br />  &quot;It looks like we have need of your help sooner than anticipated, i just got a printed message from Commander Dragonborn, it says, well i'll let you hear for yourself&quot; he finished nodding to the comm oficer.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Commander Dragonborn of the Alliance fighter squadron Dragon Talon to all vessels loyal to the Alliance, we were surrounded by Confederate battlegroups  while picking up plans for a new class of capital ship from a remote Alliance research base when we became aware of the situation, as it is the Blackheart nebula will become a new star in less than 45 minutes and us along with the entire research station will become space dust due to the Confederacy deploying their Andromeda particle cannons.We urge all forces loyal to the Alliance to lend aid in&quot;*static*
<br />
<br />&quot;It was a trick&quot; stated Tiamat, &quot;They used the attack here as a ploy so that we would not notice them sending forces to the nebula where the base is located&quot;
<br />
<br />   Viator became angry and started muttering obscenities about the commander and pounding his fist into the wall in a fit of anger.The Ayan ambassador spoke up.
<br />
<br />&quot;we will helps yous in yours time of need since yous helped us in ours&quot; he stated in highly accented basic.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />   The large fleet orbiting earth suddenly left orbit and charged their jump drives preparing for a microjump to the Black heart nebula.
<br />
<br />   All across the Sol system ships began to head for the only nebula in the system.From every walk of life they came, from nimble little pirate smuggler ships to massive freighters that could take up to a quarter of and hour to turn around to volunteer law enforcement officers on patrol and the customs officer they accompanied.Merchants and pirates flying side by side all heading for the same place to see if they could do one thing.Help keep the universe free.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />OOC: ooooh a CLIFFHANGER now lets see if YOU can save the universe from destruction....
<br />
<br />Viator:*mutters* and i thought i was being dramatic.
<br />
<br />DB:I heard that! 
<br />
<br />*chortles* sorry couldn't help myself but i thought i did a rather good job on this section.Tell me what you think.

<br />
<br />IC - Jake:
<br />
<br />I left Aleksei in charge of defence, as he usually was, the Warbird Second Fleet stood guard over Earth, it being the smallest. I had taken command of the rest of the fleet, and flew out toward the nebula in question.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright boys, lets get rocking. Alpha Wing, form up with Bravo Wing, Delta and Echo Wings, escort the main battleships, Admiral Griffin.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />&quot;Prepare your 1st, 3rd, and 5th fleets for front line combat&quot;
<br />&quot;You got it friend.&quot;
<br />
<br />I looked down beside my feet where the Hyobajan, which almost ensured my survival, according to Ayan mythology. I finished the battle orders as the entire group dropped back into real space. What greeted us was not very reassuring.
<br />There was 2 badly damaged gunships, and not very many fighters left. I recognised one of them instantainiously. Helena had obviously gotten over her difficulties with Anatoly and they were dancing around the confederate fighters like a mechanical break dancer.
<br />I decided to make the battlegroup noticable to everyone fighting. I rummaged through the junk behind my seat and found what i was looking for: an antique bugle. I began to play a tune taught to me by my uncle who said it was played by the cavalry when they entered battle. I hit the comm switch for all channels and screamed into it.
<br />
<br />&quot;CHAAAAARGE!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />I hit the afterburners as did the rest of my wing, aimed straight for the lead carrier. I powered up Betsy, my rather faithful MagLev Rail Driver and aimed at the power core of the leading Confederate capital ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;When you meet Adam, tell him I sent ya!&quot; I said to myself in the cockpit.
<br />
<br />The magnetic energy began to build, and the slug hurtled out of the barrel toward the power core. A confederate fighter got in the way, but it was decimated, only slowing the slug by a small fraction. The bolt hit its target, with the core overloading and quickly destroying the massive capital ship in seconds. The other  confederates disengaged and attempted to flee, but were blocked by the Ayan fleets, which tore the Confederate ships to pieces. But there were other problems, like the nebula.
<br />
<br />&quot;GET AWAY FROM THE NEBULA!&quot; I yelled into the comm.
<br />
<br />All the allied fleets and fighter squads began retreating except for me. I began to gather energy from the power core of the Daedalus, and then used that to produce more. The energy I was producing was one similar to the tachyon distortion I had created before, only millions of times bigger. I began to slow the time inside the nebula, with great difficulty.
<br />
<br />&quot;Indigo, set the autopilot for the Nexus&quot;
<br />
<br />Indigo nodded her acknowlegment and began to het the autopilot sequence.
<br />
<br />&quot;Here we go&quot;
<br />
<br />The temporal distortion had taken its toll on me, almost frying my nano-augmented mind, and as the field began to fail, I hit the autopilot confirm, and the nebula collapsed on itself, leaving my comatose body to be buffeted by a subspace shockwave, hurtleing towards earth at full jump speed.
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />It was about a week before I came to in my 'quarters', the nano machines in my system obviously needed time to repair my fragile flesh, and my use of the nano circuits would do more damage than good. When I finally came to, I had a strange feeling of deja vu as Erin was sitting by me again, her face radient as ever.
<br />
<br />&quot;I must have been wrong about heaven...&quot; I said, almost delerious.
<br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br />&quot;Last time I checked, angels were mythological creatures...&quot;
<br />
<br />Erin's face softened.
<br />
<br />&quot;At least you are back to your normal self. Now rest some more, you've did quite a bit a week ago.&quot; she said, her voice soothing every nerve in my body.
<br />&quot;Thank you Erin.&quot;
<br />&quot;I still owe you for rescuing me, you are almost too good for this world.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>Of course I am </i> I thought, <i>I'm one of the Pure, the Fruit of Knowlege... but... could she be the other? Nah... can't be. I would have noticed something... Even though her arms seem bigger... </i>
<br />With that I fell asleep with Erin's gentle hands brushing the hair out of my face.

			<div class="content">OOC: damnit, now i have to modify y section that i finally fnished
<br />
<br />IC:
<br />Location: Hackers Sanctuary, Hades.
<br />
<br />To be honest, the last time I remember being so exhausted was years ago, and it wasn&#8217;t really something I expected. When you&#8217;re a being that can flatten entire civilisations at a whim, create life, and traverse the universe in a heartbeat, you don&#8217;t really expect to get tired.
<br />Yet now, I could barely even lift my arm.
<br />Frustrating&#8230;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What a rush&#8221; I muttered, to no-one in particular
<br />&#8220;Indeed&#8221; Araminta replied, her usually glowing form now dull, if that is even possible for a phoenix
<br />Gathering some ambient energy from around me, I managed to struggle out of the bed.
<br />I marvelled at how intricate the room was, it was furnished with delicate furniture, cupboards, eve the carpeting had such a complicated design on it that it began to become hard to look at it.
<br />&#8220;Hard to believe this could be made is such a barren world, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
<br />I turned, noticing the hacker that had greeted me standing behind me.
<br />&#8220;I believe an introduction is in order?&#8221; I said, tired of not knowing who I was staying with
<br />&#8220;I am Phreak&#8221; He replied
<br />&#8220;Yes, I remember you&#8221; I replied, recalling a vague image of him
<br />&#8220;As I do of you&#8221; Phreak replied &#8220;But I am unfamiliar with that bird of yours&#8221;
<br />&#8220;This is Araminta&#8221; I replied &#8220;My, uhhhh&#8230;.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;D&#230;mon&#8221; Araminta finished
<br />The confusion on Phreak&#8217;s face was obvious
<br />&#8220;My soul&#8221; I explained &#8220;The form indicates your personality, to a degree, among other things&#8221;
<br />The confusion was still there.
<br />&#8220;Like a familiar&#8221; Araminta said &#8220;but better, or worse, depending on how you look at it&#8230;&#8221;
<br />He showed some recognition, but not much.
<br />I took that moment of weakness to look inside his mind.
<br />A troubled childhood, fair enough. Successful at school, depressed, loveless, Confederate slave.
<br />Well, he seemed genuine enough.
<br />&#8220;Do you have a room that I could meditate in?&#8221; I asked
<br />&#8220;Well, the best would probably be the datatower&#8221; Phreak said.
<br />&#8220;The what?&#8221; Ara and I said in unison
<br />
<br />The Datatower turned out to be quite impressive, to say the least.
<br />My first impression was one of light and brightness, as the optical core right in front of me gave off light from its holographic interface.
<br />Once my eyes had adjusted, I looked around to see that it wasn&#8217;t a room, but rather a platform surrounding a massive pipe, running from far down in the pit below, to high up.
<br />Situated around the thin platform on the edge of the tower were six full-body Neural interfaces.
<br />I looked across to the central data pipe.
<br />&#8220;Feel free to use any equipment in here&#8221; Phreak said
<br />I started walking across the narrow bridge to the Data core, and looked down
<br />The construction was almost Poetic, Massive amounts of fibre-optic cables spiralled down the edge of the tower, periodically punctuated by small piping that jumped over to the core tower.
<br />I closed my eyes, and stepped into the core, concentrating as I went.
<br />The feeling of a conscious shift in your awareness is difficult to describe, like a cross between having a freezing shower and getting knocked unconscious.
<br />Not that it matters.
<br />
<br />
<br />The next thing I knew, everything was gone, replaced by a perfect whiteness.
<br />I took Ara off my shoulder, staring at her, wondering when, across thousands of timelines and universes how she had come into being. Doubtless she was a gift, I determined that LONG ago.
<br />It was incredible how centuries of research into the human psyche have nothing on the simplicity on having a D&#230;mon.
<br />&#8220;Are you ever able to be cheered up?&#8221; Ara said.
<br />&#8220;You would know, you are me&#8221; I replied.
<br />Ara laughed
<br />&#8220;True, True&#8221; Ara giggled
<br />&#8220;I am happy when I&#8217;m with you&#8221; I said, pacing around the void whiteness
<br />Ara nipped my ear. Not painfully, but it got my attention.
<br />I looked at her, staring into her eyes, or, more accurately, the eye that was facing me.
<br />I smiled, feeling relaxation for the first time in decades.
<br />A small laugh escaped me, and before Ara could react, I swept her off my shoulder and was spinning her around, amid squawking and flames.
<br />&#8220;Playful, I remember that&#8221; Proteus said, appearing behind me, Nomad-formed and speaking in that sinister echoing voice of his.
<br />Ara slipped loose and flapped up onto my head.
<br />I floated into the air, the whiteness around me being replaced by a large star field.
<br />&#8220;Nowhere much for you to go, is there?&#8221; I said to Proteus.
<br />Proteus shook his eyestalk &#8220;No-one that would keep me alive anyway&#8221;
<br />I recalled something he had told me long ago:
<br />&#8220;Human air is not particularly friendly towards nomads, we can only survive a few hours without a host, human or otherwise&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Not that we can go anywhere&#8230;&#8221; Araminta muttered.
<br />&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;re not meant to&#8221; I thought out loud
<br />&#8220;How so?&#8221; Proteus asked
<br />&#8220;Well, think&#8221; I said &#8220;The Confederation had predicted everything that I would do, except Ara&#8217;s forming. This threw them off enough for me to attack them, and get dumped here&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Your point?&#8221; Proteus said
<br />&#8220;Maybe this is the end of my timeline&#8221; I Concluded &#8220;The confederates can read fate, so they delivered me to it&#8221;
<br />&#8220;You know that&#8217;s not true&#8221; Araminta said &#8220;You&#8217;re just doubting yourself again&#8221;
<br />&#8220;I&#8221; I stuttered, &#8220;I just wish I knew what I was meant to do&#8221;
<br />I put my head in my hands.
<br />&#8220;No good sitting there&#8221; came another voice
<br />Proteus&#8217; stance became a bit more submissive
<br />&#8220;Great, party of the subconscious mind&#8221; Said Ara
<br />My Ara
<br />The pieces fit together quicker than I could see them
<br />&#8220;My Ara&#8221; I muttered &#8220;My D&#230;mon&#8221;
<br />&#8220;What?&#8221; Said the Ancient
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s why they couldn&#8217;t predict it&#8221; I said &#8220;Because they don&#8217;t know what she is&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Be that as it may&#8221; the Ancient said &#8220;Your priority is stopping the Confederates from reaching Sirius&#8221;
<br />He has a habit for stating the obvious, doesn&#8217;t he?
<br />&#8220;A task made all the more difficult&#8221; He continued &#8220;By the war raging there&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Its weakening the barrier, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I asked
<br />The Ancient nodded
<br />&#8220;But, as soon as I go through&#8221; I concluded &#8220;They will go through the gateway I formed&#8221;
<br />&#8220;They would get through eventually&#8221;
<br />&#8220;We can only hope&#8221; Proteus spoke his mind &#8220;That Viator can help&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Hope is all we have&#8221; I said, dropping out of the meditation
<br />
<br />Several hours later, and everyone was ready to go.
<br />I channelled energy into the gate, opening the portal to earth
<br />I sensed the turmoil of the world had changed, and I sensed my counterpart, looking for something, big. Something that would help ultimately secure Humanity from evil, and from the Confederation.
<br />They lost their humanity long ago.
<br />&#8220;Make yourselves comfortable&#8221; I said to the Exiles, warping up to the Nexus landing platform.
<br />I then noticed something quite startling. Viator&#8217;s ship was there, holding the telltale marks of a massive battle with the confederation
<br />&#8220;I should&#8217;ve known&#8221; I said to Ara &#8220;Humanity isn&#8217;t that incompetent&#8221;
<br />I dematerialised, spreading my spirit around Earth as a temporary guardian. Might as well put myself to use until Viator wakes up&#8230;</div>

<br />IC - Jake:
<br />
<br />White. Pure White.
<br />
<br />Most of the time whenever I 'sleep', I never dream. Ever. For some reason, the nanites had all been redirected to repair jobs, letting my subconcious run wild.
<br />At least I thought it was my subcouncious...
<br />
<br />Out of the white stepped Eve, Exactly as the was she had been created, a being born 'pure', able to create new races. That always disturbed me, every human being had been capable of creating a new 'race''.
<br />
<br />&quot;Viatooor&quot; Eve's voice was floaty and disembodied. &quot;Adam knows...fruit....life....protect....you mus...t...protect&quot;
<br />
<br />This had to be a dream.
<br />Eve moved closer and her hands grabbed my head forcefully, as if to drive the point home.
<br />
<br />&quot;Adam knows you found her. You have to protect her.&quot;
<br />
<br />I remained confident in the thought of this being a dream.
<br />
<br />&quot;And rest assured. This is not a dream.&quot;

<br />
<br />IC - Jake:
<br />It had been a while since I had suffered the ill effects of a hangover. I guess a lack of proper sleep was to blame, but as I got off the bed, I could feel the nanites in my body releasing painkillers to ease the throbbing pain in my head. I looked around the room, scanning for Indigo's dark silhouette against the darkened room. Her head raised slowly from where she was resting, her small eyes glowing in the darkness.
<br />I found some clothes when I realised that something was wrong. The door had been sealed from the outside. Erin was gone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Something's wrong, isn't it, Vi?&quot; Indigo questioned, gracefully flying over to my shoulder.
<br />&quot;Let's just say I have a gut feeling about it.&quot;
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />Walking through the Nexus, I kept my eyes open for any signs of life, but found only death. Whenever I listened for pulse of beating heart, I heard only a deafening silence of cold steel. I made a left and headed for the control room. Indigo started to get jittery. She could sense the presence of something. I knelt down and placed my hand on the floor, feeling for any pulse, any breath, any warmth. I noticed something above me. a small beat, irregular, yes, but a beat still. In the A-22 storage room. I headed for the stairs. I had progressed from a cautious walk to a full speed run, putting every nanite into keeping my velocity constantly high. I had reached the top leverl of the facility in record time, and I knelt down to reaquaint myself with my position. Fifth door on the left, storage room A-22.
<br />
<br />I found myself at the entrance to the room, the door had been thrown off its rails, massive amounts of furniture had been hurriedly placed in front of the doorway to prevent injury. I placed my hand on the door, and was shocked by the sensation. There were two people inside, one on the brink of death, the other quite healthy, albeit scared to death. I placed the door back on its rails, rolling it back into its housing. I heard a scream from inside, followed by whispering.
<br />
<br />&quot;Aleksei... he's still here!&quot;
<br />&quot;Take him out... while you *cough* can. Take the pistol.&quot;
<br />
<br />I couldn't have mistaken that voice.
<br />
<br />&quot;Aleksei!&quot;
<br />
<br />I could hear the female voice whisper more, but was unable to hear it properly. Then, there was a scrambling and a flurry of noise as the furniture was rapidly removed from the doorway. What greeted me when she had finished was distressing. Aleksei Korenchkin lay in a pool of his own blood, and next him was the body of his brother, Anatoly. I rushed in, and began to use my nanites to heal Aleksei's wounds. I had done what I could. I turned to the body of Anatoly, bowing my head in prayer for his departed soul.
<br />
<br />&quot;Aleksei, what happened here?&quot; I asked.
<br />&quot;When you had returned from the nebula battle, we had detected an energy field around the planet, it wasn't being destructive, so we let it be, but then something strange happened.&quot;
<br />&quot;What?&quot;
<br />&quot;The energy focused in a single point... then something collided with it, ripping straight through it, carrying it into the Nexus. Next thing we knew, we were over-run with Ikshions. The Ayans took most of the people on the base to safety, but they couldn't get everyone, and those of us left tried to hold the Nexus. We kept getting beaten back, and that's when it got weird. For some reason, they stopped and withdrew, just like that.&quot;
<br />&quot;Do you remember anything else?&quot;
<br />
<br />Aleksei's femal friend spoke up.
<br />
<br />&quot;There was a man with the Ikshions, he was bath-&quot;
<br />&quot;Bathed in pure white light, wearing nothing but what he was born in...&quot; I interrupted.
<br />&quot;Yeah... that's right&quot;
<br />&quot;...Adam.&quot;
<br />
<br />Aleksei looked at me strange.
<br />
<br />&quot;Adam? Jake, you're not making sense.&quot;
<br />
<br />So thats why the door was sealed. Erin had saved me by giving herself up, but Adam knew that if he had her, then I would come to her aid. So that wasn't a dream, Eve was warning me, but I was unable to wake from my slumber. I couldn't save Erin without delivering myself into the devil's lair. But there was something I had to do, Hell was rumoured never to freeze over, but my prescence was going to send a chill through Adam's spine. When the angels have been corrupted, then maybe my last hope lay in the hands of a demon.
<br />
<br />&quot;Aleksei, what ships are left?&quot;
<br />&quot;None, except maybe some prototypes in the labs, but most of them are unfinished...&quot;
<br />&quot;They will do. Tell the Ayans to return to the base, there's no enemies left here.&quot;
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />I stood in the Z-Axis prototype labs, staring at all the half-baked ideas and partly completed projects. The Doomtrain was strewn about in pieces, as Anatoly was probably enhancing it somehow. but in the back lay something familiar. something I had not seen for a long time. The only complete ship left in the lab was Anatoly's pet project, the Reflex fighter. It seemed that Anatoly could not keep his mind off of the idea of a super nimble fighter, and the new jump drives were the key to it's success, a jump-capable civilian fighter. It was going to make Anatoly rich. Now it was going to save mankind. I moved it to the launch bay, and set off to find the mother of mankind. Lillith.

			<div class="content">&quot;Ow&quot; I moaned, half fused to the floor
<br />The floor was scorched, and the room was pitch black, restricting my vision to literally right in front of my nose.
<br />&quot;Ara?&quot; I yelled to the area
<br />Nothing responded, and that worried me.
<br />&quot;Araminta!&quot; I screamed
<br />Nothing but echoes
<br />I concentrated, thinking outside the square...
<br />Where could she be? 
<br />
<br />I thought back...
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Nexus docking portal to incoming transport craft, identify owner and purpose of visit&quot; Barked the Nexus controller
<br />I sensed trouble on that ship
<br />&quot;Repeat, this is nexus control, identify yourself&quot;
<br />Now i was concerned, standard proceedure was to disable non-responsive incoming craft.
<br />&quot;Answer!&quot;
<br />Well, they did, sortof...
<br />The incoming ship loosed a single antimatter charge at the control sattelite.
<br />&quot;Just my day&quot; i thought, blocking the charge.
<br />Then i sensed it, impossibly, i SAW it before i sensed it. Hundreds of Ikshion landing craft, hovering in orbit.
<br />&quot;Now this is what you call an 'Aw S**t' moment&quot; I said to Ara
<br />&quot;too true&quot; She said, indicating an invisible entity hovering among the fleet.
<br />I focussed on the being.
<br />&quot;It cant be, can it?&quot; I muttered &quot;Adam? The firstborn HUMAN?&quot;
<br />It was indeed adam. and he didnt look friendly.
<br />I reduced myself to a point, intending to counter Adam before the Ikshions got a chance to land.
<br />I was never prepare for what happened next. Adam charged straight at me, along with a good portion of the Ikshions.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is going to hurt&quot; I said, bracing myself with the equivelent of a supernova's energy as a shield
<br />The next few microseconds were a blur, i saw Adam about to tackle me with an energy ball, and i felt Ara get hurt, but the only cognitive recollection i had was thinking:
<br />&quot;This guy needs a shave, and for that matter, a pair of pants&quot;
<br />
<br />I almost started to panic, but refused it, it wouldve led nowhere
<br />Until a branding pain surfaced, almost ripping my heart out.
<br />Adam had Araminta.
<br />&quot;ARA!!!!!!!!&quot; I scremed, making the Nexus shudder and echo.
<br />I anchored on Aras life signuature, and teleported.
<br />
<br />I expected Adam to either in a lavish fortress, or a sleepy grotto. Not the Torture chamber of an Ikshion ship...
<br />With my d&#230;mon and Erin no less.
<br />He had Erin lying on some sort of sacrificial table, with Ara strung up behind him.
<br />&quot;By the captured power of the one Arania, and the fruit of life, i shall rule the universe&quot; Adam said.
<br />He took the container with Ara down and held it above his head.
<br />Hes gonna kill her. HES GONNA KILL ME! 
<br />I heard a faint voice.
<br />&quot;Help me&quot;
<br />It was her
<br />I felt my anger rise. He had severed us!
<br />&quot;HOW DARE YOU!&quot; I screamed, unleashing a massive energy bolt at Ara's cage
<br />It disintegrated in one smooth explosion, and Ara was free.
<br />Adam merely smiled.
<br />&quot;Greetings&quot; He said, as ara flapped onto my shoulder &quot;I have heard much about you, but one is all i neet to know.&quot;
<br />&quot;Uh huh?&quot; I said, channeling energy into the severed link between me and Ara, restoring it
<br />&quot;I have beaten you before, i can do it again&quot; Adam stated simply
<br />I smiled
<br />He put his hands on Erin's chest &quot;Soon, i will burn like the brightest star&quot;
<br />&quot;You're gonna burn all right&quot;
<br />Adam smirked, and began extracting Erin's soul.
<br />&quot;And you need to shave&quot; I said, hurling a massive graviton wave at his face.
<br />It wiped the smirk of his face at least, and i couldnt complain about him shaving, i had ripped the hair out.
<br />&quot;For a child of Lillith, you have power&quot; Adam said, ignoring Erin now and coming towards me.
<br />Mental note: Get Erin off the ship 
<br /><b>I know that Ara     </b>
<br />Thats all that mattered, get Erin to Viator.
<br />&quot;Wrong&quot; I said, backing up &quot;peuro sidereus  actually&quot;
<br />&quot;Child of the Stars?&quot; Adam said, advancing
<br />&quot;To be literal&quot; I replied, finding what i was after.
<br />The light switch.
<br />
<br />&quot;Why you little...&quot; Adam said, before i delivered a crippling blow to his third and fifth vertebre brom behind.
<br />That only served to anger him, apparently, as he simply walked forward and turned the lights back on, turned around, and faced me again.
<br />This time i stood my ground.
<br />Adam advanced, with no intention of stopping.
<br /><b>Then i will have to MAKE you stop, won't i?    </b>
<br />I gathered a ball of energy in each hand.
<br />He kept coming
<br />&quot;Dont do this&quot; I said
<br />I fired at him, with about the effect of trying to knock down a tree with a feather. He just blocked it with one hand.
<br />Adam swung, trying to use my balance against me. I ducked, and his hand went flying over my head.
<br />I sniffed
<br />&quot;What is that SMELL??&quot; I said, jumping back up &quot;Do you wash?&quot;
<br />He swung again, angrier.
<br />I blocked that one, but he WAS strong.
<br />Adam grabbem my arm, atempting to break it.
<br />I gathered heat in that same arm, smashing a fireball point-blank into Adam's arm.
<br />He cringed, and snached back his arm
<br />I could smell the burning flesh.
<br />Adam smiled, and dropped the still-burning forearm to his side.
<br />I was horrified
<br />I spun around, flinging an energy ball at his face.
<br />When i looked back, he was cradling his face, but only for a minute, and i didnt really want to see the result of my attack.
<br />Half his flesh was gone, and i could clearly see his blackened jawbone and some of his lower skull
<br />Well, one more trick...
<br />I summoned a crowbar
<br />&quot;Hah&quot; Adam laughed, his flesh healing &quot;What do you propose to do with that?&quot;
<br />&quot;This&quot; i said, flipping the crowbar upside down and ripping it violently up between his legs.
<br />The scream was bloodcurdling, and quite high-pitched.
<br />I let go of the Crowbar.
<br />&quot;Never played half-life i see&quot; I sniggered, walking to Erin
<br />She was quite unconcious, but not harmed, thankfully.
<br />I pulled her off the table, cradling her im my arms, before dematerialising, taking Erin with me.
<br />I had a friend to visit.
<br />
<br />OOC- Peuro Sideris does indeed literally mean &quot;Child of the Stars&quot; in latin. my intended translation was 'star child' but i couldnt find a good word that matched. This was the best i could find.

			<div class="content">OOC: my my my my my,what a twist, now let see here...
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />  The surprise ikshion attack was possible against us because of the small &quot;dead zone&quot; in between the 2 stars as SOL was now a binary star system.I had, like all the other fighter pilots been scrambled to try and hold them off until everyone could be evacuated to a safehouse in a nearby system.
<br />   I was able to do quite abit of damage as i had been ablet to add a couple of railguns to my armament of deadly beam weapons, but my XL-17 could only take so much punishment and i could only dodge so many turrets, eventually i had to retreat from the battle to the farside of the moon and this is where something quite strange happened.
<br />
<br />   &quot;this is DT one i've gotta pull out for the automated repair systems to catch up with the level of damage i've taken&quot; i radioed the ragtag group of fighters left.
<br />
<br />  As i waited impatiently for the nanites to repair my ship's systems i picked up a trace tachyon signature similar to the one that viator used to manipulate time, but jake was still down on the planet, curious i moved to investigate.What i saw stunned me, for floating in space infront of me was what looked like a very advanced version of my own fighter.
<br />
<br />&quot;Trinity give me an analysis of that fighter&quot; i almost whispered.
<br />
<br />&quot;it has the same basic design as your own fighter, however there have been many improvements, from what i can tell this ship can stay cloaked for over 25 standard days without having to recharge the capacitor among other things&quot; she replied with a small amount of awe in here voice.
<br />
<br />  Suddenly a long semi-clear tube started to come towards us from the fighter, i tried to back away but i couldn't get my fighters engines to start.it slowly approached the cockpit of my fighter and finally merged with it creating a tunnel between the fighters, instinctively i opened my cockpit and started towards the other fighter through the tube, as i aproached the fighter i noticed that it was empty.As i got closer the canopy started to open of its own accord.I floated into the cockpit of the fighter in zero-g, but as soon as i and trinity were inside the gravity came on and the tubelike tunnel of unknown energy dissipated.
<br />
<br />  I looked around my surroundings trying to figure out who would have been able to make all these improvements without my permission, i was on charge of the production of all XL-17's.A small viewscreen on fron of me came on and a fuzzy picture of somebody appeared on it.
<br />
<br />&quot;whoever you are your going to get fired for this, noone! tampers with my fighter without permission&quot; i said starting off one of my terrible rants which were well known on the nexus when something didn't go right.
<br />
<br />&quot;well i guess you better arrest yourself then&quot; the voice said, and as i watched the picture cleared and i saw a much older man that was unmistakably me.shocked, i just stared at the picture until i heard a faint hum from the fighter.
<br />
<br />&quot;you are not needed here yet, the fruit of knoledge and the ancient one do not need your help, but there are others that are in grave danger that could forever alter history, that is why i must send you to a destination far from here&quot; as he finished saying this the fighter corrected its trajectory as it had ben drifting along in a geosychronous orbit and charged its jumpdrive, as i watched space seemed to stretche out as i was flung an unkown distance to a far galaxy to aid some unkown race of beings.
<br />
<br />
<br />OOC: bummer you beat me to it, and am i the only one who remembered that sol was now a binary star system!!!?
