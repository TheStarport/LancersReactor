			<h3><a href="#p322718" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">It had been two weeks since the strange readings had started and the Nomad jump gate had mysteriously activated. The freelancer, a man who went by the name Dragon was sitting in, of all ships a Basilisk. &quot;This is Dragon to Planet Primas request permission to dock&quot; He didn't get an answer. Suddenly a Nomad fighter appeared on his scanners. &quot;Here it comes.&quot; He thought. The Nomad invasion that he feared had arrived. He switched all power to shields and waited. The Nomad flew closer and closer but then, it blew up as a fighter decloaked behind it. Dragon turned on his cloaking device and fled to the jump hole as a battleship flew into view, a battleship with three wings of the Black Guard.
<br />
<br />On the opposite side of The Sirius Sector a Bounty Hunter by the name of Jake Tanner chased an Outcast through the sacred Unknown jump hole. &quot;Surrender Bounty Hunter the radiation will destroy your Hammerhead before my Sabre.&quot;The Outcast sounded desperate so Jake took no notice. Two Shifters appeared; these looked like a cross between a Shroud and a Reaper but outclassed both combined. The Outcast ejected and blew up. &quot;This is Baxter station surrender or you will be destroyed.&quot;
<br />
<br />All the news that's fit for you this is the colony news service.
<br />&quot;This is Melinda Hawk reporting from Rheinland. With mounting tension about the Corsair invasion the Rheinland Navy has been forced to retreat to New Berlin. The Frankfurt system has now been abandoned and all hope for recapture seems to have died in the smouldering ruins of the system defences. Melinda Hawk signing off from Planet New Berlin.&quot;
<br />
<br />Dragon flew out of the cloud as fast as he could but when he flew to Crete he saw something he would never forget. Over thirty Nomad ships were engaged in a fight with the Corsairs. Wasting no time he engaged the Nomads. Catching the first one off guard he flew after the Gunboat destroying it. He took two seconds to survey the battle. The Corsairs were alive but seven to fifteen means that wouldn't last long. &quot;Well, well, well, what have we here?&quot; &quot;What? This was insane!&quot; He thought that cold voice he knew it. Suddenly the entire Coalition second fleet warped in. &quot;This is Corsair blue eleven retreat.&quot; The army of Nomads seemed insignificant next to this, this, army of doom. Dragon didn't want to flee but knew the odds of surviving weren't his favour. The cold voice spoke again. &quot;Well you will agree that our warp projectors have come a long way. Tell me how did you survive.&quot; &quot;I could ask you the same thing, Ivan Petrov.&quot; &quot;So you remember me.&quot; Ivan said with a laugh. &quot;Love to stay and chat Butcher but I've got other plans.&quot; With that Dragon warped to the Omega-41 jump hole.
<br />
<br />All the news that's fit for you this is the colony news service.
<br />&quot;This is Alan Bush reporting from Frankfurt where the Corsairs have retreated leaving it open for the Navy to move in and retake it. No one knows why but the Navy doesn't care and will have regained complete control by next week. In other news renowned Bounty Hunter Jake Tanner has disappeared in the border worlds on a mission to recover some alien artefact research. More on that story later Alan Bush out.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Luke Moore with the Alliance Conflict News December 12 3654. News from the front is that the Coalition has taken three more solar systems and will move in on the Sol system before next year. All attempts to hold them off have failed.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is insane.&quot; Jake thought. Everyone in The Sirius Sector knew about the Alliance but the technology on this ship doesn't look one thousand years in the making. &quot;No doubt you're wondering about our technology, why its not advanced.&quot; The man wore a captain's uniform. &quot;Ten years after the Sleeper Ships were launched we invented a weapon to force the coalition out of Sol, and in a way it worked they left.&quot; &quot;How.&quot; Jake asked amazed. &quot;It erased technology. We hit Jupiter, Saturn and Mars before they left so we thought they weren't much of a threat and we settled down. Do you remember the Dark Ages? We advanced so little in that period of time when we should have been colonizing planets in the year 2000. We had a few major breakthroughs in technology in our millennia long Dark Ages. Five hundred years ago we uncovered a thing we call a Hyper Warp Gate. It was in pretty bad condition but we managed to build a warp projector that would take us from Sol to here in one jump.&quot; &quot;What about the Coalition.&quot; Asked Jake &quot;Oh they were gathering their forces and nine hundred years ago when we had finally recovered from the Eraser Guns side-effects they attacked with their new fighters they call Hydras. Strangely enough our Shifters were based on them.&quot; Jake was amazed at this but kind of relieved, if the Coalition attacked the Houses stood a chance. &quot;Sounds like you guys need some help.&quot;

			<div class="content">ive finally done another part in my story. i would like it if someone gave their opinion good or bad since this is only the second story ive started writing. this parts bigger then the last one by a fare bit.
<br />
<br />Dragon sat in the cockpit in his ship thinking. This is the first time he&#8217;d left the Omicron Gamma system for five years unless you count going into the Unknown system. It wasn&#8217;t the longest time he&#8217;d spent in one place. That was about, two hundred and ninety five thousand seven hundred and eighty five days give or take half a year. He remembered it well, too well.
<br />&quot;Come on there&#8217;s nothing for you here.&quot; The man, Steiner said. &quot;No I'm not giving up not now not ever.&quot; Dragon was in a stolen Basilisk. &quot;Moose tell him.&quot; Said Steiner getting desperate. &quot;No I'm with Dragon on this one.&quot; Moose said distracted, as he was busy checking the radar. &quot;Okay Dragon you can do what you want to but let me say this. What if you don't come and the Coalition finds them we could really use you if that happened.&quot; There was a pause and then Dragon said. &quot;Fine but only because I'd rather die knowing the fate of those ships.&quot;
<br />Suddenly Dragons daydreaming was rudely interrupted. &quot;This is Rhienland Navy Yellow 2 to Dragon you are unregistered and under arrest cut your engines.&quot; &quot;This is Dragon to Navy person shut up I&#8217;m busy.&quot; &quot;Don&#8217;t mock me Dragon. Are, you were banished and your registration, was deleted.
<br /> I was going to arrest you but now I'll kill you. Wing engage.&quot; The three Rhienland Valkyries closed in. Dragon cloaked flew behind the leader and decloaked. &quot;This is for being a basted.&quot; He blew him up. The other two were freaked out, nothing like that had been seen since the Nomad war. The two men tried to retreat but it was too little too late. &quot;This is for being a wimp.&quot; Dragon flew at one. He fired a Raptor missile then fired a few shots and finally rammed into the back of the Rhienlander blowing him up. He let the last one escape; it would be interesting to hear about this on the news.
<br />         
<br />&quot;Sir. I am pleased to report that you have completely recovered from the freezing process and the surgery.&quot; The man wasn't as skittish around his commander as most people but the man he was talking to didn't care. &quot;Excellent and my fighter.&quot; It was the cold voice of Ivan &quot;the butcher&quot; Petrov. &quot;Ready to launch.&quot; The man was scared of Ivan but he didn&#8217;t let it show in his voice. &quot;Are you sure you want to fly right now its only been two weeks.' Ivan Petrov turned around. &quot;do you doubt my skills as a pilot.&quot; &quot;No sir, never sir.&quot; The man was visibly trembling now. &quot;Then shut up and stop making an idiot of yourself.&quot; Ivan didn't sound angry if anything he sounded amused. &quot;Yes sir. Sorry sir.&quot; The man, Nicoli walked out. Ivan hated the man because he reminded him of his brother. He'll get his revenge in time.
<br />
<br />All the news that&#8217;s fit for you this is the colony news service.
<br />&quot;This is Melinda Hawk reporting from Rhienland were Navy pilot has reported that someone killed the other two members of his wing. Also he said the person was in an unidentified cloaking fighter using weapons and missiles he had never seen before. Sounds like some-ones &quot;confiscated&quot; to much Cardamine, this is Melinda Hawk signing off&quot; &quot;Hi this is Nathan Clarke reporting from Kusari. The bounty hunter Jake Tanner still hasn't shown up. The Bounty Hunters Guild has attempted a push into Omicron Alpha only to find both he and his target disappeared into an unknown jump hole. The Guild would have stayed longer but the strange alien race called the Nomads frequently patrol the hole and one of their groups came upon the three ships. This is Nathan Clarke out.&quot;
<br />
<br />The alliance was impressed. It took Jake two days to learn how to fly a shifter better then most of their pilots. &quot;Have you memorised the shifters weapons yet.&quot; &quot;Six hard points a Nova Cannon, two Gattling Laser Cannons, Blind Fire, Spectral Shields and a Tachyon Cannon.&quot; Jake was bored so he said he would memorise the fighters capabilities. &quot;Damn.&quot; The man said impressed. A siren went off. &quot;What is that?&quot; &quot;Get to the briefing room and find out.&quot; It was an order. &quot;Yes sir.&quot; Jake said as he left
<br />
<br />Dragon still sat in the cockpit of his ship. He was the New Berlin system flying past the trade lane between the Brandenburg Border Station and the jump gate to Dresden. Getting into New Berlin was hard. After the patrol he destroyed he met a Universal Shipping convoy at the jump gate in Stuttgart and after their untimely demise he jumped through straight into a battle between the police and the Red Hessians. He ran from them and was now heading for the jump hole to Sigma-13. &quot;This is Red Hessian Silver Six you are unregistered and I assume you were banished who has your allegiance?&quot; &quot;Your enemies. But I'm fleeing to their enemies who are your enemies and who are neutral to your only allies.&quot; &quot; Come again.&quot; Said the stupid Hessian. &quot;Fine.&quot; Said Dragon amused. &quot;My enemies, enemies are my allies enemies and also my friends.&quot; The Red Hessian attacked him, stupid Hessian. &quot;The Outcastes Idiot.&quot; Said Dragon annoyed. When the Hessian didn't stop. &quot;Fine then eat screamers.&quot; &quot;Eat wha&#8230;&quot; the bemused Red Hessian didn't get a chance to finish as twenty screamers slammed into him. &quot;What was that now?&quot; He thought. &quot;Let&#8217;s see the kill list, two navy one Hessian two Universal Shipping escorts and one Universal Shipping Train. Man Rhienland&#8217;s really fallen.&quot;
<br />
<br />hopefully i can get up to the fight scene next time.</div>

			<div class="content">I stop visiting this site for two weeks and the moment i decide to post more of my shamefully long story its down. Anyway enough of boreing rants i got alot done but i'm still not up to the big fight yet. This is the second Fanfic i've started and i the other one was way shorter.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Hi Jake I'm Mike. Since your new to this unit I'm going to tell you the situation. When we arrived here roughly seventy-five years ago this system was populated by a race you call the Nomads. These were what we call civilian Nomads who fly fighters and patrol in groups of four. One year ago that changed. Those idiot Rhienlanders found a planet and awoke what we call military Nomads and they had Battleships, Cruisers, Gunboats and literally hundreds of fighters. We couldn&#8217;t find the planet but we did find a huge sphere and we believe that, if it could be penetrated, we could find a Nomad base bigger then a planet. We weren't strong enough to attack so we just sat here and defended. The problem was that this system was now populated with these military Nomads and we couldn't force them back. In a last ditch effort we attacked the planet above the sphere but all we did was destroy some small bases nothing important. When we had completed a new carrier and had finished outfitting the ANS Yamato carrier we decided to attack, but they hit first. Twenty carriers fifty cruisers and uncountable Gunboats and fighters, we didn't stand a chance. But just as we were about to retreat, something happened. The Battleships got sucked away by something and the same thing happened to the Cruisers, most of the Gunboats and half the fighters. The remaining Gunboats fled to be hunted down to the last later and half the remaining fighters went with them. A few fighters stayed and fought on but most of them just blew up. Anyway while we were up here the same thing happened in the second Unknown system. Nomad ships big and small were assaulting two planets. Primas and Gammu, and we couldn't do anything. One pilot single handily killed two Battleships and twelve fighters then flew into the sphere and killed another twenty before getting destroyed this pilots codename was Dragon.&quot; &quot;What.&quot; Interrupted Jake. &quot;Dragon, Why did you know him?&quot; Asked Mike. &quot;He was, um, how do I put this, banished for trying to kill me. His registration was deleted so everyone would know that he was banished.&quot; There was a pause then Mike said. &quot;What did he do to warrant such a dismissal?&quot; &quot;He almost blew up half of Planet Manhattan to get me.&quot; Answered Jake. &quot;Oh, why did he want to do that?&quot; &#8220;That&#8217;s personal.&quot; Said Jake.
<br />
<br />All the news that's fit for you this is the colony news service.
<br />&quot;This is Melinda Hawk reporting live from Stuttgart were strange unidentified ships have destroyed the Konstanz Border Station and bombed Planet Baden Baden. No survivors have been detected but some convoys escaped. What, oh okay, I've just got reports that they're evacuating Planet Stuttgart this is Melinda Hawk signing off.
<br /> This Alan Bush reporting from New Berlin were a Universal shipping convey didn't make it. The convoy was found near the Stuttgart-New Berlin jump gate destroyed but not looted. A Tracker named Andre Simmons found a Red Hessian fighter destroyed. He noted that nothing was taken from the wreckage.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Luke Moore with the Alliance Conflict News December 26 3324. The Coalition has moved into Sol and has taken Pluto, Neptune and Uranus; all attempts to halt them have failed. Even worse are reports that the Coalition has invaded The Sirius Sector and wiped out the Omicron Gamma, Omicron Theta, lower Unknown, Omega-41, Omega-11, Omega-7, Dresden and Stuttgart systems. Scans in the upper Unknown system have revealed a Nomad Outpost. This threat must be destroyed if the alliance is to retreat to the Sirius Sector.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hay, are you Trent?&quot; asked a man. &quot;Yeah. What of it.&quot; Trent was in a bad mood he was bored, in debt and had a hangover. &quot;Jun'ko Zane sent me to find you. Something about a two million credit job in Rhienland.&quot; &quot;What!&quot; exclaimed Trent. &quot;Man two million this could solve everything except the hangover.&quot; &quot;Met her on New Berlin.&quot; Said the man. &quot;I'll be there.&quot; Promised Trent.
<br />
<br />Yanagi Depot is in the middle of a nebular, surrounded by Junkers who would like nothing more then to steal his ship and it's filled with Corsairs who say he abandoned them but on the bright side it sold cheap beer. He'd been there for a little over two weeks but the seven corpses he'd left in a couple of cargo containers told him it was time to leave. Getting to Yanagi was easy, getting to Omicron Alpha won't be. The course he would take led him through Sigma-19, Omicron Beta and finally Omicron Alpha. The GMG didn't like him and he was going past two of their bases, so heavy fighting was likely all the way to Omicron Beta. Once there, he would stop off at Ruiz Base for a couple of days and finally head to Omicron Alpha and Planet Malta. He blasted off; there were no enemies so the Junkers hadn&#8217;t found their friends, yet. On the way to the jump hole a Junker patrol suddenly turned red and attacked. &quot;Chalk up another on the enemies list.&quot; Thought Dragon as he despatched them. Three GMG patrols later he was at the Gas Miner Naha. &quot;I'll cloak, if they find me it's to the death.&quot; Warping to a jump hole he saw once every week was one thing; warping to a jump hole he'd never seen before in a system littered with ship wrecks and exploding gas pockets is another. Luckily he made it past, and one GMG patrol later he was outside the jump hole. &quot;Damn.&quot; He thought. &quot;I'm almost out of missiles I'll have to be more careful.&quot; He straightened up and jumped.
<br />
<br />I thought i wrote more then that. I mite not get to the fightin my next post becouse of this anoying writers block problem i've been suffering. And i would liketo thank spellcheck for making this story possible.

			<div class="content">I dont understand it said you must massacure three virgins on a full moon, wait, Its alive i did it and they told me id never sell my soul for anything ill... the rest of this sentance has been destroyed in the interest of presurving your sanity please read the story after the beep&quot;beep&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir are you completely sure about this?&quot; Asked Nicoli. &quot;Of course I am every things ready so there's no point in backing out now.&quot; Answered Ivan Petrov. &quot;My fighter?&quot; &quot;Ready but.&quot; Nicoli paused then continued. &quot;I think you should send a wing to destroy the Luxury Liner Hawaii. It could send a distress call and any help would attack us on sight.&quot; &quot;Good thinking.&quot; Said Ivan. &quot;We can spare a wing. Also send a wing to silence any GMG incursions.&quot; &quot;It will be done sir.&quot; As he said this he turned around to walk out only to find another man walking in. &quot;Sir he has arrived.&quot; Said the man. &quot;Good lets move now.&quot; Said Ivan as he started walking to his fighter as his mind turned to revenge.
<br />
<br />&quot;I know we have a new guy but he doesn&#8217;t need our life story.&quot; The girl who said this was sitting in a corner so no one could see her. &quot;Because, Asp, I'm waiting for the update I requested, and it's ready. Okay every body listen up. You were meant to attack the Nomad outpost. Your new target is the Coalition Super Carrier Pharaoh. Tanner you&#8217;ll be flying in Asps wing, the Death Knights.&quot; &quot;What!&quot; said Asp and Jake simultaneously. &quot;She'll kill me.&quot; He'll get himself and my wing killed.&quot; &quot;Stop.&quot; Said Mike. &quot;His going and he'll live to tell the tail Asp. Jake she only sent that caption to hospital she didn't kill him. Now shut up.&quot; Mike turned toward everyone else. &quot;You'll warp to Sigma-17, just outside the jump gate. Use that to get to Sigma-19.&quot; &quot;Why not just warp to Sigma-19.&quot; Interrupted someone. &quot;Because once in Sigma-19 you'll move to the Luxury Liner Hawaii. If you warp they will be suspicious. Now once at the Hawaii you'll request back up and move to the gap between the two Nebular clouds. Then you'll meet up with the Pirates and the Hornets and attack the Pharaoh. We don't know why they're there and I don't want to know. Make sure there all dead especially Ivan Petrov.&quot; &quot;What.&quot; Said Jake. &quot;He's dead he must be, it's been a thousand years.&quot; Mike grimaced and said. &quot;It was in the battle against the Coalition's forward command centre, five years after the sleeper ships launched, in the year 2313. A section had launched off and the legendary Klaus Steiner had blown off the armour surrounding its core by flying into it and ejecting. The legendary man codenamed Draco blew away the core destroying the section and a nanny ship was flying to pick up Steiner. It was then that Ivan jumped in to kill Steiner. Draco flew in and killed two Black Guard before going after Ivan. The fight between the two lasted an hour but the other black guard where dead, as was the nanny. Finally Draco cut his pulled a 180-degree turn and fired three raptors straight into the cockpit of Ivan's fighter. We picked up Steiner and left but Ivan was picked up, alive. They cryogenically froze him till they had the technology revive him.&quot; &quot;No its not possible.&quot; Said Jake. &quot;It is. Now set up everybody you leave A.S.A.P.&quot; When Mike finished saying this he walked over to Asp said something to her and left. Jake chose a Shifter with four Eagle pods and a Howler pod, then walked out.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tell me again why where meeting on a Gas Miner while Rhienland's getting invaded.&quot; Complained Trent. &quot;Because Trent, that man where after is here in this system.&quot; Explained Juni. &quot;How can you be sure Juni?&quot; asked Trent &quot;Four GMG patrols have gone missing, the last one was five minutes ago. The deaths are moving steadily toward the Sigma-19 jump hole. If we hurry we can cut him off before he leaves the nebular in that system.&quot; &quot;Fine lets go.&quot; Said Trent. &quot;Wait there has been some major activity up there and so we've got three GMG wings backing us up.&quot; Said Juni. &quot;Good we&#8217;ll need some help.&quot; &quot;Mr Trent, Juni its good to see you.&quot; &quot;Orillian?&quot; asked Trent. &quot;Yes I wish it was under better circumstances. The man you&#8217;re hunting is connected to the Nomads and we want to find out how.&quot; Said Orillian. &quot;But the Nomads are gone.&quot; Said Trent. &quot;Not all of them Mr Trent. Anyway King will meet us at the jump hole with the GMG and Order wings.&quot; Said Orillian as he walked out.
<br />
<br />All the news that's fit for you this is the colony news service.
<br />&quot;This is Melinda Hawk reporting live from New Berlin where the invaders have just destroyed The Ring and are moving on the planet. What began as the glories recapture of Frankfurt has tuned the system into a desperate escape rout. Bretonia has lost the Cambridge system and are evacuating the Dublin and Edinburgh systems. All we can do now is wait and hope that Liberty will hold and that we will live on. This is Melinda Hawk out&#8230;&quot;
<br />Transmission lost.
<br />&quot;Damn it there winning.&quot; Thought Dragon.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir the Hawaii and the Ogashawa have been destroyed.&quot; Reported Nicoli. &quot;Excellent, everyone, move out.&quot; Everyone left the briefing room.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't see the Hawaii.&quot; Said Jake. Asp cut in. &quot;Don't be an idiot. Look there's its engine, and look the bar, and I don&#8217;t want to know what that is.&quot; Jake laughed. &quot;I didn't know you had a sense of humour.&quot; &quot;I'm full of surprises. Lets get moving, the Hornets and the Pirates value punctuality not survivability.&quot; Asp sounded only a little annoyed at the destruction of the Hawaii.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wasn't the Ogashawa here?&quot; Asked Trent. &quot;It was. Could that guy be responsible for this, I mean so many wrecks and none of them looted?&quot; Said Juni, more then a little unnerved. &quot;No, look at the trade lane.&quot; Said Orillian. &quot;What trade lane.&quot; Said King. &quot;Exactly.&quot; Responded Orillian. &quot;He could have done it, to stop a retreat.&quot; Said Trent angrily. &quot;Then why not disable it. Besides&#8230;&quot; Orillian paused then continued. &quot;We would have caught up with him. How could he destroy so much single-handedly without us catching up? No, this looks like the work of the invaders. I bet if we flew along were the trade lane was we would find the nothing but debris were the jump gate used to be. I'm picking up some strange readings coming from outside the cloud we should go.&quot;
<br />
<br />next time my dad brakes the internet connection i'll flay him alive make a noose from his flesh and hang him with it. my apoligies for not getting this out sooner and for not learning how to spell without spell check.

			<div class="content">finaly i get acsess to the internet so that my story can continue.
<br />
<br />This was too weird. No GMG no patrols no Hawaii, nothing but strange readings on an intercept course with him. The famous Trent and some pals probably, he&#8217;d heard Trent was tracking him. &#8220;Well.&#8221; He thought. &#8220;I could use a good fight but I&#8217;m heavily out numbered so I&#8217;ll get out of this cloud.&#8221; Then he picked up some readings from the opposite side of the system and moving his way. Something was out there but it wasn&#8217;t made by the colonies of that he was certain. Suddenly he picked up something big on his scanners and left the cloud. One wing of Black Guard flew in from his left another from his right and two came from in front. Three wings of unidentified fighters warped in range. Five wings of colony fighters appeared behind him. &#8220;This is freelancer alpha 1#1 identify yourself?&#8221; Asked Trent. &#8220;Mr Trent I&#8217;m Jake the missing Bounty Hunter. I'm here to help if you&#8217;re trying to destroy this carrier.&#8221; &#8220;No I&#8217;m after that lone fighter.&#8221; &#8220;And I&#8217;m after you Trent.&#8221; Teased Dragon. &#8220;Dragon is that you I&#8217;m Jake.&#8221; &#8220;Who?&#8221; Asked Dragon. Suddenly a fighter blew up and three Howlers whizzed past Juni. &#8220;Kill now, talk later.&#8221; Proposed Dragon as he rolled and fired a Screamer into King. &#8221;Ivan Petrov to Black Guard kill the Shifters.&#8221; When he finished saying this he cloaked snuck up behind the Hornets wing leader decloaked and fired a whole Howler pod into him. Dragon cut his engines turned and fired a whole Screamer pod into a GMG destroying him. Trent shot at Dragon hit Ivan and had to pull some quick manoeuvres to survive. Juni fired at a Black Guard but he cloaked. King shot at Dragon but missed and had to dodge a stray Chaos missile. Dragon cloaked flew behind King and Decloaked and destroyed Kings fighter but missing the escape pod. Ivan flew in and killed King. &#8220;No, King.&#8221; Shouted Trent as he blew up a Shifter. Orillian almost blew up Nicoli but was forced to dodge Asp as she took down a GMG fighter. Jake dodged Ivan, Trent and Orillian then blew up an Order fighter. A GMG tagged his own friend and got blown up by Nicoli. Juni blew up the last Hornet but suffered some serious hull damage. Dragon killed the last GMG and focused on the Black Guard. The Pharaoh gunned down a Pirate and Death Knight. Asp took down an Order fighter and saw Juni. Two more wings of Black Guard launched off the Pharaoh just as Gamma One took down its shield generator. Ivan took down the last Order pilot and attacked Trent. Jake killed the last of the original Black Guard but almost blew up as Nicoli rammed into him. The last Pirates took down the Pharaohs turrets. Orillian took down the last Pirate and attacked the Black Guard. Asp decloaked behind Juni and blew her up. Trent tractored in her escape pod and fled with Orillian. Ivan took down the last Death Knight and flew at Jake. Dragon Finished off the Black Guard and attacked Nicoli. Nicoli dodged Asp and shot Jake in the destroying his fighter. Asp flew in and protected Jake long enough for him to be rescued by a Nanny. Dragon flew in behind Nicoli and fired the last of his Screamers into him blowing him up. Another wing of Black Guard launched off and joined the fray. A Nanny picked up Nicoli and retreated with Asp. &#8220;So Petrov it&#8217;s just you and me.&#8221; Dragon laughed into the comlink. &#8220;Not on your life Dragon. Decloak and close in.&#8221; Suddenly the wing that launched earlier decloaked and surrounded Dragon. &#8220;Perfect.&#8221; Said Dragon. &#8220;Just perfect. Alright, you win.&#8221; And with that, he ejected.
<br />
<br />Jake was sitting in a room with Asp and Mike. &#8220;We need to rescue him.&#8221; Demanded Jake. &#8220;No.&#8221; Yelled Asp, she paused to calm down then continued. &#8220;I lost my entire wing, plus two others. That thing&#8217;s just too well defended. I don&#8217;t want to lose three more wings to rescue one guy.&#8221; &#8220;Listen.&#8221; Said Jake. &#8220;Ivan Petrov, seven wings of Black Guard and the Pharaoh, the flagship of the Coalition fleet came after this guy. Hell Trent and the Order came after this guy and were willing to face us rather then lose him. Besides he didn&#8217;t attack us, only Trents group and the Coalition.&#8221; &#8220;Now listen.&#8221; Interrupted Mike. &#8220;He must be important for Trent and Petrov to come after him so we will not let him rot in a Coalition prison.&#8221; Jake blew a sigh of relief but Mike wasn&#8217;t finished yet. &#8221;However until we know why they want him we will wait.&#8221; &#8220;No, not now, not when I&#8217;m so close.&#8221; Jake whispered to himself. &#8220;Wait, I remember.&#8221; Said Asp. She got up walked around the table and grabbed Jake. &#8220;You, you knew him. Who is he?&#8221; Jake sighed then said. &#8220;Fine, fine, I didn&#8217;t want you to know but it seems I no longer have a choice. You know that guy that attacked the Nomad sphere by himself. Well he's alive and captive. He must of survived the Nomads because that was definitely him. Look at the skill he showed. A group called the Order were there and I don&#8217;t know why since they usually deal with keeping Nomads out of the colonies. As for Trent, well, when Dragon was first banished he left a huge trail of destroyed ships. Usually this goes unnoticed as long as the majority of those deaths are pirates, but he never looted them. The ship he had didn&#8217;t have a tractor beam built into it so he couldn&#8217;t. One of my first jobs was tracking him down but he was too efficient and made it to the Corsairs before we knew he&#8217;d left Rhienland. I haven&#8217;t been keeping up with the news reports but I&#8217;d say he's left another trail and Trent picked up on it. As for why Ivan wants him I cant, I wont tell you.&#8221; &#8220;What.&#8221; Yelled Asp. &#8220;Shut up that&#8217;s an order.&#8221; Commanded Mike. &#8220;It&#8217;s a free galaxy. Why do I have to tell you anything that I&#8217;m under no obligation to tell?&#8221; asked Jake. &#8220;Because if you don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll push out of the nearest airlock.&#8221; Yelled Asp. &#8221;Enough.&#8221; Commanded Mike but then the alert went off. &#8220;You will tell us but not now. I&#8217;ve got to go and get my orders; you&#8217;ll be flying with the Scorpions. There Coalition defects but there very loyal to the Alliance. There leader is a man called Logan, he&#8217;s American but worked with the Coalition for some time before his conscience caused him to lead his squad on a suicide run for our lines. Fortunately we arrived, ambushed them and then protected them till they made it to the front line. I was on the ship that ambushed them, we were hunting conveys at the time.&#8221; He ran to the door. &#8220;See you at the Briefing.&#8221;
<br />
<br />how the hell did i get that done. anyway you may have noticed the story lines been altered i did it for the sake of this story damn.

			<div class="content">well theres not much else to type exept enjoy (and no the story isnt selt as badly as my posts
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;re alive.&#8221; A relieved Trent said. &#8220;Of course, didn&#8217;t think a little thing like my eject pod barely surviving a fight could stop me did you.&#8221; Joked Juni. &#8220;I asked Orillian but he had no idea who or what those ships were. What we do know is that our thirty fighters were all destroyed only killing about four of the enemies. And&#8230;&#8221; Trent paused. &#8220;What?&#8221; Asked Juni. &#8220;Its King, he&#8217;s, dead.&#8221; Trent stoped for a moment so it could fully sink then continued. &#8220;We know who killed him. We intercepted a transmission from the killer, taunting just before he killed him.&#8221; &#8220;Who was it? The guy we were hunting?&#8221; asked Juni still shocked. &#8220;No, the guy was identified as Ivan Petrov. Thou the guy we were hunting destroyed Kings fighter it was this Ivan Petrov that destroyed his escape pod.&#8221; Trent took something out of a bag. &#8220; I thought you might want to see the transmission.&#8221; &#8220;Yes. Put it on.&#8221; Trent walked over to a machine called Holographic Projector and inserted a disk into it. &#8220;So the mighty King falls to the Dragon and the throne gets passed on to the next idiotic lap dog of the so called hero Trent. Your prey may have turned predator but it is I Ivan Petrov who will deliver the killing blow to you, to Trent, to the Order, to the Houses, to the Pirates and last of all to the Alliance. Know this as you die, lackey.&#8221; &#8220;That murderer. Were is he?&#8221; Junis voice shook with barely controlled anger &#8220;The ship he flew off was last seen entering Kappa-63.&#8221; Said Trent. &#8220;The forbidden Nomad system. You don&#8217;t think there allied with the Nomads do you?&#8221; Asked Juni as her anger was met with amazement and curiosity. &#8220;There are no Nomads, at least not anymore.&#8221; It was Orillian. &#8220;You&#8217;re alive.&#8221; Said Juni &#8220;No need to sound so disappointed miss Zane.&#8220; Joked Orillian. &#8220;What&#8217;s the story Casper?&#8221; asked Trent. &#8220;Not good, the Nomads have been completely wiped out as far as we know. The last sightings were in Omicron Alpha and in Kappa-63 next to a strange jump gate. Oh and Mr Trent that message upload the password destiny into it.&#8221; &#8220;What about Dragon thou, what do you know about him?&#8221; asked Trent. &#8220;Nothing, no one knows who he is.&#8221; Responded Orillian more then a little worried. &#8220;Excuse me who&#8217;s Dragon.&#8221; Interrupted Juni. &#8220;Our target.&#8221; Said Trent angrily. Juni swore.  &#8220;What wrong?&#8221; asked Trent. &#8220;Dragon was banished from the houses when he almost destroyed half of Planet Manhattan.&#8221; Moaned Juni. Trent walked over to the Holographic Projector and uploaded the password. &#8220;Mister Trent you found it I&#8217;m so glad. Dragons&#8217; destiny wont matter anymore but his life wasn&#8217;t the only thing I wanted in this place. In twenty-four hours the Dyson Sphere will blow up. Don&#8217;t worry the set of jump coordinates that were in a Don Kavosh ruin are in my hands so there is nothing else important there. I&#8217;m sending this to you so that you come to the Epsilon systems. Since I would hate it if you stayed away because of fear I&#8217;m sending this to you. When the war was still reasonably young Dragon was known as Drake a simple volunteer in a war filled with hopelessness, he killed a lot of important leaders and almost won the war. He vanished along with the French and five of our best saboteurs but by that point he had killed Admiral Kulov, my brother Nicoli, the Red Dragon, left me for dead and killed my father. It was on the French sleeper ship that Dragon gained his new name. They were on schedule until the Saboteurs started doing their thing. They changed the flight path so the ship would never make it to the colonies then they set small and heavy explosives around the place. Dragon, Moose and Steiner woke up and set themselves to the task of saving the ship. Moose, Dragons co-pilot disarmed most of the bombs but couldn't find the final two. Steiner and Dragon were taking down the Saboteurs themselves and during that task one almost put a bit of plasma in dragons head, that was when Moose saved him and Dragon swore to pay back that debt, taking the gun that almost cost him his life. Steiner found largest bomb and disarmed it while Dragon killed the second last Saboteur. Into the final room they walked weapons at their side, at least until the last bomb went off and blew Moose into the wall and Dragon and Steiner back through the door. The Last Saboteur walked forward carrying a large metal pipe and cursing the Alliance. Steiner in all of his stupidity shut and locked the door. Moose got up and charged the leader of the Saboteurs, knocking him into the wall and making him drop the pipe, picking it up he let out a yell and smashed his enemies&#8217; neck. Moose walked over to the door and tried to open it, only to find it was jammed and not feeling very obliged to open. Dragon hacked the security computer only to find that the door had jammed in the closing sequence. Moose gave up and tried to fix the flight path but could only correct it not fix it, meanwhile Dragon vowed to hunt down Jake Tanner A.K.A. Klaus Steiner and kill him with a certain gun. They made it to a strange system devoid of life where, strangely the auto wake didn&#8217;t kick in. They sat there for a couple of centuries until a group of Outcasts came by and woke them up and in the chaos of the battle Jake escaped. Dragon almost killed him on Manhattan but was stoped. Oh before I forget some of the ships you fought were the Alliances. Good luck.&#8221; Ivans&#8217; voice died. &#8220;Too much, going to bed.&#8221; Winced Trent.
<br />
<br />Dragon saw his one opportunity and took it. Killing four men taking their guns then barricading him-self in a supply room had seemed a good idea at the time but he could use some data. Plans, schematics, messages and hell even the average climate of Iraq back on Earth would be more useful then what he had at the moment. He was about to start longing the days when you got annul probed with tracers when he had an idea, the ventilation. He&#8217;d crawled past the next room when he heard an explosion. &#8220;So they have a self-destruct sequence, marvellous.&#8221; Thought Dragon. He found a room with no guards and a computer that looked promising, smashed the vent and fell out of it ever so gracefully. &#8220;What the hell is wrong with this connection.&#8221; He thought angrily as he downloaded a virus. He then checked the files for anything of use and found a couple of Funniest Home Videos episodes from the year 3114 and the schematics to whole ship. He finished downloading the schematics onto a disk when he found out he didn&#8217;t have enough space. Mustering all of his inner strength he deleted the Funniest Home Videos episodes. He checked the schematics one last time, found what he wanted, got back into the vent and preceded to Ivans&#8217; quarters. He jumped out of the vent and pointed his gun at Ivan. &#8220;Why bother shooting I&#8217;ll just get revenge in a couple of years. It must be so frustrating to miss your shot at finishing the family.&#8221; Said Ivan in a calm slow voice. &#8220;I never tried to kill your family. In-fact they were just a footnote in my life story.&#8221; Taunted Dragon. &#8220;Then what have you devoted your life to wiping out?&#8221; Asked Ivan. &#8220;Three thing: Taxi drivers, the French and Leprechauns.&#8221; Said Dragon in utter degust. &#8220;Oh Leprechauns, I now feel so safe and secure while in your custody.&#8221; Said Ivan more then a little worried. &#8220;I hate the little ****s. Anyway what shall I ask you? What the hell are plans? What part do I play in them? Where&#8217;s Jake? Oh and why do you have a Nomad in your prison?&#8221; Asked Dragon. &#8220;Well my plans are quite complicated so I&#8217;ll start with your part in them. You are insignificant and your death would mean little because of that you can do anything, so basically you are the one thing that I cannot control and that makes you more dangerous then the Alliance, the Nomads and even the houses. Trent I can get following my trail like a dog, the Alliance will blunder into anything they think they understand and Jake will blunder into any situation that could earn him forgiveness. This isn&#8217;t a storybook; there are no divine prophesise or heroic destinies, just choices and situations. I have no plan for you and that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t kill you, if I met another person like you I&#8217;d know how to deal with them. Trent is still after answers and could be useful, and the Alliance wont risk coming after us. But now comes the best part, my main plan. Not long after you left the alliance stumbled across, something on Earth and smuggled it of the planet in parts. It was beautiful and powerful, destroying entire technologies by permanently shifting them into another dimension. It could choose different dimensions so the alliance chose one were nothing existed and anything that entered it would slowly disintegrate. With this weapon they won the war and set both sides back a couple of hundred years technologically, but then it arrived. It was huge and alien and unique and had its sights set on our sun. We were powerful but confined to one system and there was only one way they could defeat us. Yet they had a weapon that would serve its purpose. Regaining our wits we attacked it united and were beating it, but not fast enough. Finally the alliance shot it with the Eraser Cannon System or E.C.S. for short. You never fought that terror so you don&#8217;t know its fury, someone was sent to warn you, the Coalition moved out of Sol and the Alliance fired the E.C.S. on itself destroying it and every other one from existence, at least that&#8217;s what they thought. It seems the Nomads had something that could save one E.C.S. It shifted everything within a certain radius into another dimension but it was only temporary and they soon had it back.&#8221; &#8220;Then why not use it?&#8221; interrupted Dragon &#8220;Because.&#8221; Continued Ivan. &#8220;They are the protectors, the keepers and they couldn't fix it. The Nomad prisoner told us that there are only about fifty Nomads guarding it instead of the usual five hundred. Someone knew the Nomads well enough to create a virus that has forced them to withdraw every fighter, gunboat and battleship to the Epsilon-13 system. Now is the time for me to strike, capture the E.C.S. and wipe the Nomads from existence.&#8221; Ivan paused to listen to something then said. &#8220;Well our time is almost up so if you&#8217;ll put the gun down and back away I&#8217;ll let you live.&#8221; &#8220;Interesting deal.&#8221; Said Dragon as he walked over to the door. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve got a better one.&#8221; He started placing charges around the door. &#8220;I set the self destruct sequence in this room, we have three minutes left.&#8221; He placed the last charge. &#8220;I know this gun can&#8217;t hurt you because of the energy system used, but it can hurt them. I think I can hold them of for three minutes.&#8221; &#8220;What if they transmit the deactivation code for that gun?&#8221; asked Ivan. &#8220;Then I shoot you with these.&#8221; Said Dragon smirking as he took out a pair of sunglasses. &#8220;Oh great a clich&#233;, it&#8217;s the 36th century for god&#8217;s sake.&#8221; Moaned Ivan. &#8220;Shut up and listen and we&#8217;ll both get out of hear alive. I like your plan and so I&#8217;m prepared to help you until you wipe out the Nomads and in exchange you give me Steiner and more info.&#8221; When Dragon finished saying this he walked over to the door and the looked at the lock control panel. &#8220;Your terms are quite acceptable.&#8221; Said Ivan. &#8220;Good then I won&#8217;t trap us in here.&#8221; Dragon looked away at the panel then continued. &#8220;One last thing: once the Nomads are dead I will destroy that, that thing.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll see Dragon.&#8221; Said Ivan. He walked over to the door and opened it. &#8220;Men meet our newest ally.&#8221;

			<div class="content">A new computer later and ive finally caught up. Sorrey bout the paragraphs ill fix that next story. however considering my liflong ambition is to wipe out the human race a little cattarax isnt that bad
<br />
<br />All the news that&amp;#8217;s fit for you this is the colony news service.
<br />&quot;This is Nathan Clarke reporting live from Akita Border Station in the Honshu system were three simultaneous attacks have crushed our defences and our hope. One came from through the Chugoku jump hole and has destroyed the Kansai Research Station and then the Yukawa Shipyard. The second came through the Sigma-19 jump gate and has destroyed it, Aomori Station and everything on planet Honshu. The last appeared next to the New Tokyo jump gate destroying it they moved on to the Osaka Storage Facility and will soon move in on us. I just got a report saying that another force has come through the Sigma-13 jump gate. This Nathan Clarke out.&quot; &quot;This is the New Berlin resistance transmitting. We are fighting and will not surrender. Our enemy is the Coalition we have identified them and have beaten them back. Remember we can fight back we can resist we can win this war.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So why the alert&quot; demanded Asp. Mike pressed a few buttons on a keypad then said. &quot;Nicoli finally talked. All we had to do was tell him that you would be talking to him and with the prospect of facing your charming attitude he told us everything we wanted.&quot; The screen next on the wall flicked into life and at the same time a man walked. &quot;He'd obviously heard of your wonderful personality and way with words.&quot; &quot;Are Logan so nice of you to grace us with your presence and glittering social skills.&quot; Said Asp sarcastically. &quot;Anytime anywhere Asp. So this must be Steiner.&quot; &quot;Is he supposed to know about that?&quot; asked Jake. &quot;No&quot; replied Mike. Logan walked over to a seat, shoved a guy off it, sat down and said. &quot;I've got good informants. Now the briefing.&quot; &quot;Yes the briefing.&quot; Said Mike. The screen showed three purple triangles move to a jump hole and disappear. &quot;Every Nomad in this system has fled to this jump hole which according to Nicoli leads to Kappa-63. He also said that the Jump hole appeared at exactly the same time as the one in Kappa-32 and that there&amp;#8217;s someone else out there.&quot; The screen changed to a map of Sirius that showed how the invasion was going. Bretonia had lost Cambridge, Dublin, New Manchester and Edinburgh. Kusari had lost Chugoku, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Tohoku and most of New Tokyo. Rhienland had lost everything except a few resistance groups on the planets Stuttgart and New Berlin. Liberty hadn&amp;#8217;t lost anything yet. The only other systems not under Coalition control were Omicron Alpha, the top Unknown system and Epsilon-6, 18 and 24. &quot;The Corsair-Outcast alliance has fought off the Coalition so far but it wont hold for long so the Vanguard and three fighter wings will go to reinforce them. The Hispania alliance will then move down to Kusari and force the Coalition into a stalemate.&quot; The screen changed to map of the New Tokyo system. Two big blue triangles and six little blue ones moved to three big red ones and ten little red ones.  Six of the red triangles disappear and the remaining red triangles pulled back. Three little blue triangles and one big blue triangle moved in as the blue triangles come back all the red triangles disappear. &quot;The Vanguard will then trap the Coalition force and destroy them. Both sides will take heavy loses but we will show the houses that they can fight back.&quot; The screen went blank. &quot;We will fly to the Kappa-63 jump hole and from there to the Epsilon-16 jump hole. We don't know anything about ether of these systems so there&amp;#8217;s no Intel on what's in store for us. We do know that the Order were completely forced out of these systems so there's no backup once were there. We don't expect much resistance once were there as a large portion of the Coalitions forces are conquering the houses and the rest are guarding the other Kappa systems.&quot; Suddenly an alarm went off. &quot;Proximity alert house ships have jumped in.&quot; &quot;Damn.&quot; Said Jake. &quot;Computer, what kind?&quot; &quot;The ships have been identified as belonging to the Order.&quot; Jake swore but Mike said. &quot;This could work to our advantage Jake, Asp and Logan take the rest of the Scorpions and launch I'll join you in space.&quot;</div>
