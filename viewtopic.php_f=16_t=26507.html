			<div class="content">PART 1
<br />
<br />Every business require some money to be invested. What sum of money you have
<br />to have, depends on your strategic choice. Because my way to become rich is
<br />based on cargo trading, I bought a freighter ship with lots of cargo space.
<br />
<br />If you have $62,820 buy Dromedary. It have 275 of cargo space and can be
<br />found at Mactan Base in Magellan System. Shield capacity is somewhat low
<br />(3600) and number of shield batteries/nanobots is 23. Note the base is owned
<br />by Lane Hackers, so you have to have good reputation to dock at their base.
<br />If your reputation isn't good enough (below neutral), try looking for some
<br />person in bars who can hack it for you. But be warned, the price is high!
<br />
<br />The alternative to Dromedary ship is Humpback. It have 250 of cargo space,
<br />shield capacity of 5800 and number of shield batteries/nanobots is 33. So, at
<br />cost of 25 cargo space it have much stronger shield capacity and more shield
<br />batteries/nanobots than Dromedary. But the price is not low. For $170,940 it
<br />can be found at the following locations:
<br />
<br />  SYSTEM   /   PLANET   /  FACTION
<br />------------------------------------
<br />Tau-31     / Harris     / Planetform
<br />Frankfurt  / Holstein   / Daumann
<br />Hamburg    / Hamburg    / Police
<br />New Berlin / New Berlin / Police
<br />Stuttgart  / Stuttgart  / Police
<br />
<br />I would not recommend upgrading weapons too much, because cargo ships are not
<br />combat-style ships. Just buy something you can defend with, in case you spot
<br />some enemies. We're not here to spend money, we're here because of profit.
<br />Highly recommended is requiring Adv. Countermeasure Dropper and Rares because
<br />with the ship you bought, you will run away most of the time, and then comes
<br />time when enemies hit you with whatever they can. Without Countermeasures you
<br />won't get away because enemies have tons of Missiles and Cruise Disruptors.
<br />
<br />Now... hmmm... remember when I was talking that in every business you must
<br />have to invest something? Yes, more money! I gues you have a few bucks left?!
<br />$100,000 would be ideal, but you can do it even with $1,000. It's better to
<br />buy more stuff and fill the cargo space to full, because you will gain profit
<br />at a much faster rate than with $1,000. Hard to explain, but believe me, the
<br />more money you have, the better your business will go. 
<br />
<br />Shortly speaking, you will have to buy one good at some place, sell it to the
<br />buyer at the other place, and on the way back do the same thing with some
<br />other commodity at different locations, but on the same path (same
<br />waypoints). So, when you return the the place you start at, you will have
<br />your profit doubled! Ship's cargo space will be as efficient as it can be, it
<br />will be empty only small part of the whole way. The route is really a golden
<br />route!!! It's somewhat long (about 40 minutes for both ways), but believe me,
<br />it pays off. Here's the whole trade procedure and some math (with Dromedary):
<br />
<br />1. Buy Niobium at Planet Kyushu, Kyushu System
<br />   275 x $415 = $114,125
<br />2. Sell Niobium at Leipzig Station, Dresden System
<br />   275 x $1,600 = $440,000
<br />
<br />So if you calculate, your profit is $325,875 !!! ... not bad <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />On the way back visit these places:
<br />
<br />3. Buy Diamonds at Bautzen Station, Dresden System
<br />   275 x $330 = $90,750
<br />4. Sell Diamonds at Planet New Tokyo, New Tokyo System
<br />   275 x $1,650 = $453,750
<br />
<br />If I'm right, your profit is $363,000 !!! ... what about this?
<br />So when you sum all this together, your total profit is:
<br />
<br /> $325,875
<br />+$363,000
<br /> --------
<br /> $688,875 (now that's called real money!)
<br />
<br />And all of this in 40 minutes. Repeat this a couple of times and buy Titan
<br />ship, torpedoes, missiles, mines and all other kick-ass weaponary! And you
<br />ask why?! Why all this when you have trainers for the game and save game
<br />decoders? Well, I hate cheating and it also ruins the gameplay. My way, you
<br />have much more fun and challenge from the game, than freezing shield/power
<br />values, money cheating and killing whatever you see. Blah! Leave that alone!

			<div class="content">PART 2
<br />
<br />Just to mention, if you plan to buy Dromedary ship (Magellan System), then go
<br />to Kyushu System first and buy Niobium, because you'll get faster there than
<br />to Dresden System where you buy Diamonds. And if you plan to buy Humpback and
<br />want to trade with Niobium, then buy this ship in Tau-31 System (you must go
<br />through one system only). But if you want to buy Diamonds then go to
<br />Stuttgart, New Berlin or Hamburg Systems first to buy Humpback, buy Diamonds
<br />in Dresden System, and after you sell them, go for the Niobium at Planet
<br />Kyushu in Kyushu System, and repeat this as many times as you want.
<br />
<br />For those who don't know how to get from Planet Kyushu to Leipzig Station,
<br />here are all the waypoints. Note that you have to finish the game (destroy
<br />the Nomad Shield Generator), or some places won't be accessible. When you
<br />find locations from waypoint 1,2,3 and 4, don't request Set Best Path from
<br />the game, as it will make 47 waypoints! You could go this way, but it takes
<br />much longer! With a location of a jump hole I'll write below, you will cut
<br />your trip by 11 waypoints! FreeLancer makes waypoints through New Berlin and
<br />Frankfurt Systems, which is unneccessary. Even when a jump hole is charted on
<br />the map, FreeLancer can't see it and generates &quot;Best Path&quot; over again.
<br />
<br />This is a short version (for those who know FreeLancer universe):
<br />1. Planet Kyushu (Kyushu System) -&gt; New Berlin Jump Hole (Sigma-13 System)
<br />   (24 waypoints)
<br />2. Sigma-13 Jump Hole (New Berlin) -&gt; Leipzig Station (Dresden System)
<br />   (12 waypoints, don't use Set Best Path on Leipzig Station as FreeLancer
<br />   will make a waypoint to Planet New Berlin - just use trade line to
<br />   Brandenburg Border Station which is 5.4K from the jump hole)
<br />
<br />This is a longer version (for those who get disoriented):
<br />01. Planet Kyushu (Kyushu System) -&gt; New Tokyo Jump Gate, Sector 3E, 44.7K
<br />02. Kyushu System -&gt; New Tokyo System, Sector 3G
<br />03. Kyushu Jump Gate -&gt; Shinjuku Station, Sector 5B, 37.2K
<br />04. Shinjuku Station -&gt; Planet New Tokio, Sector 5C, 59.7K
<br />05. Planet New Tokyo -&gt; Shinagawa Station, Sector 6D, 52.1K
<br />06. Shinagawa Station -&gt; Honshu Jump Gate, Sector 5F, 52.2K
<br />07. New Tokyo System -&gt; Honshu System, Sector 4G
<br />08. New Tokyo Jump Gate -&gt; Osaka Storage Facility, Sector 5B, 67.2K
<br />09. Osaka Storage Facility -&gt; Akita Border Station, Sector 6D, 62.7K
<br />10. Akita Border Station -&gt; Sigma-13 Jump Gate, Sector 5F, 37.1K
<br />11. Honshu System -&gt; Sigma-13 System, Sector 6F
<br />12. Honshu Jump Gate -&gt; Gas Miner Naha, Sector 2C, 22.1K
<br />13. Gas Miner Naha -&gt; Helgoland Station, Sector 4D, 29.6K
<br />14. Helgoland Station -&gt; New Berlin Jump Hole, Sector 6D, 20.6K
<br />15. Sigma-13 System -&gt; New Berlin System, Sector 5C
<br />16. Sigma-13 Jump Hole -&gt; Brandenburg Border Station, Sector 5E
<br />    (use trade line which is 5.4K from the jump hole), 5.4K+29.7K=35.1K
<br />17. Brandenburg Border Station -&gt; Dresden Jump Gate, Sector 6D, 44.6K
<br />18. New Berlin System -&gt; Dresden System, Sector 7D
<br />19. New Berlin Jump Gate -&gt; Bautzen Station, Sector 2E, 29.7K
<br />20. Bautzen Station -&gt; Pirna Border Station, Sector 4F, 22.1K
<br />21. Pirna Border Station -&gt; Leipzig Station, Sector 6E -&gt; Sector 6C, 29.7K
<br />22. Say: &quot;This will be a fat retirement!&quot; (it doesn't work without this <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />
<br />You may ask yourself why these two versions don't have the same number of
<br />waypoints? In the first version, Set Best Path option is used, where
<br />FreeLancer makes waypoints from end of one trade line to beginning of another
<br />trade line (tipically approx. 1.5K). I didn't find it so important so I
<br />didn't include those waypoints in other (longer) version. Both versions are
<br />the same, except the second version is more detailed. All in all, you will
<br />find the right path, just follow the procedure.
<br />
<br />All you have to do is bypass Frankfurt System and Planet New Berlin, because
<br />they take a lot of extra time. You should use Sigma-13/New Berlin jump holes
<br />in both ways. When you are returning to Planet Kyushu for more Niobium don't
<br />forget to buy Diamonds at Bautzen Station and sell them on Planet New Tokyo.
<br />
<br />The total K's you must pass from Planet Kyushu to Leipzig Station is 646.4K,
<br />not including K's between trade lines. So, it's slightly over 650K. For every
<br />K (it's funny, is it kilometer or what?) you pass, you got more than $500.
<br />Would you walk 1 kilometer and be payed $500? Man, I would walk all the time!
<br />
<br />There are also a few other ways to get to some waypoints using other jump
<br />holes (like the one from Chugoku System -&gt; Sigma-13 System), but that ways
<br />are not very safe, expecially with cargo ships. Imagine you have Dromedary
<br />ship and 9 Corsairs with Titan ships are firing on you with level 8 weapons,
<br />Missiles and Cruise Disruptors - no way you can escape them, they only want
<br />your Niobium/Diamonds!
<br />
<br />So, that's it, folks! Hope my English wasn't so bad. If you know some other
<br />&quot;golden route&quot; or find some errors is this text, then email me at:
<br />

<br />
<br />UPDATE: (thanks to /-Entropy-/ and T-hawk)
<br />
<br />There's another, more profitable way of trading with Niobium, but do it on
<br />your own risk. It's much more safe to go as explained above. You can either
<br />by Niobium at Falkland Base (note that base is owned by IMG) for $160 a piece
<br />or mine it yourself around the base (just click on Minable Zones Map and see
<br />where you can mine it). Note that drop rate is almost 100%! Here are the
<br />waypoints:
<br />
<br />Planet Kyushu (Kyushu System) -&gt; Tsushima Depot, Sector 3E, 59.7K
<br />Tsushima Depot -&gt; Tau-23 Jump Hole, Sector 3D -&gt; Sector 4B, 43.3K
<br />  (you can use trade line to Tau-29 Jump Gate to shorten your trip to Tau-23
<br />  Jump Hole, because it's almost on the same path; just press 'F' key (free
<br />  flight) to get off the trade line when you're close to Tau-23 Jump Hole)
<br />Kyushu Jump Hole -&gt; Tau-37 Jump Hole (Sector 2E), 19.6K
<br />Tau-23 Jump Hole -&gt; Falkland Base (Sector 6C), 9.9K
<br />
<br />When you bought or mined Niobium, you can go to Dresden System through
<br />Omicron and Omega Systems (faster) or you can go back to Kyushu System and
<br />follow the waypoints to Dresden System I wrote earlier (one more system to
<br />travel through).

			<div class="content">/-Entropy-/ -&gt; Well, I didn't know for that Niobum mine field, but if I did, I
<br />think I wouldn't go this way. Why? Today I bought Dromedary again and try to go
<br />your way - I failed! Much radiation, many hostiles, so much I can't even mine
<br />Niobium. The ship can't mount good weapons, so I can't defend myself. It's
<br />pretty bad out there. Niobium IS free to collect and IS 2,5 times cheaper than on
<br />Planet Kyushu, but what good of all that if you're DEAD?
<br />
<br />T-hawk -&gt; As I said to /-Entropy-/, there are too much hostiles for a freighter
<br />ship and I don't have enough money to fix my reps with the criminal factions.
<br />There ARE less waypoints, but when I buy Diamonds on the way back I must go
<br />through Sigma-13 to the Kusari space anyway. I will stick to my old &quot;flight-
<br />plan&quot; until I find some more profitable and better ways. I will post a message
<br />about buying and selling commodities, so maybe something else will come from that...
<br />
<br />Thanks anyway!
