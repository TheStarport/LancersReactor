			<div class="content">Chaos Theory Pt. 5: Enemies of Liberty
<br />
<br />   
<br /> Trent watched Juni disappear from his sight, before turning around in the slow- moving elevator. For the third time in his life, he was about to embark on a journey to save humanity, and he was actually starting to wonder if this was the final battle, like the battle of Armageddon predicted in the Bible in Revelation. When the elevator finally reached the landing bay, Trent climbed into his ship. When he launched, he saw the cold green- blue nebulae, the asteroids, and off in the distance he could see Prission Station Michell. Yet again, he was in the forbidden system, Alaska. He found the New York Jump gate on his nav map, and set a course. Behind him the Osiris cloaked, and Blanca came over the secure channel. &quot;The Osiris will stay cloaked until you get back with President Jacobi, just make sure you head back to this spot, we will uncloak and you can dock. Osiris out.&quot; Trent headed to the gate where he was encountered by two Liberty Battleships, the Wisconsin and the Idaho.
<br />
<br />&quot;Unidentified ship, this is the Battleship Wisconsin. You are ordered to cut your engines and prepare to be boarded. If you do not deactivate your engines within ten seconds, you will be terminated!&quot; Trent was getting tired of always having to identify himself to other people. He had saved all of their lives twice already. Twelve seconds passed and the Wisconsin and the Idaho opened fire. Trent dodged the torpedoes and fired his wave of lasers and missiles. He didn't need to use his torpedoes because human battleships were a lot weaker than Nomads. Trent had the Wisconsin totally destroyed and was now firing on the Idaho, when the Battleship Connecticut unlocked with Juneau shipyard.
<br />
<br />All of the sudden there were lasers all around him, and Nomads appeared on his scanners. &quot;This is just perfect!&quot; Trent said to himself. The Idaho and the Connecticut were destroyed by the first torpedo wave, and now they were after Trent. He managed to get through the jump gate just in time to see it destroyed. At least no Nomads could follow him now, he sped to New York.
<br />
<br />When Trent cleared the jump gate, the weapons platforms opened fire. They only had level 3 guns so they were no problem at all. Trent plotted a course for Battleship Rio Grande' that had just been recently stationed in New York, and headed for the trade lane. He got to Manhattan without any trouble, and docked. The landing was smooth and went off without a hitch. Trent's El Chupacabra approached the Presidential Palace where President Jacobi was waiting, and was warned by several LSF and LN ships to alter his course or he would be fired upon. 
<br />
<br />After Trent didn't turn away, they opened fire. &quot;Possible terrorist situation at the Presidential Palace. Send backup immediately. I repeat, possible terrorist ship in Presidential Palace airspace, need backup ASAP.&quot; A man said over the radio. Several ships were opening fire on him, but Trent didn't need to fire back, after all, Liberty ships were the weakest in all of Sirius. Trent picked up his Neural Net Communicator watch that he had laying on the console, and contacted Jacobi.
<br />
<br />&quot;President Jacobi, do you copy?&quot;
<br />&quot;Jacobi here, whats going on?&quot;
<br />&quot;I'm on my way to the pick-up point, but I'm having a nice little visit with your friends.&quot;
<br />&quot;They arn't attacking you are they?&quot;
<br />&quot;No, we just went to the admiral's place to have a cup of tea.&quot; Trent said sarcastically over the com. &quot;You think you could tell them to stand down? I don't want to hurt anybody if I don't have to.&quot;
<br />&quot;Negative, if anyone sees me leaving with you then they will know something's up. Is this transmission being tapped?&quot;
<br />&quot;My encryption is solid. To anyone listing in, this is nothing but a bunch of static. And I'm starting to get tired of the LSF clowns, so we might want to hurry up.&quot;
<br />&quot;Roger, meet me at the palace. I've given you the grand tour before, you know where my room is right?&quot;
<br />&quot;Be there as soon as I lose these clowns.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Trent flew out over the ocean, his plan was to go far out with the ships chasing him, cloak and fly back to the palace before anyone can get there. He dove underwater, with several ships following. After going about twenty miles under the water, Trent used his cloaking device. After emerging he flew straight to the palace.
<br />
<br />Trent flew toward the palace and hovered outside of Jacobi's window. She was startled by the loud noise, she walked over to her window to investigate. The window was open and Jacobi stuck her head out. When Trent saw this he raised up to the same level as the window and uncloaked. He motioned for her to jump in the cargo hold that had just opened, and she did. Trent cloaked again and sped off for the docking ring. He would have to uncloak to use it, and so he thought.
<br />
<br />If he used the docking ring and then cloaked, everyone would know that the Nomads had returned. He would have to fly back to the Osiris without a cloak.
<br />
<br />After Trent cleared the atmosphere he was hailed by the Battleship Rhode Island to surrender President Jacobi.  Word travels fast in Liberty  Trent thought to himself. He picked up the microphone and said &quot;Follow me and she dies!&quot; he threatened. But of course, he was not serous. Trent punched his cruise engines and flew straight to the deinse particle cloud on the far side of where Pittsburgh used to be. He knew that the New York Jump gate on the Alaska side was destroyed, but there was a jump hole just discovered about thirty minutes ago by the Liberty Rouges that would take him very close to the Osiris. After Trent jumped he saw several Nomad Battleships very near the Osiris. Trent cloaked before they saw him and flew to a secluded spot. &quot;Osiris, this is Trent. I have the president, there are several Nomads in the vicinity. Do not, I repeat do not respond to this transmission. They might be listening in, but they don't know our measurements of distance. I need you to meet me exactly 418k directly South of Prission Station Michell.&quot; Trent flew to the waypoint and waited. The Osiris uncloaked and before any of the Nomads could get there, he docked, and the Osiris cloaked again.
<br />
<br />&quot;Plot a course for Tohoku. Ryuku base, tell the Blood Dragons we are coming.&quot; Blanca ordered one of his pilots as Trent and Jacobi stepped into the bridge. Blanca turned to face Trent, and then Jacobi, he shook her hand and said &quot;Mad'am Jacobi, I'm sorry for all of this, but there are some things you need to know.&quot; Blanca and Jacobi stepped into another room. Juni walked over to Trent and kissed him on the cheek. As Blanca and Jacobi talked, Trent and Juni walked off to their quarters.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Ryuku base, this is Order Battleship Osiris, requesting to moore with your station over.&quot; The Osiris received clearance from Ryuku and docked. As everyone walked out into the lobby, they were approached by the manager. He asked what everyone needed and showed them to their quarters. There was an alarm, and the loudspeaker thundered. &quot;All personnel, evacuate the base now. All fighter pilots, to your ships. We have detected several Nomad Battleships headed for the base. I repeat, several Nomad Battleships detected.&quot; Trent and Juni headed for their ships, hoping for the best. They had to fight to clear a path so the other ships could escape. The Nomads had the base surrounded.
<br />
<br />
<br />End of Chaos Theory Pt. 5
<br />Next episode will be up soon.
<br />And I really hope you enjoyed the two episodes the other day, because it might not happen again.

			<div class="content">Chaos Theory Pt. 6: Corrupted
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;All personnel, evacuate the base now. All fighter pilots, to your ships. We have detected several Nomad Battleships headed for the base. I repeat, several Nomad Battleships detected.&quot; Trent and Juni rushed to their ships, hoping for some miracle. But as almost twenty Nomad Battleships came into view out of the port window of Ryuku base, the situation looked grim. As Trent and Juni climbed into their ships, a voice came over the Com. &quot;Colonel Trent, Mrs. Trent, we need you to protect the base at all costs. At least until we can get Jacobi out of here on the Osiris. Blanca out.&quot; They launched and were surrounded almost instantly by three Nomad Battleships. It was then that for the first time, Trent wondered how the Nomads were still here. But there was no time to think as he dodged several Nomad torpedo waves.
<br />
<br />&quot;All fighters, protect the Osiris at all costs. I repeat, defend the Osiris!&quot; Commander Blanca ordered. Trent had half of his shield drained in no time and was running out of batteries. The calm and oblivious computer voice came up, &quot;Shield failed. Batteries exhausted. Afterburners low. Fuel low. Power level critical.&quot; Trent was now starting to get very nervous, but he was more afraid of Juni being killed than losing his own life.
<br />
<br />Nomad Interceptors converged on the Osiris and began to fire their torpedoes. It began to explode, and Trent could see a small escape pod fly away just before the Osiris was smothered in the explosion. <i>Just hope that was Jacobi. </i> Trent thought when the computer came up again. &quot;Warning, Power level critical. Must recharge. Approximately three minutes of power left.&quot; there was a short pause. &quot;Electromagnetic interference detected, systems failer.&quot; Trent's ship went dead. He couldn't get any response from any of the Kusari Naval Cruisers that the Blood Dragons had hijacked, and he tried Juni. But before he could get the microphone to his mouth he saw her whiz by him with three interceptors in hot purist. They fired a wave of torpedoes, and Juni's ship went up in an amazing explosion. &quot;NOOOO! Juni!&quot;
<br />
<br />Out of his windshield he could see her escape pod being jettisoned from her ship, just in time to get away from the explosion. But then what Trent saw got him very confused. There were three Liberty Dreadnoughts engaging the Nomads. It was then that his ship was tractored up and instantly in a blinding flash of light, was in the massive cargo hold. He climbed out and surveyed the scene. Juni's escape pod appeared about twenty yards to his left, and he rushed over. He opened it to see her staring at him, with her eyes sparkling. They kissed and for what seemed like an hour, just stood there. 
<br />
<br />President Jacobi came walking up. &quot;Well, you two sure did a nice job of covering our butts!&quot; she said. &quot;We lost Blanca because of you. I sure hope your proud of your self. Because secretily, I kind of liked him.&quot; She turned to look at Juni, and then at the crew that was slowly making their way over to them. She walked away. After walking to a private room with one of the crew members, she returned. &quot;Well, I guess the Chansoler did get me when we were in Alaska.&quot; and her eyes began to give off the cold, evil blue glow. President Jacobi, the leader of Liberty, was one of the Nomads......
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />sorry this episode was kind of short, I didn't have much time at all today.
<br />Pt. 7 is coming soon. I don't know exactly when, but I hope it will be tomorrow afternoon.
<br />
<br />And also, I'm' not sure when this series will be done, but it will be shorter than the last one, you know, Captured. 
<br />
<br />But after that I will have another fanfic in the works.
<br />
<br />well i have to go now, so i will see you soon.</div>

			<div class="content">OK, I have not had a responce in this topic in almost four days. So did my fanfic just get to the point where it just sucks out loud? I'm not even sure If I should contue this one. And if I don't, then I have another one in the works that I hope you all will like, but I'm just wondering, should I contiue Chaos Theory or not??
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />sorry for double posting, but I don't have time to wait on someone to reply so here you go.
<br />
<br />sorry, this one is kind of short. But I still don't have much time. If you don't like the ending then let me know.
<br />
<br />
<br />Chaos Theory Pt. 7: Grim Reminder
<br />
<br />
<br />Jacobi's eyes started to have the evil, blue glow. She pulled out a gun and fired, just barely missing Trent's head. He ducked behind a pile of crates as Jacobi fired and hit Juni in the back, and she went down instantly.
<br />
<br />Jacobi turned and fired at Trent, but missed. He ducked behind six crates, as lasers blasted through them. He pulled out his gun and fired, hitting Jacobi in the shoulder. Trent continued to run behind the crates and came to a dead end. Oh hell!   Trent thought.
<br />
<br />He turned around to see Jacobi rushing up to him. Trent fired several times, hitting her with each one, but she still just kept coming. Trent fired another wave, hitting her in the face, but not slowing her down at all. She got within two feet of him, and picking him up with one arm and sliding him up against the wall, prepared to spread the Nomad seed.
<br />
<br />Her dark blue tongue stuck out of her mouth, and slowly moved toards his face, when she stopped, and fell to the ground, letting Trent go. It was then he realized what had just happened. A man that he didn't know had shot her in the back with his laser pistol, shattering her spine. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; the man said. &quot;If you mean if I'm still myself then yeh, thanks.&quot;
<br />
<br />The man, who's name tag said <b>Johnathan Faires. Fleet Admiral.    </b> holstered his weapon as Trent rushed over to Juni. &quot;You know, I really wanted to have kids.&quot; Juni managed to cough up, in between breaths. After about 20 seconds she began to cough up blood.
<br />&quot;I really did.&quot; Juni said again.
<br />&quot;Juni, don't talk like that. Your going to be fine, I can't lose you too.&quot;
<br />&quot;We all have to die Trent, this was just my time.&quot;
<br />&quot;Juni, don't die on me. Your going to be fine. It's all my fault. If I hadn't accepted that Ore shipment deal on Freeport 7 then you wouldn't be in this mess. I'm really sorry Juni.&quot;
<br />&quot;Don't be. It wasn't your fault. Trent, I love you. I guess I'll see you in Heaven.&quot; She said. Then her eyes closed.
<br />&quot;Juni, I told you, your going to be OK.&quot; there was a short pause. &quot;Juni?.......Juni?......... JUNIIII!&quot;

<br />
<br />Chaos Theory Pt. 8: Unknown Past Reveled
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />   Trent looked out of the window of the Liberty Battleship Isis, a tear streaming down his cheek. So far he had lost everyone important to him. It had been nearly three hours sense Juni had been killed and the personnel had taken her body away, and the pain he felt in his heart was unbearable. <i>She's really gone. This isn't a dream. She's really dead, and there's nothing I can do to bring her back.  </i>
<br />
<br />Trent was lost in thought when movement out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Two men came walking up to him, and stared. They looked so familiar, but Trent just couldn't think who they were. There was a tall man, with blond hair that came down to his eyes, and an Order-issued uniform. The other man wore the same outfit. The other man was about Trent's height, and looked to weigh about the same. His brown penetrating eyes looked scary, but gave a sense of warmth and safety. He had semi-dark skin and was bald, with a deep voice. 
<br />
<br />&quot;It's good to see that your still alive Mr. Trent.&quot; The blond man said, then looked over his shoulder at the shorter man.
<br />&quot;I guess he doesn't remember us.&quot; The dark-skinned man said. Then continued &quot;You remember me don't you?&quot; Trent just shook his head. Although he looked familiar, Trent just still couldn't figure out who it was. &quot;I believe the last time we saw each other was in New York, Buffalo base I believe.&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent was still confused, and then it came to him. &quot;O-O-Orillion? Casper Orillion?&quot; He stammered. The man just shook his head and smiled. Trent looked at the other man. &quot;Is that you, Colonel Kress?&quot; He asked. &quot;Its amazing what a little Dom Kavish research can do isn't it?&quot; replied Orillion
<br />
<br />Trent was confounded. He had watched Orillion die right in front of him, and Trent had killed Kress when he had been infested by a Nomad and attacked Juni. But they were dead. How is it that they were here? Trent was just too surprised to speak, and for the first time in almost four hours, forgot about what happened to Juni. &quot;If you want to know, then just come with us.&quot; Orillion said. Now feeling a little nervous, Trent did not object. He got up and followed the men down a dimly-lighted corridor.
<br />
<br />After walking for about five minutes in silence, they finally came to a conference room. Sitting at the table was Dr. Quintane and Sinclair. It had been a while sense Trent had seen ether one of them, and this was a pleasant surprise.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, Trent. Its been a long time, please, sit down.&quot; Quintane said, then pointed to a chair in the corner.
<br />&quot;Trent, there is not much time, so I will get directly to the point.&quot; Orillion said. &quot;Now Trent, I bet your wondering how it is that myself and Colonel Kress are still alive, isn't that right?&quot; Trent just nodded. He had been wanting to hear this ever sense he realized who the two men were, but had been too nervous to say anything.
<br />&quot;Well, thanks to our friends here,&quot; He tossed his head over in Sinclair and Quintain's direction, &quot; we were finally able to completely understand the mysterious artifact that Freeport 7 was destroyed for. You know the one I'm talking about. It seems that the artifact can store it's own records. We were able to decipher it, and what we found was amazing. I'm sure you have heard about the 23rd century war between the Coalition and the Alliance.&quot; Again, Trent just nodded. &quot;Near the end of the war, on the last day as-a-matter-of-fact, the Coalition prepared for one final assault against the Alliance on Pluto. Just before the battle got underway, a ship of unknown origin jumped in. It was only about the size of a Coalition Juggernutt, and it headed for Pluto, in hopes of hiding the artifact it had on board. Apparently, this was an alien ship that came from Sirius. The Nomads or Dom Kavash and the new aliens had been at war for only three weeks, and the new aliens called the Gaoul, were almost extinct. The ship that jumped in was the last remaining people of the Gaoul, and they had taken the artifact. That is when the Dom Kavash came to the Solar System. They planed to leave us out of this war, sense we were no threat to them at all. The artifact was nearly indestructible, and all the Dom Kavash had to do was destroy the ship. The Coalition thought the Dom Kavash ship was a last resort of the Alliance, and so they fired upon the new ship. This is what turned the Dom Kavash hostile to humans. And so, they launched a device into the Sun that turned it into a supernova, destroying the Solar System. The artifact survived, and so the Dom Kavash took it.&quot;
<br />
<br />Orillion stopped talking for a minute to give Kress a chance to talk. Before Kress had a chance to talk, he asked &quot;So how is it that you two are still alive? It just doesn't make sense.&quot; Quintane was about to speak when Kress cut him off. &quot;Be patient Mr. Trent, we're almost finished.&quot; He looked over to Orillion and he just nodded. Kress continued, &quot;How Frances managed to get the artifact in the first place is still unknown, but that artifact is the reason we are still alive. Dr. Quintane and Ms. Sinclair discovered that the artifact has the strange power to recall souls to a deceased body....&quot;
