			<div class="content">Ok, here it is. Written over a year ago. Got lost with the Excelcia forum crash, was reposted on the Infinity boards, now it should be safe here and not get lost again.
<br />
<br />I have learned many parts of this here on lancers, but a lot of things are also from self-studies and a lot of experimenting. Some of the things may be outdated / wrong - i mean its an old tut and i didnt had the time yet to fully overwork it - just to go quickly through it.
<br />

<br />
<br />P.S. i hope the code copy paste will work...
<br />
<br />edit: the copy paste did work, im about to remove the phpbb tags and rearange some code segments.

			<div class="content"><b>System Modding Knowledgebase </b>
<br />
<br />A note ahead: This tutorial was created by me ~ one year ago. Cyberion extended
<br />and reviewed it.
<br />This was probably the [shameless selfadmiringbeggest and best[/shameless
<br />selfadmiring system modding tutorial ever  written down. It got lost in the
<br />big Excelcia/Infinity forum crash. The content what you read has been extracted
<br />and recovered manually from a 190MB raw-backupfile of the forum's database.
<br />Now to the tutorial:
<br />
<br />This will be a <b>huge  </b> tutorial and knowledge-base for system modding. I
<br />write this as I learn and &quot;decrypt&quot; more and more parts of system-editing. It
<br />should help to learn and speed up modding of systems by giving good examples.
<br />I will also make a template-system to show that all things mentioned here
<br />really work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
<br />It will include ALL things that can be modded, with examples showing how to
<br />create populated systems like the ones in the game (with missions, bribes,...).
<br />This will be published and updated frequently as I make progress.
<br />The replies to this post will handle the numerous parts of system-modding.
<br />Best will be to go through all affected files one by one.
<br />I do all this with notepad. Freelancer Explorer may be a nice tool to create a
<br />system, but the result will always be a quick and dirty solution. I want to
<br />[uunderstand[/u the details of system-modding and FLEx is just a visual tool
<br />that hides the details - just one reason why I don't use it.
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>File organization  </b>
<br />
<br />I will try to explain which file holds what data and how they are connected or
<br />how they interact with each other. All paths are relative to the Freelancer
<br />directory, i.e. I treat it as root.
<br />Some filenames are system- and basename related. I will use &lt; system &gt; and &lt;
<br />base &gt; for these.
<br />A detailed description of each file will follow later. (damned, this will be a
<br />lot of work... It will hopefully pay back the effort when it is finished and
<br />makes system-modding easy)
<br />This only contains files where I exactly know what they do. Will be completed
<br />with the time.
<br />
<br />------------------
<br />
<br />
<br />Purchase and sale:
<br />----------------------
<br />Structure of these files is the same, entries are all in sections (one for each
<br />base)
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\EQUIPMENT\market_misc.ini  </b>
<br />Contains information about the availability of weapons and equipment on ALL
<br />bases.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\EQUIPMENT\market_ships.ini  </b>
<br />Contains information about the availability of ships on ALL bases.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\EQUIPMENT\market_commodities.ini  </b>
<br />Contains information about the availability of commodities on ALL bases.
<br />
<br />
<br />Objects:
<br />----------
<br />These are the descriptions of all fixed objects that can be found in space.
<br />Planets, bases, jumpholes/gates, asteroids, nebulas, stars,...
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\SOLAR\asteroidarch.ini  </b>
<br />Archetype references for all asteroids.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\SOLAR\stararch.ini  </b>
<br />Archetype reference for all stars.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\SOLAR\solararch.ini  </b>
<br />This is the &quot;big&quot; one, it holds all planets, bases and all other fixed objects.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\SOLAR\loadouts.ini  </b>
<br />All bases/stations/objects are equipped here (guns, shields, lights,...)
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\SOLAR\ASTEROIDS\&lt; system &gt;_&lt; asteroid field type name &gt;.ini  </b>
<br />This defines the visual look and behaviour of the asteroid field used.
<br />Minefields are also specified here.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\SOLAR\NEBULA\&lt; system &gt;_&lt; nebula type name &gt;.ini  </b>
<br />Definition of the visual look and behaviour of nebulas.
<br />
<br />
<br />[uUniverse:[/u
<br />This is the complete universe that you all know in FL. Systems, bases, fields,
<br />... everything.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\universe.ini  </b>
<br />A list of all bases and systems. System position on the galaxy map, map
<br />scales,... are defined here.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\shortest_illegal_path.ini  </b>
<br />Seems to be the place to define paths that cross several systems. This one
<br />prefers jumpholes.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\shortest_legal_path.ini  </b>
<br />Same as above, just prefers jumpgates.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS\&lt; system &gt;\&lt; system &gt;.ini  </b>
<br />This is the main part of each system. Objects, zones, fields, patrols, their
<br />positions, all this is found here. This is where you &quot;shape&quot; your system.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS\&lt; system &gt;\BASES\&lt; system &gt;_&lt; base &gt;_base.ini  </b>
<br />Defines a base with all its rooms.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS\&lt; system &gt;\BASES\ROOMS\&lt; system &gt;_&lt; base &gt;_&lt; location
<br />&gt;.ini  </b>
<br />Defines a room in the base and its connection to other rooms. Also character
<br />and ship placement.
<br />
<br /><b>\DATA\MISSIONS\mbases.ini  </b>
<br />This is probably the largest and most complicated ini-file in FL.
<br />The bases are all listed and populated here with characters (in the bar,
<br />traders, shipdealers,..). All missions, rumors and bribes are also defined here.
<br />
<br />
<br />Allright, this may have confused everyone I guess and i think I lost everyone's
<br />attention by now.
<br />Sorry, but this is a very complicated topic and it needs a lot of patience and
<br />endurance, but I try to summarize it a bit shorter <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Archetype files (these define the objects)  </b>
<br />asteroidarch.ini
<br />stararch.ini
<br />solararch.ini
<br />loadouts.ini
<br />
<br /><b>System files  </b>
<br />Archetypes are used in the system files (all these are nessessary to make a
<br />working system with bases and fields):
<br />
<br />note: could edit this to look right on these boards, sry
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;

<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Position and rotation  </b>
<br />
<br />It is essential to know how this works to place object in space to the spot
<br />where you want them to be. With the right usage of these, building bases with a
<br />lot of components is easy. Rotation is very important for tradelanes, too.
<br />
<br />The coordinates and rotation values are both in the format <b>X, Z, Y  </b>.
<br />(This is not 100% right but people are more used to the school-coordinate
<br />systems. In 3D-engines the axis are a bit different - i will use x, z, y for
<br />easier understaning, but in &quot;Real&quot; its still x, y, z)
<br />
<br /><b>Positions:  </b>
<br />X increases from west to east
<br />Z increases from bottom to top
<br />Y increases from north to south (note that this is the other way round as ppl
<br />think, but its common in computer environments)
<br />
<br />An important note: 10000 units in the ini-s are ~9k in space. It is not known
<br />why. (maybe ini-s are in meters and space in yards...)
<br />
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;
<br />  x ----------0++++++++++
<br />y -
<br />  -
<br />  -
<br />  -
<br />  -
<br />  -
<br />  0
<br />  +
<br />  +
<br />  +
<br />  +
<br />  +
<br />  + &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br /><b>Rotation:  </b>
<br />This works by degrees. Format is again <b>X, Z, Y  </b>
<br />You can use both 0 to 360 or -180 to 180 values.
<br />The value will rotate the object in an anti-clockwize (mathematically correct)
<br />direction.
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />rotation = 0, 0, 0 ; &lt;-- points to &quot;north&quot;
<br />rotation = 0, 90, 0 ; &lt;-- points to &quot;west&quot;
<br />rotation = 0, 180, 0 ; &lt;-- points to &quot;south&quot;
<br />rotation = 0, -90, 0 ; &lt;-- points to &quot;east&quot;
<br />
<br />rotation = 180, 0 , 0 ; &lt;-- object flipped upside down
<br />rotation = 0, 0, 180 ; &lt;-- object flipped upside down, but around the y-axis &amp;
<br />mirrored to 180, 0, 0
<br />
<br />rotating around 1 axis' is fine without more calculations, but if you want to
<br />rotate 2 or 3, you have to refer to maths a bit more to make everything
<br />correct. (you can message me if u want more detailed info)
<br />

<br />
<br /><b>System Framework  </b>
<br />
<br />File:
<br />\DATA\UNIVERSE\&lt; System &gt;\&lt; system &gt;.ini
<br />
<br />This file contains the following sections:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[SystemInfo
<br />[Archetype
<br />[EncounterParameters
<br />[TexturePanels
<br />[Dust
<br />[Asteroids
<br />[Nebula
<br />[Music
<br />[Ambient
<br />[Background
<br />[LightSource
<br />[Object
<br />[Zone &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />Explanations:
<br /><b>[SystemInfo  </b>
<br />Self-explaining. colors are RGB-format.
<br />space_color = 0, 0, 0
<br />local_faction = li_p_grp ; from faction_prop.ini
<br />
<br /><b>[Archetype  </b>
<br />This is for preloading and cashing archetype files (cmp, .3db for example).
<br />This section is optional.
<br />It might increase loading time of systems, but it decreases loading time during
<br />flight in space when a NPC pops up.
<br />Using this is recommended to use on low-end systems.
<br />
<br /><b>[EncounterParameters  </b>
<br />This section is used once for each encounter type. Those are specified in the
<br />DATA\MISSIONS\ENCOUNTERS\ directory
<br />Things like number, class and basic behaviour of appearing ships are set there.
<br />
<br /><b>[TexturePanels  </b>
<br />This is always this entry:
<br />file = universe\heavens\shapes.ini
<br />
<br /><b>[Dust  </b>
<br />Specifies the type of dust you will find throughout the system. Zones can have
<br />their own types of dust. One is for example the burning-effect when entering
<br />athmospheres or getting near to suns.
<br />Typical is:
<br />spacedust = Dust
<br />
<br /><b>[Asteroids  </b>
<br />Reference to the \DATA\SOLAR\ASTEROIDS\ entries.
<br />Assignment of these to zones.
<br />
<br /><b>[Nebula  </b>
<br />Reference to the \DATA\SOLAR\NEBULA\ entries.
<br />Assignment of these to zones.
<br />
<br /><b>[Music  </b>
<br />Self-explaining.
<br />space = music_li_space
<br />danger = music_li_danger
<br />battle = music_li_battle
<br />Hint: you can play own music or sound files (wave). Take a look at
<br />\DATA\AUDIO\music.ini and ...\sound.ini
<br />
<br /><b>[Ambient  </b>
<br />Self-explaining. RGB
<br />color = 30, 50, 80
<br />
<br /><b>[Background  </b>
<br />Here you set the background stars and background nebulas.
<br />Pick one from an existing system.
<br />
<br /><b>[LightSource  </b>
<br />Lights. Set the color, distance, type and attenuation curve.
<br />An important thing to create the right effects and visual feeling of your
<br />system. I think an eclipse could be possible to create <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><b>[Object  </b>
<br />These are ALL objects that are placed into space. They usually have a position,
<br />a rotation, the archetype (type of object).
<br />Objects can be give loadouts to fill in hardpoints (weapons on bases,
<br />lights,...).
<br />Objects usually have a reputation, i.e. they belong to a faction.
<br />All kinds of solid objects (Stars, Planets, Bases, static asteroids, wrecks,
<br />tradelanes, jumpgates, jumpholes,...) are specified here.
<br />I will go into detail one by one in later posts.
<br />
<br /><b>[Zone  </b>
<br />Zones are all types of fields (visible or not) that contain something.
<br />They have a position, a rotation, a shape, a size and a lot of other data
<br />depending on their function.
<br />Typical zones are:
<br />asteroid fields, nebulas, encounter zones (traffic, battles), planet
<br />athmospheres, radiation areas, low-sensor-range areas, minefields, mission
<br />areas and sun / planet kill areas (when ramming those).
<br />I will explain these one-by-one later.');
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>System Framework (continued)  </b>
<br />
<br />This short section will handle the following files in the \DATA\UNIVERSE
<br />directory:
<br />universe.ini
<br />shortest_illegal_path.ini
<br />systems_shortest_path.ini
<br />
<br /><b>universe.ini  </b>
<br />There are two important section types:
<br />[System and [Base. There is a section fro each system and base in the game.

<br />Explanation:
<br /><b>nickname =  </b>
<br />Name of the System in the \UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS directory.
<br />
<br /><b>file =   </b>
<br />Filename of the system ini.
<br />
<br /><b>pos =  </b>
<br />This sets the location of the system in the universe map. Coordinates are
<br />handled in a similar way as with systems X, Y.
<br />X increases from west to east
<br />Y increases from north to south
<br />values range from 0 to 15 in the builtin maps. center (NY) is 7, 8
<br />
<br /><b>msg_id_prefix =   </b>
<br />Format: gcs_refer_system_&lt; system &gt;
<br />This is used by NPCs when messaging around.
<br />Probably won't work for custom systems.
<br />
<br /><b>visit =  </b>
<br />This seems to be a binary flag value.
<br />flag numbers:  8765/4321  -&gt; combined to a value from the binary pattern
<br />1: System is shown on map from start. -&gt; visit = 1
<br />2-7: unknown
<br />8: System never shows up on map. -&gt; visit = 128
<br />
<br />visit = 0 is the recommended value (system doesn't show up until found)
<br />
<br /><b>strid_name =  </b>
<br />Name infocard reference.
<br />
<br /><b>ids_info =  </b>
<br />Infocard reference for system information.
<br />
<br /><b>NavMapScale =  </b>
<br />Scale of the system map. Typical entries range from 0 to 2. default is 1.
<br />
<br />

<br />BGCS_base_run_by = W02bF36 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br /><b>nickname =   </b>
<br />Reference name of the base.
<br />
<br /><b>System =  </b>
<br />The sytem name where the base is located.
<br />
<br /><b>strid_name=   </b>
<br />Infocard name reference.
<br />
<br /><b>file =   </b>
<br />Location of the base ini-file.
<br />
<br /><b>BGCS_base_run_by =   </b>
<br />??? maybe also a Hex offset for infocard info
<br />
<br />-------------------
<br /><b>shortest_illegal_path.ini  </b> and <b>systems_shortest_path.ini  </b> work the
<br />same way, but use different routes to get from one to another system.
<br />
<br />there is one section [SystemConnections for each system. The path to ALL other
<br />systems will be inserted here in the following format.
<br />example:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;SystemConnections&gt;
<br />Path = Li01, Hi01, Li01, Li03, Iw06, Ku02, Ku03, Bw08, Ew01, Hi01
<br />Path = Li01, Li01, Li01
<br />Path = Li01, Li03, Li01, Li03
<br />Path = Li01, Rh05, Li01, Li04, Iw01, Rh02, Rh01, Rh05
<br />Path = Li01, Rh01, Li01, Li04, Iw01, Rh02, Rh01
<br />Path = Li01, Rh03, Li01, Li04, Iw01, Rh02, Rh01, Rh03
<br />Path = Li01, Br06, Li01, Li02, Iw04, Br02, Br04, Br06
<br />... &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />Explanation:
<br />Path = &lt; source &gt; , &lt; destination &gt;, &lt; list of systems passed through,
<br />including source and destination &gt;
<br />
<br />example:
<br />Path = Li01, Rh01, Li01, Li04, Iw01, Rh02, Rh01
<br />source is NY, destination NB.
<br />the path is NY-&gt;Texas-&gt;Bering-&gt;Hamburg-&gt;NB
<br />
<br />The 2 files also differ in the usage of gates and holes. Its not know how this
<br />exactly works. Also inner-system paths(waypoint are still unknown).
<br />
<br />I am not sure if this is needed to make a system work and it seems unimportant
<br />because waypoint over systems are rare (almost only at missions with a spread
<br />group).
<br />Making entries for the connected systems worked for me. (can still be extended
<br />later. I need to test what happens when I try this with a path that has no
<br />entry here)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Path tested without system-entry. It will refuse to set a waypoint by
<br />telling &quot;no path&quot; -&gt; works without them, but should be done for a well-made
<br />system.
<br />
<br />So much to the framework of a system.
<br />
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>Connecting Systems / Jumpgates / Jumpholes  </b>
<br />Jumpgates and holes are basically the same, just the look and docking behaviour
<br />is different.
<br />
<br />Example:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[zone
<br />nickname = Zone_Li01_to_Li04_hole
<br />pos = 15425, 0, 83760
<br />shape = SPHERE
<br />size = 2000
<br />property_flags = 131072
<br />visit = 128
<br />sort = 99
<br />
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = Li01_to_Li04_hole
<br />ids_name = 260916
<br />pos = 15425, 0, 83760
<br />Archetype = jumphole
<br />msg_id_prefix = gcs_refer_system_Li04
<br />ids_info = 66146
<br />jump_effect = jump_effect_hole
<br />visit = 0
<br />goto = Li04, Li04_to_LI01_hole, gate_tunnel_bretonia &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />Usually, only the [Object entry is needed, as that is our jumphole. The [Zone
<br />around it can be useful though. One example is to use this as an exclusion-zone
<br />in asteroid fields (more detail on that in later tuts). This makes sure that
<br />there are no asteroids near the jumphole.
<br />
<br />Explanation of entries (zones will be explained later):
<br /><b>[u[Object[/u  </b>
<br />
<br /><b>nickname, ids_name, pos, ids_info  </b>
<br />these are very common in most ini-s and should be known by now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br /><b>Archetype =  </b>
<br />This is the model used from the solararch.ini.
<br />Typical entries are jumphole, jumpgate, jumphole_red,...
<br />
<br /><b>msg_id_prefix =  </b>
<br />Reference for NPC messages.
<br />
<br /><b>jump_effect =  </b>
<br />The visual effect during the system-change.
<br />
<br /><b>visit =   </b>
<br />similar flag-system as explained in the system framework under universe.ini
<br />A common value is 0 (visible on map after spotting it)
<br />
<br /><b>goto =  </b>
<br />This specifies the destination of the jump.
<br />Format is:
<br />goto = &lt; destination system &gt;, &lt; destination object &gt;, &lt; visual effect during
<br />jump &gt;
<br />Example:
<br />goto = Li04, Li04_to_LI01_hole, gate_tunnel_bretonia
<br />
<br />Important: To make the jump work in both directions you need to set up a
<br />similar object in the destination system, just the other way round.
<br />
<br />Creating one-way holes is possible by blocking one gate/hole in
<br />initialworld.ini. Inner-system connections are possible without problems.
<br />
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><b>Tradelanes  </b>
<br />Tradelanes
<br />
<br />Just a few notes:
<br />Lanes that go straight work in ANY angle.
<br />Lanes that change direction mess up the tunnel-animation. This can be corrected
<br />by taking out the visual effcet of the tunnel.
<br />Just comment out the following line in <b>select_equip.ini  </b> like this:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[TradeLane
<br />...
<br />;tl_player_travel = basic_tl_player_travel
<br />... &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />Please remember that lanes going over edges basically work, but the
<br />direction-change is instant and will look strange at this speed when you make
<br />turns of over ~10 degrees.
<br />
<br />Cyberion, i need to find ur edit - it was stored seperately.
<br />

<br />
<br /><b>Dockable Bases  </b>
<br />
<br />This is a very complicated topic, I will try to explain it into detail as good
<br />as I can. Note that this does NOT include populating bases and missions, that
<br />will come later.
<br />You will need to edit several files to set up a base:
<br />
<br />-UNIVERSE 
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\universe.ini  </b>
<br />A base needs an entry here to work properly. See details in &quot;System framework&quot;
<br />in a post above.
<br />
<br />-MAP 
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS\&lt; system &gt;\&lt; system &gt;.ini  </b>
<br />This is the &quot;map&quot; of the system. The base will be placed as an object. Several
<br />modules (objects) can be &quot;merged&quot; to a single base.
<br />
<br />-BASE 
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS\&lt; system &gt;\Bases\&lt; system &gt;_&lt; base &gt;_Base.ini  </b>
<br />List of all rooms in the base and references to the room-inis.
<br />
<br />-ROOM 
<br /><b>\DATA\UNIVERSE\SYSTEMS\&lt; system &gt;\Bases\Rooms\&lt; system &gt;_&lt; base &gt;_&lt; Room
<br />&gt;.ini  </b>
<br />This contains the information about the rooms in the base.
<br />
<br />---------------------------
<br />
<br />MAP 
<br />Here are the entries of a typical station:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;; *** Dockable station ***
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = Tut01_01
<br />ids_name = 0
<br />pos = 2000, -500, 10000
<br />rotate = 0, -90, 0
<br />Archetype = prison
<br />ids_info = 0
<br />base = Tut01_01_Base
<br />dock_with = Tut01_01_Base
<br />voice = atc_leg_f01
<br />space_costume = br_karina_head_gen, li_female_guard_body
<br />faction = li_p_grp
<br />reputation = li_p_grp
<br />behavior = NOTHING
<br />difficulty_level = 2
<br />loadout = prison_li_01
<br />pilot = pilot_solar_hardest &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br /><b>nickname, ids_name, ids_info, pos, rotate, faction, loadout  </b>
<br />See in previous posts, should be clear by now.
<br />
<br /><b>Archetype =  </b>
<br />This is the &quot;look&quot; of the base. A &quot;gallery&quot; system with all available types has
<br />been made by seveal people (see another thread).
<br />
<br /><b>base =  </b>
<br />This is the name of the base. It's also used for as a reference to the base-ini.
<br />
<br /><b>dock_with =  </b>
<br />Docking with this object will automatically lead to docking with the named base.
<br />Example: a planet is a base, but docking at the docking ring (a seperate
<br />object) makes you dock at it.
<br />
<br /><b>voice =  </b>
<br />The always friendly voice that greets you when docking.
<br />
<br /><b>space_costume =  </b>
<br />This is the look of the person/robot that appears in the small message window
<br />when you dock to a base.
<br />
<br /><b>behaviour =  </b>
<br />??? if an object had this, then the value was always: NOTHING
<br />
<br /><b>difficulty_level =  </b>
<br />Set this to a value that fits your needs. I am not sure what this is used for.
<br />
<br /><b>pilot =  </b>
<br />This is the skill of the base and determines how accurate turrets will fire.
<br />
<br />[size=16[uAdding modules to bases[/u[/size
<br />This is explained by an example:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = Tut01_01_space_habitat_wide_01
<br />pos = 2000, -300, 10000
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />archetype = space_habitat_wide
<br />reputation = li_p_grp
<br />parent = Tut01_01 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />This is pretty easy, most difficult is to align the position and rotation of
<br />the module.
<br />The <b>parent = Tut01_01  </b> line makes that the module is NOT treated as an
<br />individual object but as a part of the base -&gt; you can only target the base,
<br />not each component.
<br />Some base modules can also be docked to, in this case you need a &quot;dock_with =&quot;
<br />entry.
<br />
<br /><b>Making bases and modules destroyable is a more sensitive and difficult
<br />topic, I will handle that later.  </b>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------
<br />
<br />BASE 
<br />A typical ini file for a base looks like this:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[BaseInfo;
<br />nickname = Tut01_01_Base
<br />start_room = Bar
<br />
<br />[Room
<br />nickname = Deck
<br />file = Universe\Systems\Tut01\Bases\Rooms\Tut01_01_deck.ini
<br />
<br />[Room
<br />nickname = Bar
<br />file = Universe\Systems\Tut01\Bases\Rooms\Tut01_01_bar.ini
<br />
<br />[Room
<br />nickname = Trader
<br />file = Universe\Systems\Tut01\Bases\Rooms\Tut01_01_trader.ini
<br />
<br />[Room
<br />nickname = ShipDealer
<br />file = Universe\Systems\Tut01\Bases\Rooms\Tut01_01_shipdealer.ini
<br />
<br />[Room
<br />nickname = Equipment
<br />file = Universe\Systems\Tut01\Bases\Rooms\Tut01_01_equipment.ini &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />Everything is self-explaining here.
<br />You define the rooms of the base and assign the ini-files.
<br />
<br />------------------------------
<br />
<br />ROOM 
<br />The basic structure here is always the same:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[Room_Info
<br />set_script = scripts\bases\Li_01_equipment_hardpoint_01.thn

<br />

<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_HOTSPOT_EXIT
<br />behavior = ExitDoor
<br />room_switch = Deck
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_HOTSPOT_BAR
<br />behavior = ExitDoor
<br />room_switch = Bar
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_HOTSPOT_COMMODITYTRADER_ROOM
<br />behavior = ExitDoor
<br />room_switch = Trader
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_HOTSPOT_EQUIPMENTDEALER_ROOM
<br />behavior = ExitDoor
<br />room_switch = Equipment
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_HOTSPOT_SHIPDEALER_ROOM
<br />behavior = ExitDoor
<br />room_switch = ShipDealer
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_NN_REPAIR_YOUR_SHIP
<br />behavior = Repair
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_DEALER_FRONT_DESK
<br />behavior = FrontDesk
<br />state_read = 1
<br />state_send = 2
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_HOTSPOT_EQUIPMENTDEALER
<br />behavior = StartEquipDealer
<br />state_read = 2
<br />state_send = 1
<br />
<br />[Hotspot
<br />name = IDS_EQUIPMENT_ROOM_RIGHT
<br />behavior = MoveRight
<br />state_read = 2
<br />state_send = 1 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />Explanation:
<br /><b>[Room_info  </b>
<br />The general setting of the room. Use an entry of a known place.
<br />
<br /><b>[Spiels  </b>
<br />Animation sequences.
<br />
<br /><b>[Room_Sound  </b>
<br />The sound/music (look up in \DATA\AUDIO\sounds.ini (music.ini)) of the room.
<br />
<br /><b>[Camera  </b>
<br />&quot;Hardpoint&quot; of viewer camera. (all rooms are model files, just like ships)
<br />
<br /><b>[CharacterPlacement  </b>
<br />Self-explaining, use a known entry.
<br />
<br /><b>[PlayerShipPlacement  </b>
<br />Placement of ship if it should be visible in the area.
<br />
<br /><b>[Hotspot  </b>
<br />Most important entry in the rooms. This defines where you get when you click on
<br />an icon when docked.
<br />Rooms can be &quot;re-used&quot; with the &quot;virtual_room&quot; feature. This way, you can place
<br />the equipment, the merchant and the shipdealer in the same location.
<br />The &quot;state_read&quot; and &quot;state_send&quot; entries specify actions like the change
<br />between the room and &quot;walking to the shipdealer's desk&quot; for example. I haven't
<br />figured out more details yet.
<br />
<br /><b>Other entries  </b>
<br />There are a couple of other things available, like flashlights (seen in most
<br />capitols), also other stuff.
<br />
<br />Best is to take a look at a base/room that alredy exists in the game. There are
<br />more than enough available &quot;templates&quot;, so you just have to find the &quot;right
<br />one&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />After working out all rooms, we should have a finished base, although it is not
<br />populated, so things most probably won't work yet.
<br />Adding characters to bases will follow shortly.
<br />
<br />______________________________________
<br />
<br /><b>Virtual Rooms in bases  </b>
<br />
<br />This section is about using virtual rooms. This means basically, that you don't
<br />have a new room for each basic service at bases (merchant, equipment, ships).
<br />You can place all those characters into the same room. Switching to another
<br />service
<br />means to enter a virtual room with the character. The location (the look,
<br />ambience,..) stays the same.
<br />Individual rooms for each service are usually used on planets in the unmodified
<br />game, while virtual rooms are used almost everywhere.
<br />I will just post a working example, the details are explained in the section
<br />above.
<br />(This example is from the Liberty HQ base i made)

<br /><b>Populating Bases/Missions  </b>
<br />
<br />...continued from the &quot;Bases&quot; section...
<br />
<br />We have a base that appears in space. It has all the rooms defined, but needs a
<br />few character to bring life to the base. Custom missions is connected very
<br />closely with this, so I will try to explain as much as I know about them.
<br />This all is about the biggest and maybe most complicted ini-file in FL:
<br /><b>\DATA\MISSIONS\mbases.ini  </b>
<br />
<br />[color=redWARNING: bini (also other ini decompressors) mess a few lines up and
<br />corrupt the file. I will put a link here to a corrected version (later)[/color
<br />update with the rework of the tutorial: use the files from the Freelancer SDK
<br />1.3. get it from lancersreactor.
<br />
<br />Again, I will post my &quot;tutorial&quot; base as an example.

<br />Additional explanations:
<br /><b>Bribes  </b>
<br />Our bartender offers a bribe. These are esay to set up, its just this simple
<br />line:
<br />bribe = fc_lr_grp, 10000, 16100
<br />format is:
<br />bribe = &lt; faction &gt;, cash factor, &lt; DLL-reference to bribe text &gt;
<br />the cash factor is no multiplier, but it can be changed. Lower values make
<br />cheaper prices, but not all seem to work.

<br />True&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank>[uHere[/u</a> is a link to a few known values.
<br />
<br /><b>[GF_NPC  </b>
<br />This is for creating NPCs - self-explaining. You assign a body, head, hands,
<br />name, affiliation, voice, accessory and a room.
<br />Also missions offered by NPCs are defined here.
<br />
<br /><b>[MRoom  </b>
<br />The rooms we defined in the base are populated here. It is possible to place
<br />all the &quot;default&quot; NPCs (trader, equipment,...) in the same room. In this case
<br />the &quot;virtual_rooms&quot; I meantioned earlier are needed.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />[size=16<b>Missions  </b>[/size
<br />
<br />We have already set up the mission and someone who offers it to you.
<br />I recall:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;offers_missions = true
<br />mission_type = DestroyMission, 0.000000, 0.442387, 100 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />mission_type = &lt; type &gt;, &lt; min diffclass &gt;,&lt; max diffclass &gt;, &lt; percentage to
<br />appear for this faction &gt;
<br />min and max level are for the cash, the weight defines the difficulty.
<br />
<br />Missions offered by NPCs are a bit different:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;misn = DestroyMission, 0.000000, 0.112387 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />Format is almost the same, no need for a faction percentage because the NPC is
<br />only one who offers the mission.
<br />I recall:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[BaseFaction
<br />faction = li_p_grp
<br />weight = 30 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />We still need a destination for the mission. This is placed into the main
<br />ini-file of the system and it is a zone. example from NY:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[zone
<br />nickname = zone_li01_destroy_vignette_1
<br />pos = -23536, 0, -52599
<br />shape = SPHERE
<br />size = 10000
<br />mission_type = unlawful
<br />sort = 99.500000
<br />vignette_type = open &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />I think the vignette zones are picked at random, there are over 60 of these in
<br />NY alone. The size defines the area where the mission takes place. If you leave
<br />this, then mission commission will tell you that you failed cause you left the
<br />mission area. This zone must overlap with an existing encounter zone.
<br />
<br />Additional loot from missions:
<br />take a look at RMLootInfo.ini, entries are pretty self-explaining.
<br />
<br /><b>??? Problems/unsure points ???  </b>
<br />- mission types: i could only find the entry &quot;destroy missions&quot;, but this
<br />spawns also recover, destroy and baseassault missions. would be nice to specify
<br />a certain type.
<br />- selective mission destination: donno if its even possible...
<br />- file: VignetteParams.ini many people have tried and failed to get the logic
<br />behind this file. It was a script for sure that has been converted to an
<br />ini-file.
<br />
<br />I think this post will need a lot of overworking/overthinking when I figure out
<br />even more details.
<br />
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Purchase and Sale  </b>
<br />
<br />This is an easy topic, but important to do.
<br />files are all in \DATA\EQUIPMENTmarket_commodities.ini
<br />market_misc.ini
<br />market_ships.ini
<br />
<br />The entries are also identical (except ships!). You MUST define a base in each
<br />of these files, even if you don't sell anything at the base. Otherwise the game
<br />will crash when you enter the base (happened to me).
<br />A typical entry:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[BaseGood
<br />base = Li01_01_base
<br />MarketGood = li_gun01_mark01, 0, -1, 10, 10, 0, 1
<br />... &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />This was taken from market_misc.ini and shows the start of Manhattan base in NY.
<br />The format for the entries is the same in ALL of these 3 files.
<br />
<br />MarketGood = &lt; 0 &gt;, &lt; 1 &gt;, &lt; 2 &gt;, &lt; 3 &gt;, &lt; 4 &gt;, &lt; 5 &gt;, &lt; 6 &gt;
<br />[list[*0 - Package name from any of the &quot;goods&quot; inis (weapon_good.ini,
<br />st_good.ini, goods.ini, ...)
<br />[*1 - Level requirement to buy - doesnt work in MP
<br />[*2 - Reputation requirement, range is from -1 to 1, 0 is neutral. -1 means
<br />everyone (including enemies) can buy it
<br />[*3 - unknown, but it follows a pattern
<br />[*4 - unknown, but it follows a pattern
<br />[*5 - unknown
<br />[*6 - base price multiplier[/list
<br />
<br />Examples (should cover all possibilities):
<br /><b>Commodities  </b>
<br />MarketGood = commodity_boron, 0, -1, 150, 500, 0, 1.300000 ;&lt;---for sale
<br />MarketGood = commodity_gold, 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2 ;&lt;---not for sale
<br /><b>Equipment/Weapons  </b>
<br />MarketGood = missile01_mark01, 0, -1, 10, 10, 0, 1 ;&lt;---weapon
<br />MarketGood = missile01_mark01_ammo, 0, -1, 50, 50, 0, 1 ;&lt;---ammo
<br />
<br /><b>Ships  </b>
<br />Format is a bit different, an additional field is added - it is still unknown.
<br />price multipliers dont work for ships.
<br />
<br />marketgood = lf_package, 1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 ;&lt;---patriot for sale
<br />marketgood = lf_package, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 ;&lt;---patriot not for sale
<br />
<br />The &quot;not for sale&quot; entries can be important for commodities to specify the
<br />price., but they are irrelevant for ships.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Planets and Stars  </b>
<br />
<br />This is also a small and pretty easy section. In FL, a planet and a star are
<br />pretty the same and they behave in a very similar way. Both have an athmosphere
<br />range where the \&quot;burning\&quot; effect starts and both have a zone that kills
<br />objects who would crash into the planet/star.
<br />Example:
<br /><b>PLANET:  </b>
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[Object
<br />nickname = Tut01_Planet_01
<br />ids_name = 0
<br />pos = 10000, 1000, 10000
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />ambient_color = 0, 0, 0
<br />Archetype = planet_crater_1000
<br />ids_info = 0
<br />spin = 0, 0.001, 0
<br />atmosphere_range = 1200
<br />burn_color = 160, 222, 245
<br />reputation = li_p_grp
<br />visit = 0
<br />
<br />[zone
<br />nickname = Zone_Tut01_Planet_01_death
<br />pos = 10000, 1000, 10000
<br />shape = SPHERE
<br />size = 1100
<br />damage = 10000
<br />sort = 99.500000
<br />density = 0
<br />relief_time = 0
<br />population_additive = false &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />I think most entries here are self-explaining, I will take a closer look to
<br />some of them:
<br />
<br />[Object
<br />...
<br /><b>spin = 0, 0.001, 0  </b>
<br />This is how the object spins around the 3 axis' values are in radiants per sec
<br />i think (i will try 2pi, then it should spin once per sec-&gt;poor citicens).
<br />You can also rotate around another axis.
<br />The &quot;spin = &quot; entry can be also used to rotate all other types of objects.
<br />Could be nice to have base parts rotating for example solar panels, other
<br />modules,...
<br />I have some other fancy ideas here, but will post them when they work.
<br />
<br /><b>atmosphere_range = 1200
<br />burn_color = 160, 222, 245  </b>
<br />Self-explaining, but good to know <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I think these can also be set for all kinds of objects.
<br />
<br />Dockable planets need a docking ring and a &quot;base = mybasename&quot; entry.
<br />The dockinring would have the line &quot;dock_with = mybasename&quot;.
<br />
<br /><b>STAR:  </b>
<br />Example:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[Object
<br />nickname = Sun_Tut01
<br />ids_name = 0
<br />pos = 20000, 2000, 20000
<br />ambient_color = 255, 255, 255
<br />Archetype = sun_2000
<br />ids_info = 0
<br />star = med_white_sun
<br />atmosphere_range = 11000
<br />burn_color = 160, 222, 245
<br />
<br />[zone
<br />nickname = Zone_Tut01_sun_death
<br />pos = 20000, 2000, 20000
<br />shape = SPHERE
<br />size = 10000
<br />damage = 10000
<br />sort = 99.500000
<br />density = 0
<br />relief_time = 0
<br />population_additive = false
<br />
<br />[LightSource
<br />nickname = Tut01_System_LIGHT
<br />pos = 642, 0, 198
<br />color = 255, 255, 255
<br />range = 120000
<br />type = DIRECTIONAL
<br />atten_curve = DYNAMIC_DIRECTION &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />I think this is also self-explaining. Only addition is a lightsource.
<br />I will explain lights in another tutorial.
<br />
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<br />A small addition to the tutorial above:
<br />This is for NPCs and custom-factions, just a few details to extend our
<br />knowledgebase.
<br />
<br /><b>Specifying cargo of faction NPCs  </b>
<br />edit the file \DATA\EQUIPMENT\commodities_per_faction.ini
<br />
<br />A typical entry looks like this:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[FactionGood
<br />faction = gd_z_grp
<br />MarketGood = commodity_alien_artifacts, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_alien_organisms, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_basic_alloys, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_consumer_goods, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_engine_components, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_fertilizers, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_food, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_H_fuel, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_optical_chips, , 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_optronics, , 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_oxygen, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_pharm, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_polymers, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_sidearms, 0, 0
<br />MarketGood = commodity_water, 0, 0 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />I think its pretty self-explaining, but I don't know what the numbers mean.
<br />
<br /><b>Adding loot (in random missions) to ships that belong to custom factions  </b>
<br />This will be dropped in <b>addition  </b> to the usual loot (guns, equipment)
<br />that is dropped by ships. This is also the reason why loot is a lot more than
<br />with encounters.
<br />
<br />edit the file \DATA\RANDOMMISSIONS\RMLootInfo.ini
<br />A typical entry:
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;[RMBonusLoot
<br />archetype = commodity_alien_organisms
<br />num_to_drop = 1, 2
<br />faction = co_shi_grp, co_be_grp, co_ti_grp, co_ss_grp, co_hsp_grp, co_nws_grp,
<br />fc_c_grp, fc_ou_grp, fc_j_grp, fc_h_grp, fc_lr_grp, gd_gm_grp, gd_z_grp
<br />difficulty_range = 6, 31
<br />weight = 1 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />Entries are pretty self-explaining. <b>num_to_drop  </b> and
<br /><b>difficulty_range  </b> are both min, max values. <b>faction  </b> lists all
<br />factions that carry this random cargo on missions.
<br /><b>weight  </b> is the probability that this type of loot is dropped, typical
<br />values are 3 for batts/nanos, 5 for guns and 1 for commodities.
<br />
