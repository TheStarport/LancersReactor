<br />Guts, Guns, Criminals, and Credits For Them All
<br />A new short story areana story, by Zeta1
<br />
<br />NEWARK STATION, NEW YORK SYSTEM
<br />A bounty hunter. that was what Victor Johnson wanted to be ever since he was a child. Soon he would be one. He was 21, 6.2, weighed 200 pounds, and had 3 thousand credits, and a single room apartment of his own on the station.
<br />Victor walked in the bar, his dark blue jacket matching that of the walls. he quickly slid into a backless chair at the bar counter. &quot;Vic!&quot; called over the his bartender freind, Buster Richey, a well rounded, full-breed-liberty man with a multicolor-stained apron acttually looking kind of cool made his way past another bar patron and rested his elbows onto the the glass bar, lit up below the glass were TV monitors, playing the news, hoverball, Liberty Action Channel, the foreyes, such as Tela-Bretonia, Kusari, Rheinland. Victor got to view a double screen, Liberty Public News, and Hoverball. Victor prayed a pray of thanks to the Lord that he didnt show the zero-gravity gymnastics workout channel. Buster craned his neck around to see from Victor's side to watch hoverball.  Victor stared at Buster and cocked a brow. Buster turned around and turned two shades redder. &quot;Hoverball Buster?&quot; &quot;Yea!&quot; he beamed. &quot;I didnt tell you to see if you'd notice!&quot; he raised his eye brows expectantly, still smiling. &quot;Notice what?&quot; i plainly asked. &quot;If you noticed that i lost some weight!&quot; &quot;Oh, yea, come to think of it, looks like you lost a pound or two.&quot; i shrugged and gave a sheepish, sarcastic smile. &quot;Well i'm just getting started!&quot; he threw off the dis. &quot;you see, theres this secretary for the station engineer, and..&quot; &quot;Oh boy! here we go! Buster you havent been on a date in twelve years! Wait!&quot; i interuppted before he said anything &quot;Just give me Stigma Flamer.&quot; &quot;For the last time! We dont have that GMG miner gas miner Naha crud. we have everything else tho, this is a busy base with ships from all round' Sirius, I have a good selection, so just cus' we i dont have one drink your teeded off! we dont get any GMG ships here.&quot; &quot;Fine! Fine! you've made your point, just give an Interspace Itinerary, will ya?&quot; i asked
<br />&quot;That stuff's even worse.&quot; Buster muttered to himself turning around and grabbing a  cup shaped like a lower-case I with a cherry floating above as the dot, suspended by and anti-grav lining of the bottom of the cup. He turned around and handed me the Interspace Commerce specialty drink. &quot;5 credits Vic.&quot; i handed him pulled out my neural net card out of my net chrono watch and handed it to him and watched him slide it thru a lining  in the bar. &quot;Listen Buster i said in between the disorienting drinks. [because of the anti-grav lining your mouth feels weightless. &quot;Today's the day.&quot; &quot;What's the day?&quot; he asked. &quot;Today's the day I join the Bounty Hunter Guild.&quot; I said. i finished my drinked and sighed with satisfaction. &quot;Thanks Buster.&quot; I slid the drink a couple inches to him and turned around. En route to the table a tough looking Bounty Hunter sat at.</div>

			<div class="content">Victor walked up behind the bounty hunter and cleared his throat loud enough for him to hear. &quot;I'm looking to join the Bounty Hunters, you look like an intellignet man.&quot; he said in a big as voice as he could without hinting he was trying to look good. The Hunter sipped his drink and answered without turning around. &quot;Yup, you got some smarts, sid'down, and lemme see ya marker.&quot; Victor pulled out his marker chip from his wrist-neural-net. The man inserted it into a datapad and started stroking his chin, studying his records. &quot;Moved to Newark Station nine months ago,&quot; he mumbled to himself aloud. &quot;Ran convoy protection with some Interspace Convoys from here to Ames resarch up in Kepler.&quot; he stopped stroking his chin. Victor knew what was next. &quot;Says here that, when you were ambushed some Rouges, the transport acting captain who took over when the captain was injured refused to leave for the gate to Colorado, and wanted to stay and fight. You knew he wouldn't last, so u threatened to fire on him if he didnt go. He, being a stubborn, inexperinced noob to the buisness ignored you, you positioned your starflier right by the bridege viewport, and set on of your justices on overload. And that got his attention, no?&quot; he raised his eyebrows expectantly. &quot;Well, uh, yes sir, thats correct.&quot; He turned a couple shades redder. &quot;Well pal, your lucky you came to me, I appreciate that sorts'a thing. Your hired.&quot; Victor beamed. &quot;Equipment room, two hours, im Rick McLausky.&quot; he downed the rest of his drink and started to walk away, only to turn around. &quot;Oh and Mr. Johnson,&quot; he called. &quot;Yea?&quot; &quot;Welcome to the Guild Mr. Johnson.&quot; he turned and walked away.</div>

			<div class="content">The following is a short story, not much story line to it, however, if you want to read some fast paced action where you dont have to read through dialugue for two years, this is why this arena is here! Read the following and post what you think!!!!! [this writing is kind of phonetic, so dont dismiss it as worthless crud you believe isnt worthy of being thrown out, sent to the junk-yard, grinded up, pulled onto magnet, dropped on a conveyer belt, going through a big machine talking the international machine language of CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! and coming out the other end as a toaster!!!!!! *starts freaking out at the word toaster because of his mortal fear of toasters, running into walls, spinning around in his office chair into a flys out of a window.* alrighty now. *Clears his throat, starts choking, throws up out the window, unfortunatly hits the freaking out person from the toaster, causing him to freak out, run into walls, spin in his office chair and fly out a window, because of his mortal fear of throw up.* alright, seriously, well, then again i might have to go through a couple more mortal fears to confront, but ya know, its in my nature. WHOA!! THATS GUNNA SET ME BACK A COUPLE DAYS! third peice of pumpkin pie tonight. Whoa i dont feel so good, i think i might need to throwing up out the window. well  i have to go to bed now, ill give the prolouge tomorrow, and probs the story.

			<div class="content">PROLOUGE
<br />
<br />
<br />Thomas Warner zipped up his jacket and shivered from the cold on the Ice Carved Mactan base he called home. He felt around his hip, going over his &quot;Phoneix&quot; Detroit Magnum he had gotten for his 16th Birthday 7 years ago. He had never actually seen grass, trees or a sunset, only the cold, oxygen thin closed asteroid enviorment.
<br />
<br /> He had been to Freeport 4 once. It was exiting! Ships moving here and there, coming in, going out.
<br />
<br /> one of the center's of commerce in all of the Bretonia/Liberty Border Worlds. After all, Curaco was for rich New London, Manhatten, and maybe a handul of California buiness men.
<br />
<br /> Besides tourism, mud baths, spa's and sonna's, it wasnt much in the way of commerce, exept taking luxury things there, and maybe returning with a travel procurde. 
<br />
<br />Thomas had never left Maggelan.
<br />
<br /> His entire family was on Mactan base, exept for his uncle. His uncle was one of the most jovial, funny people he had ever met. He always had a new joke, and some girlfriend.
<br />
<br /> He ran a freighter in between Mactan and the Hacker base up in Galileo. It was probably one of the most dangerous runs in all of Sirius, having to cross through two different Liberty systems.
<br />
<br /> He had the best Lane Hacker loadout you could get for his Dromedary. 
<br />
<br />His uncle was about ten years 18 years older than him. 
<br />
<br />Every time he came to Mactan, they would sit by their quarter's heater, Mom would be cooking one of here meals from captured food supplies, dad would be attempting to help her out, [key word, attempting and Uncle Jack would be sitting in our rocking chair our grandparents had left us, our grandparents were some of the original Hacker, Grandpa being working for those greedy Ageria ****s, after he left with his wife, they took alot of their possesions with them, living in ships til they had carved out all of Mactan Base, but anyway Uncle Jack would always tell a story or two, [we told him to purposly make them longer so we could stay up past our bed time, him and his sister, Jennifer. 
<br />
<br />  Thomas came back from his flash back to his early childhood. He was in The Mactan Main docking bay, going over his mental checklist, emergency supplies and h-fuel, his pistol, weapons,  nanobots and shield batteries, and his favorite, new coat of paint. He saw his friends loading up their Dagger's systems and such. He saw his buddy, just about to climb into the ship to his left. He walked over to Him
<br />
<br />&quot;Since when do we leave without our secret handshake?&quot; Thomas asked his buddy and roomate Jimmy Gerriagan.
<br />
<br />&quot;Not that I ever remembered.&quot; Jimmy smiled.
<br />
<br />They slapped their right hands, each crossed their right foot over their other foot, touching the ground with their toes. Brought their feet back, stomped the heel on the other side, did the same with the other foot, jumped in the air, &quot;HUH!&quot; they exclaimed at the same time, crossing their arms going back to back.
<br />
<br />   It took some time to master it, but after 17 years knowing each other from childhood, they were the secret handshake masters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good luck out there.&quot; Thomas wished his friend.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks you too, oh, and Tom do try and learn the difference between a trade lane and a jump gate will ya?&quot; Jimmy sarcastically joked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, your the one who was suspened from our only school for a week because you placed to much cardamine in the teacher's drink to convice her we could skip math class.&quot; Thomas happily reminesed.
<br />
<br />&quot;It was for the greater good of kid-kind!!&quot; Jimmy defended his childhood actions.
<br />
<br />&quot;Imhmm.&quot; Thomas shrugged.
<br /> 
<br />&quot;She sure didnt think so when she got down from it.&quot; Thomas laughed. &quot;We should get going, this sqaudron has a gold shipment to uh, liberate! yea thats the word!&quot; Thomas joked.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm the one who actually does things, and you just explain them, just like the cardamine. Some things,&quot; Jimmy signhed as they climed into their cockpits. &quot;Never change.&quot;</div>
