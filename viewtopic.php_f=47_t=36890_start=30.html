<br />Capital Ship Madley.

<br />'Sir, Technicians are reporting several failures on all the level 3 decks. Power is starting to go offline on level 2 as well.'
<br />
<br />'Run on minimal power and compensate. Emergency lights online.'
<br />
<br />'Sir... they exploded...'
<br />
<br />'WHAT ?'
<br />
<br />The Commander was shocked... even him knew less about his ship than the whole bridge. Then, the technician put online a video of engineering. It was a sort of computer room. 1 large bookshelf-like structure, holding several electronic devices. A control panel, and some wires/pipes running through the corridor - Or whatever was this place. It didn,t matter. Then, suddently, all the switches of the panel went to off or standby, whichever existed on the said switch. The monitors started darkening and shut down. The valves on the pipes bursted, passing thru the palm of the hand of an engineer passing by. Then, the end of the corridor started to collapse upon it's own weight, and the rest of the corridor quickly followed. The monitor's glass broke, and the camera's one did too. After that, it is suposed that the lenses died under pressure, because the film ended there.
<br />
<br />Everyone stood there, frozen in place. On the radar, a big blue light appeared, next to the ship. Slowly, the ship began its course toward it.
<br />
<br />'Engineers, deactivate Aux. Panels 235D to 267A on floor 2, reroute the power intake toward floor 4 instead of floor 3, and shut off the gas pipes ongoing toward the bottom of the ship. Order lockdown of all floors beside 2 and 1. Emergency lights only, power level must be minimal. Begin powering up cruise eng-............
<br />
<br />Time seemed to stop. The whole bridge was like a disco, all kinds of lights going through the glass applied themselves to the surface present here, and several BIG, WHITE flashes happened.
<br />
<br />....-ines. 
<br />
<br />The Commander began using his neutral net to set waypoint to Gas Miner Naha.
<br />
<br />*No known way found* *Failed* *Negative* *Refused* *Error* was all the Commander could get from the computer. Then, everyone stared at the giant window.
<br />
<br />'Where are we ? Unknown. The ship's radar is down. Setting course toward the nearest known base.'

			<div class="content">Name: Scout Elite Battleship Moonbeam
<br />Commander: Katok Haredni
<br />Location: Tau-29
<br />
<br />All defenders have vengences and magma hammers.
<br />
<br />Katok oversaw the scouting of an nebula in the system. Soon they would be done in the system and head through Kusari to the Sigma systems.
<br />&quot;Red Alert! Red Alert! Enemy ships approaching!&quot; Said the computerized voice of the battleship-wide nueral net.
<br />&quot;Ships appear to be... Outcasts.&quot; Said the radar operator.
<br />&quot;All ships return to the Moonbeam, these aren't the daggers we get back home.&quot; Katok said to his squadrons.
<br />&quot;We can't! These damn outcasts have stilletos and cruise disruptors!&quot; Katok racked his mind for a way out of this.
<br />&quot;Turn on your thruster then cut your engines.&quot; The squads quickly complied. Taking advantage of no cruise but high speed, the Defenders fired their turrets at the intruding outcasts. The outcasts got the message and sped away from the Defenders.
<br />&quot;Squads Alpha 1 through 4, you are cleared to dock.&quot; Katok waited for the squad leaders to come out. After they came out, he took them to the bridge.
<br />&quot;I hope you don't think I doubt your abilities, stilletos are just too much for you to do on your own.&quot; He explained. They nodded. The squadron commanders left for the equipment bay. Katok went to the command bridge and seered the Moonbeam toward the Kusari jump gate.</div>

			<div class="content">Battleship <i>Leviathan </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok Lieutenant what was THAT?!&quot;
<br />&quot;Well it looked like a liberty battleship&quot;
<br />The Commodore sighed &quot;after that?&quot;
<br />&quot;We don't know the probe appeared to get scrambled&quot;
<br />&quot;You mean we have to go and recover it?&quot;
<br />&quot;Well yes sir either that or the admiral&quot; The lieutenant muttered nervously
<br />&quot;How long would the jump take us?&quot;
<br />&quot;1 hour sir&quot;
<br />&quot;Ok set course and enter the jump hole I&#8217;ll check our fighters&quot;
<br />
<br />And with that the commodore go up from his chair and walked towards the door on the rear of the bridge turning back just in time to see space blur as the ship entered the jump hole
<br />
<br />A few minutes later he was walking round the large fish like fighters in the launch bay. The huge arched roof interior was a hive of activity with equipment dollies trundling around with equipment and ammo, crew men and woman went about there duties performing engine checks welding together micro meteorite crakes and so on. Through all this Jonathan picked out the tall sandy haired flight officer who lead 1036 squadron the <i>Leviathans </i> fighters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir&quot; said the flight officer and saluted
<br />&quot;At ease mate, tell me what&#8217;s the equipment load out of the fighters?&quot;
<br />&quot;4 ADV. Rippers and 2 ADV. Skyrails for guns, a starkiller torpedo, heavy thruster, IMP. Countermeasure dropper and a graviton shield (The most powerful a defender can mount i forget the name)
<br />&quot;So standard loadout then?&quot; Enquired the Commodore
<br />&quot;Yes sir!&quot;
<br />&quot;Why didn't you say so then?&quot;
<br />&quot;I though you would want a full inventory sir&quot;
<br />&quot;Woa calm down&quot; the commadore was about to call him son but he remembered that he was the youngest person on the ship, in fact the youngest person o ever command a battleship
<br />&quot;Meet me in the briefing room with your squad in 10 minutes&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes sir!&quot;
<br />&quot;Stop putting sir at the end of every sentence&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes sir&quot;
<br />The Commodore sighed this new crew would be the death of him
<br />
<br />10 minutes later the Commodore was standing in the middle of a circular room with a holo display in the center, around the edges many tiers rose up and on those tiers the fighter pilots were standing
<br />&quot;Now i know you&#8217;re all fresh from training and that this is your first assignment, so tell me what do you know about the outcasts?&quot;
<br />A brave pilot stood up and said &quot;They are worse then us at flying&quot;
<br />&quot;And why is that?&quot;
<br />&quot;We beat them in every simulation&quot; this brought a cheer to the other pilots
<br />&quot;And what were they flying in the simulation&quot;
<br />&quot;Daggers&quot; Realising that the Commodore was growing angry he said &#8220;We did once take out a stiletto&quot;
<br />&quot;Well my friend this is what you'll be seeing on the far side of this jumphole&quot;
<br />And with that a wire frame model of a Sabre popped up on the display
<br />&quot;These things will shoot you down in seconds so listen up, the best way you can deal with them is to out maneuver them they can beat you fire power wise so you'll have to use torps. in a tricky men..........&quot;
<br />At this point he was cut short by a comm clicking on
<br />&quot;Sir we have exited the jumphole early we are near another jump hole, tractoring probe now&quot;
<br />&quot;Show me on the display&quot;
<br />The central display showed a crackling nebula with a probe being tractord into there bay, then the far of jumphole seemed to leap forward and swallow the ship.
<br />
<br />Inside the ship was being rocked from side to side with conduits sparking and lights flickering, slowly the Commodore made his way to the bridge just in time to get into his chair before they were ****ed out of the jump tunnel
<br />&quot;Ugghh now were the hell are we.............?&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Commander Name: Will &quot;Apocalypse&quot; Rettek
<br />Squadron: Liberty Rouges Elite Fighter Squadron &quot;Spearhead&quot; (6 HF Wings)
<br />Location: Gailileo/Sigma 13
<br />
<br />All of Spearhead Squadron are their launching bays, ready to go.  Then, a message appears on the nueral net of every ship in the Squadron.
<br />
<br />&quot;Spearhead Squadron, this is Commander Apocalypse.  We have been given the go to launch.  Wait for the machine to give you clearence before you go.&quot;
<br />
<br />A automated voice echoes through the launching bays:
<br />
<br />&quot;Apocalypse Wing and Ultima Wing, you may now launch (they launch).  Death Wing and Pestilience Wing, you may launch (they launch).  War Wing and Famine Wing, you may launch (they launch).&quot;
<br />
<br />Spearhead Squadron are waiting outside of Padua, and once the whole Squadron is assembled they begin to fly toward the waypoint that was downloaded to their nueral nets.  Rick then turns on his communicator and makes a secure channel for the Squadron to talk through.  Then he begins to talk to Apocalypse.
<br />
<br />&quot;So Will, what is the object of this mission?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, a Rouge patrol recently passed a unknown jump hole.  They wanted us to check it out, as there may be danger on the other side.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A new jump hole, huh?  I wonder where it could go.....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;As long as we get paid, I don't care where it goes.&quot;  Another voice grumbled in a Rhineland accent.  It was Erwin Von Sturr, a deserter from the Rhineland Military who joined up with the Rouges after he escaped the Police by heading into Liberty.  The most important thing to him is money, and he will do any job for a price.  Although Apocalypse doesn't particually like his view of life, Erwin is an excellent pilot so he learned to put up with him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Come on Er, try having some fun for once.  It's not often we get to go on simple missions like these.&quot;  Another voice declared cheerfully.  This pilot, Jess Smith, was one of the younger Rouges, and is about the same age of Apocalypse, 18.  Despite her age she is an amazing pilot, and is very cheery and optimistic.  Although she doesn't know it, Apocalypse has taken a liking to her, a fact he keeps a secret to all, but Rick has begun to figure it out.
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't call me Er, my name is Erwin.  And what good does fun do you anyway?  There is no money to be obtained by having fun.&quot;  Erwin said angrily.
<br />
<br />&quot;You're hopeless, Er.&quot;  Jess said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok Squadron, no time to be arguing now, we are aproching the jump hole.  I will go in first, then Rick, and then Erwin.  Wait for one of us to jump back and tell you it's safe before you go.  If it's safe, go one by one and Jess, you hold up the rear.  If we don't come back, Jess you lead the others back to Padua and tell them what happened.  Ok, lets move!&quot;  Apocalypse said.
<br />
<br />Apocalypse, Rick and Erwin go through the Jump Hole.  The rest of the Squadron waits in Gailieo for one of them to return.  After about 3 minutes, the Jump Hole opens again and Apocalypse flies in.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's looks safe.  Strangely enough, this Jump Hole goes straight to Sigma-13.  It could be useful to us later on.  If we built a base there, the h-fuel that we could make through the resources there would greatly help our economy.  Let's go and check out the surrondingn area.&quot; Apocalypse said.
<br />
<br />They all go through the jump hole, and enter formation.  They explore the area for a little while, until gunshots are heard ahead of them.  When they inspect more closely, they see 12 Sabres fighting a Liberty Battleship and a few wings of Liberty HFs.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wow, what is a Liberty Battleship doing in Sigma-13?  And who are those ships fighting it?&quot;  Jess said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know what the Battleship is doing here, but those fighters attacking it are Outcast ships.  We haven't been on too good of terms with the Outcasts since the Cardimine ban, but they are still better than Liberty.  Let's see if they need help!&quot; Apocalypse said.  &quot;Outcasts, this is Spearhead Squadron leader Apocalypse.  Do you need any help against that Battleship?&quot;
<br />
<br />(OOC: Ok Outcast, your turn.)</div>

<br />____________________
<br />Bundschuh Guerilla Squadron Theta 1, 2, and 3
<br />Location: Dresden
<br />
<br />Erich's wing soared through the orange-yellow clouds of Dresden having just completed another mission successfully and without fail. Not even a shield down on this one--the poor bastards they had assassinated were guarded by nothing more than a couple of starfliers. Anyways, some corrupt official was dead, far from civilization. The Bundschuh was one step closer to its ultimate goal.
<br />
<br />&lt;Demon Fires, this is Berne. High Command has orders for you. Please Dock at Vogtland for briefing concerning this mission&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Roger that, Berne. We're on our way.&gt; Erich switched channels. &lt;Demon Fires 1 and 2, this is Fires leader. Change of Plans. We'll rendezvous at Vogtland.&gt; The pending orange mist muffled all sound surrounding the ships, and Erich relaxed in his cockpit in the silence. Rhineland was crumbling.
<br />
<br />Erich met his commisioner, Stel von Vergaart, at the bar on Vogtland. He was a middle-aged, balding man who had been close friends with Erich's father. Vergaart looked like he would have been pathetically weak on the battlefield, but Erich knew better. This man was one of the champions of the Bundschuh.
<br />
<br />&quot;Erich. Good, you made it. Take a seat. Let me guess--Darkhundt Lager, right? Waiter! great. Now, to business. You remember our contacts with the Order. Of course you do, your father. How could I forget?  They need something...artifacts. Several artifacts.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So...you want us to travel to Corsair territory, discreetly pick up the artifacts and fly back with them in the cargo holds disguised as fertilizers?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, no they already have a shipper moving the artifacts. The only thing is, its against the will of the Corsairs. So the shippers have a high likelihood of being attacked while they're on their way, and we can't let that happen. The Order needs those artifacts.
<br />
<br />We've heard of these shippers, the Merry Men, and we know theres another job we need them to do. We also know there's not a high likelihood of their taking the deal unless we give them a reason--besides credits, of course--to do it. Protecting them from Corsairs is a good reason to help us ship the documents.&quot;
<br />
<br />Erich sighed. &quot;We're no escorts, we're guerillas. But I'll take it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good man. You'll go to Omega 11, jump to 41 and wait by the jump hole for the transports to come. I'll also send two more Sabre wings out to help you. Try not to engage any Corsairs.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you sir&quot; Erich straightened himself up, finished off his beer, and walked back to the equipment room.
<br />
<br />&quot;And Stalner...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Say hi to Von Claussen from me.&quot;

			<div class="content">IC: Battleship Canada.
<br />
<br />As the battleship started to slowly gain power, the jumphole behind it literally exploded. There was very little hope someone would travel on the other side, as it exploded as well, by the sensors' calculations. The battleship was pushed forward, thanksfully toward a tradelane.
<br />
<br />'Well, the Navy reaaallly had a good reason for this investigation'
<br />
<br />'This is Beta Sigma Charlie to Tau Lamba 6872D, I need immediate assistance from the Rheinland Navy. Please lay low with it.'
<br />
<br />'*Click*'
<br />
<br />'Alright. The tradelane will transfert the communication. Try to reactivate power on floor 2 and 4, and send an investigation team down here. Be sure that there is always 3 men per team.'
<br />
<br />'Yes sir!'.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alert! Bundchuh ships spotted! ALl men to battlestations!&quot;, the battleship-wide communication system shout.
<br />
<br />The bundshush ship approached and dropped a few torpedos. Thanksfully, the missile turrets tracked them and destroyed it. After that, the defense and flak turrets took care of the Daggers, while the secondary and primary turrets took care of the Stilettos.
<br />
<br />** Warning : Engine failed ** blinked on the Engineer's Officer screen. Several red and yellow lights appeared on his control panel, and he flicked several switches to off to fix the problem.
<br />
<br />'Sir, we've lost a rear-end panel!'
<br />
<br />'Damnit. Use the thrusters to set course toward tradelane, we have to dock!'
<br />
<br />A last salva of turrets took care of the last ennemies, and the tractor beam looted in the weapons and ammo. The corpses were destroyed by the flak turrets. THere was no more place for prisoneer, because the whole jail had been destroyed.
<br />
<br />Heading toward the tradelane, BS canada started the activation sequence, and initiated the lane jump. At the end of the lane, all movement has been reduced to nothing, and the ship was almost in a wreckage state. The tractor beam tracked every bolt, screw and small panels it could. But the repairs would cost a lot.
<br />
<br />/End post.

			<div class="content">&quot;Reliable&quot; Randy Sega and the Merry Men
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The trip to Omicron Theta was uneventful. Too uneventful. Randy couldn't help but get the feeling that is was the calm before the storm. Still, the Merry Men were busy loading their ships with the artifacts and so far nothing had gone wrong. <i>Thank space for small blessings, I guess. </i> He thought as he surveyed Freeport 9's docking area. He and his squad all agreed that getting this mission over and done with as quickly as possible was the best plan. As such the docking bays were living incarnations of orgaized chaos. People were running seemingly willy-nilly from place to place, deperately trying to get their part of the job done. There hadn't been any major league collision as of yet though so the loading was progressing nicely.
<br />
<br />&quot;What are you thinking right now?&quot; Georgina had come up behind Randy and slipped her arms around her waist.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Randy sighed contentedly. &quot;A permanent cabin on the <i>Hawaii </i> would be nice. And after this mission we'll definitely have enough money.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And then some.&quot; Georgina said. &quot;But would you really give up flying?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hell no.&quot; A new voice interjected. It was Arnold Masterson, one of three former Bounty Hunters currently working for the Merry Men. Arnold and his siblings, Doug and Lisa, all came from the mean streets of Texas. They quickly worked their way up the criminal heirarchy of Texas, eventually becoming some of the most wanted unaffiliated criminals in all Liberty. That sort of attention got them caught, though not without some serious effort on the part of the various Liberty security services. It was the LSF who finally managed to nab the Mastersons but, instead of locking them away for good, High Command offered to set them free if they would agree to become Bounty Hunters. Not wanting to give up their freedom, the Mastersons agreed. They quickly racked up an impressive kill score, a fact that attracted the ire of many long-time members of the Guild. Soon the Mastersons found themselves under fire from criminals and fellow hunters. Randy was heading through Sigma-19 when he came across the three siblings. They were fighting a force of Bounty Hunters more than 4 times their size. The Masterson's had one advantage though. Their strength increased exponentially with each sibling. Where one may have been good enough to take on two or three fighters alone, two could take on at least 9 and three were parctically untouchable. Randy saw that this was a winning combination and immediately put them all on the short-list.
<br />
<br />&quot;Haha, yeah.&quot; Randy said. &quot;Arnold's right. But I'd sure as hell quit working. Maybe get myself a nice Eagle off the Zoners and just go for joyrides every so often.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Maybe.&quot; Arnold said. &quot;For now you might want to know that the crews are almost finished loading and we're going to start prepping for launch.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hmmm. Good idea. I'll be off then, love. See you in space.&quot; Georgina released Randy and jogged towards her ship, Beta Train.
<br />
<br />Randy nodded to Arnold and the two men went their separate ways, Randy to his Train, Arnold to his Bounty Hunter Piranha. As Randy clambered up the ladder to his cockpit the crew cheif signalled that the loading procedures were finished and the deck-hands were clear. Randy hopped into his chair and began running the startup sequence.
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay guys, time to run 'em up.&quot; Randy announced over the comms. &quot;Freeport Nine this is Merry Men Alpha. Request permission to launch.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Acknowledged Merry Men Alpha. Good Journey.&quot; Came the controller's reply. Docking bay doors opened and mooring lines fell away.
<br />
<br />&quot;So boss, how we gonna get to this Nansei place?&quot; Manny asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;We'll take the jumphole to Sigma-17, then it's on to Sigma-19 and then Kusari space.&quot; Randy answered. &quot;Form up on me and hit your cruise engines, people. It'll take a while to get to the jumphole and I don't want to waste time.&quot;
<br />
<br />The comm squawked with 20 simultaneous acknowledgements as everyone went to cruise. The Merry Men tore across space towards the jumphole. Suddenly Randy's Neural Net pinged.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh, guys,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm getting a tight beam transmission. It's...it's from the Bundschuh...&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">OOC: Still waiting for the battle report.
<br />
<br />To wilde (OOC): You said this <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>OOC: Outcast, just so you know, Bundschuh are the only faction with a constant supply of Sunslayers. Criminal factions like Outcasts and Corsairs can have them, just not a lot.
<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />However, this means nothing, as I remind you of a few facts:
<br />
<br />Blood Dragons fly dragons, but do not sell them
<br />Blood Dragons sell hawks, and don't fly them
<br />Lord Hakkera had a Dagger, and a Sabre.
<br />GMG fly hawks, falcons and eagles and do not sell them.
<br />Rouges sell the Dagger, but Outcasts and other factions use it.
<br /><b>All stations sell Sunslayer Ammo  </b>
<br />
<br />Therefore, many factions don't sell their own ships or weapons, but still use them. The reason for this is that they don't all export their goods. The Blood Dragons make dragons only for themselves, yet they also make Hawks, which they sell for profit. In fact, the Bundusch are the only self-sufficent faction (apart from navies and police) in the whole game.
<br />
<br />I think this justifies me using Sunslayers. If not, come shoot me.
<br />
<br />I'd also like to point out that you are flying Sabres, and I've never seen Bundusch fly Sabres. (only Hessians and Outcasts)

<br />OOC: If you want to RP a NOMAD fleet to blow him up go ahead, thats going to be the punishment for god modding.
<br />
<br />Wilde I think you will find this style of RPG a very refreshing style of play, CYOF is great, but this allows for a lot more creativity.
<br />
<br />Oh btw this goes for everyone, you can all occasionally use sunslayers, and they will only be slightly more powerful than other vessels, but Bundusch is the only ones who have steady supply of them.

<br />I believe that wraps it up <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> lol
<br />
<br />And I've seen Bundschuh fly Sabres. The more experienced types. Generally the Bundschuh fly stilletos.
<br />
<br />Back In Character:
<br />
<br />20 Sabres lay still in the darkness of Omega 41.
<br />
<br />Vergaart's voice crackled over the intercom. &lt;Stalner? This is Vergaart. Change of plans. The Merry Men are picking up the artifact at Freeport 9. Omicron Theta. Escort them to Honshu through Sigma 19 and from there down to their base in New York. Maintain utmost secrecy! We can't afford to have a battle on our hands. Vergaart out.&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Roger that. Demon Fires, power up engines. I'm setting a waypoint a little way ahead of here--there's a jumphole that'll get us to Omicron Theta in no time flat.&gt;

			<div class="content">The battle for Freeport 9 was raging when Jason arrived with 3 wings of Corsair Titans.
<br />
<br />&quot;Holy...Pick your targets men&quot; Jason said
<br />
<br />&quot;Happy to see you Jason!&quot; One of his men said. 
<br />
<br />The Battle quickly turned to the Zoners favour when a stolen  Corsair cruiser arrived.
<br />After the battle Jason quickly tractored in the loot that was lying around,
<br />Two Kraken type 2 and a couple of missiles was lying around.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Freeport 9, We thank the Corsairs for the help and commander Willis is on the secure channel Jason.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;JASON! The Outcasts came here looking for you!! They are not happy about you telling the Corsairs about the jump hole.
<br />They have declared war on any faction hiding you so we are kicking you out from the Zoners!
<br />Im sorry but it is the only way for us to survive.We need to be neutral with all factions or we are screwed.
<br />Commander willis out!&quot;
<br />
<br />Jason sank down in to his chair.
<br />
<br />&quot;Cheer up Boss we are with you. Screw the Zoners lets explore Sirius.&quot; Delta 1 said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I guess you are right...set a course for the sigma 17 jump hole.&quot;</div>
