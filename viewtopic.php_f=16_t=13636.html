			<div class="content">Everybody has heard of the famous wreck of the Hispania. But what do we really know about it? We know that the Hispania fell victim to a sabotage. But what  really happened? How was the ship sabotaged? Armed with photographs of specific areas of the Hispania, (if some one knows how to put them here please tell me, I'm new at this, I don't have a website) I have decided to follow in the footsteps of John Brown, an ace investigator who has posted an intriguing essay on this forum. You should visit it if you haven't yet. It is titled, &quot;Essay on Monkeys, Robots, The Order, Dom Kavash, Post Lvl. 17 Missions, and Black Holes&quot; Please read it if you have time.
<br />
<br />When I first saw the Hispania (which I heard so much of) I wanted to do something that no one has done before, in order to better understand what happened, I took a closer look. I took some pictures too.
<br />
<br />[img_Hispania_Arrow_Front
<br />
<br />As you can see, (#1) the side of the Hispania hit something, such as an asteroid or something in that sense. There is also a hole cut deep in the side of the ship. 
<br />
<br />[img_Hispania_Arrow_Back
<br />
<br />This next picture, which shows 2 engines (A and B ) and a hole in the center with an obsturction in it is what I am led to believe is evidence of an explosion which destroyed the center engine. The obstruction is the remnants of the center engine. 
<br />
<br />[img_Hispania_Arrow_Inside
<br />
<br />This is a picture of the inside where the hole in the side of the ship is. It seems that the explosion (caused by a bomb or some other device) blasted through the narrow tunnel and, assuming that the area was damaged during the exodus, blew off that part just before reaching the pods (C). the pressure left over from the explosion, not the explosion itself, blew off the nose of the ship not harming the passangers.
<br />
<br />[img_Hispania_Arrow_Pods
<br />
<br />This is a picture of the front (made valid by the fin on the lower left). You can see that the pressure popped the top off, again, there is no evidence that the pods were damaged or blown away.
<br />
<br />Here is the full story. Shortly before the launch, a Coalition spy tried to set bombs on the sleeper ships. He/She managed to plant one, on the engine of the Hispania, but during the surprise attack by the Coalition on Jupiter, the Alliance was forced to launch the sleeper ships one right after the other (as seen in the introduction cinematic) frying the spy to crispy nonperfection. Breaking through the Coalition blockade (against all odds) they must have damaged the Hispania's left side (which makes sense because all of the sleeper ships were in the background in the introduction cinematic). With the Britionia's engine damaged, (as they tell us) there is no doubt that the Coalition had the firepower to damage any part of the sleeper ships.
<br />When the Hispania arrived at the Omicron Alpha system, (pre-determined by the ship's on-board computer) The bomb, having a speed guage fuse, sensed the stop and blew. This explosion rocked through the ship, blew off the damaged left side of the ship, funneling the power of the explosion out (hence the debris field on the left side on the ship). The steam pressure then blew the cap off the ship, not harming the frail human cargo.
<br />The Hispanians (assuming they had space suits on) left the pods and took whatever provisions and supplies they could. The Outcasts landed on Malta and the Corsairs flew to the other system.
<br />
<br />If anyone would like to varify or clarify this claim, I would like to know what I missed or inaccurate information.
<br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />
<br />Knock, knock 
<br />Who&#8217;s there? 
<br />A talking pig. 
<br />Pigs can&#8217;t talk. 
<br />Neither can penguins, but I can&#8217;t shut him up[! Wait till you get a load of the dancing candelabra&#8230;

			<div class="content">The rumors say that the Corsairs bailed during flight, and the Outcasts rode it out until the ship stopped, so I would assume that the bomb blew before Omicron Alpha (maybe sensing slowdown, but not destination) and when that happened the Corsairs took off in escape pods in Omicron Gamma. The ship then limped to Omicron Alpha and the Outcasts settled on nearby Malta.</div>

			<div class="content">Okay, the Outcasts do not have enough military might to take over the houses in a 'standard' war if you will. So they have engineered a way to make them the dominant force in Sirus. They are trying to get the majority of the population hooked on Cardamine. As it alters the genome to make the user <b>need </b> it to live, the Outcasts would have power over everybody as they are the chief suppliers of the drug. Catch my drift?</div>

			<div class="content">The Poor Poor Hispania. I drilled the poor rumor spreders on Malta and Crete to Death. THis is what I know. 
<br />
<br />The Alliance in a desperate action seeking to surivive, Built 8 Sleeper ships,
<br />The Bretonia
<br />The Liberty
<br />The Kusari
<br />The Rhienland
<br />The Hispania
<br />Unkown
<br />Unkown
<br />Unkown
<br />
<br />Suddenly The Coalitions Forces Came in a large force and attacked. the Alliance had to rush. Only Five Made it through, The Bretonia, Liberty, Kusari, Rhienland and Hispania. While Four of them sped away in Safety something was going wrong on The Hispania. It had been Sabotaged. It is not known when It was Sabotaged but suddenly they were all woken up. They had to hold a meeting. Half the crew  (later called The Corsairs)decided to leave in the shuttle craft (guessing they were maybe were larger) and left The ruined ship. Half the crew stayed on board (Known as outcasts) and kept it running till they sighted a habitable planet (at least with a breathable atmosphere(Known now as Malta). The others had finally found a planet with a breathable atmosphere too(Now Known As Crete). Now they were left to thier fate. 50% of each faction died in two years.
<br />CORSAIRS FATE
<br />After planetfall they made a home for themselves. They only had the ships rations to feed them. 2 Years later they ran out of food. The family heads had a discussion. One of the families (family names from surivived crew) was to be eaten. One was finally chosen and they Survived. 300 Years later they made contact with the rest of Sirius. They started attacking them. They attacked cargo ships which got them supplies. They would have more people if it were not for a tradition they have. In a nearby nebula the young children had to seek an artefact. If they managed to have survived it with their artefact they became part of the corsairs. Some died while trying to get their artefacts and never came back. I am not sure what happened to ones that came back without thier artefact. (probably not allowed to come back until they got it). One thing that Corsairs do with caputured enemies (truse me i would rather be dead) is they would keelhaul them, in other words putting them in a vac suit tied to a corsair ship and then the corsair ship would go through a jump hole... not pretty.
<br />
<br />THE OUTCASTS.
<br />When the crew that decided to stay on board  got to a planet, they found one with Orange grasses. The only thing that grew in the acidic soil was the grass. (i am not sure how they procured food.) They sent out foraging parties but they had never come back again. rescue parties found out why. The grass was razor sharp. they would have gotten lacerated walking through the grass and ended up bleeding to death. They found out when they got into space they could not leave for long without getting withdrawl sympotms. They had to get breathers filled with cardamine gas. They had thought that one of the sleeper ships had gotten a sabotuer aboard so as to lessen the competiton for resources. They wanted to get the entire population of sirius back. They had found a way. Cardamine. It altered the users so that they became utterly and uselessly addicted to it. Cardamine is thier way of getting back at the sirius secotr. The corsairs want to kill the sirius sector off.</div>
