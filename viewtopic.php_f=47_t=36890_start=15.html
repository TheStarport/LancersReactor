			<div class="content">This sounds like it's gonna be fun.  Here's my first post:
<br />
<br />Speaerhead Squadron Ship Equipment: 5 Vassago Lasers, 1 Thoth Turrent, 1 Hornet Cruise Disruptor, 1 Starkiller Torpedo Launcher, 1 Screamer Mine Dropper, 1 Advanced Countermeasure Dropper, 1 Barrier HF Shield, 1 Advanced Thruster, and full ammo for all ammo using weapons.  Ships are modified to hold better weapons and shields, have 2 hardpoints for Torpedos and Cruise Disruptors, has more armor and power for weapons, and can hold more nanobots and shield batteries.
<br />
<br />Apocalypse walks into the Padua Bar.  He looks around, as if he was expecting someone.  Then he walks up to the bartender and begins to talk to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good day sir.  Would you like something to drink?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You know I don't drink John.  Have you seen Rick anywhere?  He told me he would meet me here but I don't see him.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah yes, he was here about 10 minutes ago, sir.  He told me to tell you to meet him at Docking Bay 4.  He said that he and the rest of your squadron would wait for you there.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I see.  I suppose it would be hard to bring the whole squadron into the bar.  Still, he could have at least waited for me here while the rest went to the docking bay.  O well, it doesn't matter.  Thank you John.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Anytime, sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />Apocalypse steps out of the bar and walks through Padua until he reaches Docking Bay 4.  He steps into the hanger and sees 23 people standing there, along with 24 modified Wolfhounds behind them.  One, a tall burly man, steps up to Apocalypse and begins to talk to him.  By his tone of voice and choice of words, you can tell that he is a good friend of Apocalypse.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, you finally made it up here, huh Will?  If you would have been any slower we might have left without you!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well Rick, if you would've waited for me at the bar I may have not of been so late.  Besides, if you waited and they left at least they would have the privilage of leaving you behind!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;WHAT!  Leaving me behind a privilage?  I am twice the pilot you will ever be Will!  And I will prove whenever you want, wherever you want!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ha ha ha ha ha!  I will take you up on that offer Rick, but now is not the time.  We need to get started on our mission.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I guess you are right Will.  Will we need all 6 wings on this one?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That is what it says in the mission briefing.  They have given us Launching Bays 1, 2, and 3 to use.  So Apocalypse wing and Ultimia wing will go to 1, Death Wing and Pestilence Wing go to 2, and War Wing and Famine Wing go to 3.  Let's move out!&quot;
<br />
<br />All the members of Spearhead Squadron get into there ships and go to the launching bay they were assigned to.  They are waiting until they are given the go to launch.

			<div class="content">A quartet of long slender fighters glided through the green nebula in the Omicron Gamma System.  The commander of the wing kept his eyes open.  Their had been reports of an infestation.  The Corsairs had attributed the deaths of several of their pilots to the Bounty Hunters Guilds new weapon and they had publicized the existence of these vessels highly throughout the underground circles in an effort to get information on them.  A reward was offered for one of these craft, a description was given, a semi-translucent vessels of a wedge like shape.  It was clear, the Corsairs had a NOMAD problem.  It was the Order's job to fix it.
<br />
<br />The Anubis craft was an extremely advanced vessel, but if the Titan a craft nearly equal in abilities to it could be defeated against these NOMAD fighters, they had to be cautious.  &#8220;Lead, this is four, I have a large bogie on my screen, BHG, its going weapons hostile.&#8221; said the pilot of the fourth anubis.  &#8220;Six hammerheads total.&#8221; they have accelerated to attack speed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Aff&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;Hit cruise engines, we don't need the Bounty Hunters out for revenge on our hides.&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Incoming cruise disruptors. I can't shake 'em.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The lead pilot of the Anubis wing suddenly swung his ship around 180 degrees and let out a burst from hits cannons at the lead hunter.  BH 1 went into a lazy arc to avoid fire.  The two behind him fired their guns at the anubis which went into a barrel role hitting its afterburners.  The skilled Order pilot systematically punched holes in both shields as it engaged them, supplying his shields with a steady recharge of shield batteries.   His shouts proved successful.  Each ships weapons were reduced by fifty percent.  The other three Anubis's broke off and engaged the 4 that their lead had not engaged.  Laser bolts flew out in all directions from the gas clouds.  The frenzy of combat would have been near impossible to track.
<br />
<br />Two bright blue explosions appeared through the green gas.  Anubis 4 and BHG 6 both were taken off the radar as two vessels appeared.  The vessels were moving at incredible speed towards them.  Three more appeared from a different area.  The BHG units began to flee as the three order vessels paired up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;All, this is Order Lead.  This is the moment we've been waiting for lets get these bastards.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;2 here, fox 4-2&#8221; he said as the pilot pressed in a button firing a pair of two missiles fired off towards one of the incoming NOMAD fighters.  The NOMAD barrel roled to its starboard side then pulled up as the two missiles streamed past it.  It then fired two azure bolts from behind hitting both the missiles as they turned around back towards it as two orange exploded.
<br />
<br />The NOMADs continued to to close in on them.  They then openned up with their weapons.  It was as if an entire salvo of shotguns had gone off in front of the Order fighters consuming them.  They were utterly destroyed.  The vessels continued onward towards Crete and they were not alone...</div>

			<div class="content">As BS Canada arrived to Sigma-13, 2 wings of Heavy Fighters were immediatly dispatched to investigate about the jumphole. The BS followed them closely, blowing away the explosives gazes, rheinland wreckages and the like.
<br />
<br />'This is Gas Miner Naha station, please identify yourself Beta Sigma Charlie.'
<br />
<br />'This is Beta Sigma Charlie, we are heading toward coordinates C.9 3.6, investigating a jumphole. We have authorization for it, over'
<br />
<br />'Acknowledged, Beta Sigma Charlie. Authorization granted. We will be sending repair ships and a cargo transport, along with a wing of heavy fighters. Welcome to Sigma-13'
<br />
<br />'Thanks you GMN, your help is appreciated.'
<br />
<br />Soonly, three bright dots popped up on the tactical operations command console. As the officer in charge of the computer flicked several switches to concentrate the scanners toward it, the defense officer aimed the primary turret toward the convoy, while keeping the defense turrets on normal duty. The Commander didn't like imperfections, and like said before, he thought this was good training for his men.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Battleship Canada, Cargo bay :
<br />
<br />Mr. Hanks was accompaning the incoming convoy's personnel toward their quarters, while he told the tech. guy to talk to a man. As he pointed his finger toward this said man, the technician nodded.
<br />
<br />'Sir, we are having several power failures throughout the ship. Deck 5 to 22 are offline, on floor 3. We do not know where the problem is.'
<br />
<br />'Acknowledged.'
<br />
<br />'The password to maintenance is 8359, try to remem-.....'
<br />
<br />They walked toward the various failures of the ship.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />In the engineering section, the technician dropped his welding unit, as he shout the biggest cry of his life. His muscles went all dead, and his nerves began sending electric signals violently. The veins of his head literally exploded, and his heart began pumping more and more blood, while spitting an even bigger amount, after which all it did was pumping air, and eventually dieing. Technician's lower body was all crap and pee, and his pupils were almost completly filling his iris.

			<div class="content">Maria's Sabre vaulted out of the New York jumpgate. Little space traffic clouded the pure starridden Liberty sky, as currently most of the system was soundly asleep. The occaisional police patrol filtered through--fortunately none of them had even heard of the Bundschuh--uselessly scanning her empty cargo hold. Checking her neural net, she set a waypoint at Trenton Outpost and guided her ship towards the trade rings. 
<br />
<br />The journey there had been a fairly exciting journey. A farfetched Federal Police patrol in Hudson very nearly ended her mission then and there. It was only her heavy stock of CM Flares that guided off the cruise disruptors.
<br />
<br />As her ship was dumped out of one trade lane and moved towards the next, she remembered the events that lead to her being so far away from Rhineland.
<br />
<br />_______________________________
<br />
<br />Erich had approached her room earlier in the evening. He had clearly meant to askher something, but seemed in no hurry to leave her quarters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good work out there today. Some of my veterans don't fly that well.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks.&quot; Maria always took praise and compliment this way--cool, controlled, matter-of-fact. She was a practical woman.
<br />
<br />&quot;I, uh...um....&quot; For once in his life, Erich Stalner forgot what he was about to say as what was, in his mind, an incarnation of a goddess stood before him.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry Herr Stalner. Am I intimidating you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Call me Erich. No, no...it's just...&quot; Erich had forgotten all about the Merry Men.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, that's it. One of the guys out there told me you...um...It's just I didn't think--&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Erich sighed. &quot;That's something that went on five years ago. The guy's stationed at Bruschal now, so we don't see much of each other. But some people--like Hans or Mueller--don't forget anything. Even if its dead and buried.
<br />
<br />Anyways, I need you to do something. We...have an informant, a well-known essayist of sorts operating in Bretonia, at Cambridge. Spreading propaganda about Rhineland. He's quite well known in the Institute community. But recently he was forced to go into hiding so we haven't been able to contact him over the Net. He's still publishing essays for scientific journals, but now we have a collection of documents to really expose the truth about Rhineland's corruption. If those documents are published soon Bretonia, Liberty, and even Kusari will be up in arms against Rhineland, making way for a government overturn. We need to get the documents to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;We could hijack a transport...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It's not that simple. We need to do this in the most normal, legal way possible. There's a group, the Merry Men, lead by Randy Sega, that we think can ship the documents for us if we bribe them a little. Like stoking a fire.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Which is where I come in, right? You want me to find their leader, approach him with an offer, keep pushing him and finally seduce him if he doesn't give in?&quot; Maria started to get a little impatient at the roundabout way Erich was presenting it. Almost like he was determined to spend every minute possible there talking to her.
<br />
<br />&quot;In a word--yes. We thought your experience in diplomacy with the Rhineland government could help us out.&quot;
<br />
<br />_______________________
<br />
<br />Nearing Trenton, she was still shocked Erich had fallen for her. Her of all people!
<br />
<br />Anyways, it was irrelevant. She guided her Sabre into the docking bay. &quot;Now to find Herr Sega.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Dresden&#8217;s main star immediately blinded the Geschwin as it cleared the bay doors, forcing Damien to focus his attention on a rounded screen to the left of the command console. He stared at several green blips, constantly darting around the small monitor, and turned several dials to ensure that the center red dot remained a fair distance from all of the others. Suddenly, half of the screen was covered by a single, giant object, and Damien struggled to see out of the Geschwin&#8217;s forward window.
<br />
<br />*PPPPPFFFF*
<br />
<br />Another ship collided with the starboard side of Damien&#8217;s armored transport, violently throwing the Geschwin off-course. The large green object slowly drifted off the corner of the screen, with many smaller, brown dots appearing in its place. Damien could once more see, with the Geschwin&#8217;s bow now facing the gradually shrinking Bautzen Station. He struggled desperately to maneuver his ship so that he would avoid hitting anything that displayed on his monitor.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Must your accommodations be so inhospitable!&#8221; cried out a muffled voice, &#8220;I cannot stress how difficult it is to maintain balance with you driving like the maniac that you apparently are!&#8221;
<br />
<br />By now the Geschwin had entered Bautzen&#8217;s surrounding asteroid field, and Damien flicked every switch he could reach in hopes of slowing the ship&#8217;s backwards descent. A red light near the command console began blinking rapidly, a sign that the Geschwin&#8217;s cruise engines had been disabled.
<br />
<br />*PPPPUUUUH*
<br />
<br />An asteroid clipped the Geschwin&#8217;s stern, causing the entire vessel to rotate a full fifty degrees before slamming into the asteroid again. Several more lights began blinking, indicated multiple mechanical failures. The command console lit up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Bautzen Port Authority; respond with your current situation!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Damien reached for the radio with his spare hand, forced to do what little maneuvering he could with the other. He barely managed to press down on the transmit button before the Geschwin broke free of the asteroid, jolting the entire ship once more. The radio fell to the floor while Damien reached over to kill the engines.
<br />
<br />Instantly all engines went offline, with the Geschwin maintaining its speed until it collided into one of the largest asteroids. The collision managed to hook the asteroid and Geschwin together, once more changing the ship&#8217;s course. With his vessel heading back towards Bautzen station, Damien pressed the emergency lighting button, causing the blinking red lights that covered the exterior of the Geschwin to turn on. He then pushed himself quickly from his seat, flipped the cargo door switch to &#8216;off&#8217;, and rushed over to the slight opening which had been made at the back side of the cabin.</div>

			<div class="content">To say Freeport 2 was dull would've been an understatement. Located precisely in the middle of nowhere it really had nothing going for it. The ice fields of Bering were nothing short of mind-numbing and the general company was no better. And Randy had almost another day and a half before his scheduled meeting. He wasn't happy, and his Merry Men weren't either. They were seated around a large table, each one complaining in turn.
<br />
<br />&quot;Man, I don't know how we let you drag us here.&quot; Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Jimenez groused. A former Corsair, Manny had one of the most interesting histories of all the Merry Men. He was the scion of a minor Corsair noble who had the infamous distinction of having led what was probably the most ineffective and ill-advised coup attempt in the history of all mankind. Manny was the sole survivor of the purge that followed and, as such, felt no loyalty to the Corsairs. He didn't feel any particular animosity either, of course, as his father well and truly had been an idiot.
<br />
<br />&quot;Shut up,&quot; another voice rumbled, &quot;you voted for this too.&quot; Leo Graifer was living proof that opposites do attract. Whereas Manny was small, dark skinned and generally excitable, Leo had all the characteristics of an iceberg. He was big, white and didn't really do much until you ran into him, at which point you'd probably die. Those differences didn't keep the men from becoming fast friends though. In fact, the two were almost inseparable. The other Merry Men had taken to calling them Mr. and Mrs. though no-one would say who was which.
<br />
<br />&quot;Why don't we do something instead of just wasting away here?&quot; One of the female pilots, Georgina McAllister, asked. When Randy first found the Bretonian woman she was hauling scrap metal to Stokes in Leeds. Randy was just leaving when the Mollys launched one of their clockwork raids on the smelting station. Georgina had just arrived in her Clydesdale and found herself under fire from multiple hostiles. She handled herself incredibly, sweeping through the Mollys and barely taking a scratch. Frank had never seen anyone make a freighter move the way she had (then again, it's a little hard to watch your own handiwork). He knew that whoever the pilot was, he would be a valuable addition to the team. Randy issued an invitation and was a bit surprised to find that the pilot was, in fact a she. When the two finally met, it was love at first sight - for Randy at least. Georgina was nothing short of beautiful and an exceptional pilot to boot. Getting her to join his squad proved to be quite easy, getting her to warm up to him was more difficult. Nevertheless, after almost a year of trying Randy finally succeeded, Georgina relented, and the two of them have been a couple ever since.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good idea.&quot; One of the Kusari members of the squad, Tokugawa Masatohari, said. &quot;But what is there to do here? The Xenos and Unioners here are a decidedly boring lot.&quot; A former member of the Hogosha, Gawa - as he was affectionately known - had been drafted in large part due to his extensive knowledge of the criminal underbelly of Sirius. He had contacts almost everywhere and could pull up information about nearly everything. He was also a killer pilot, weaving around enemy fire and scoring surgical hits on the enemy. It was not unusual for seemingly undamaged craft to simply stop in mid-flight around Gawa. His shots had an uncanny tendency to blast through the cockpit window, instantly vapourizing the enemy pilot as soon as the sheilds fell.
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's check out the meeting place. Make sure it's not a trap.&quot; Claus Schneider suggested. The most remarkable thing about Claus was the fact that he was so unremarkable. If the dictionary were to have had a picture of an &quot;ordinary&quot; human male, Claus would have been the model. Neither particularly attractive, nor particularly ugly, Claus could blend in just about anywhere outside of Kusari. He was the same in combat. No one ever seemed to notice his presence in battle, allowing him to go about his business and destroy enemy craft with minimum fuss.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good idea.&quot; Randy said. &quot;Anything's better than wasting time in this pathetic excuse for a bar.&quot;
<br />
<br />The issue settled, the Merry Men exied the bar and headed for Biodome Beta. It was quite the contrast to the rest of the sation. Where everything else had been all metal bulkheads and machinery the biodome was full of lush, verdant plant life.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, the man you talked to, he said he'd meet you where?&quot; Georgina asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sector Four.&quot; Randy said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's head there, then.&quot; Leo said and headed off in that direction. The rest of the Merry Men followed closely behind. No one expected any funny-business but they all kept on their guard. Theirs was not a business that tolerated even the smalles mistakes. As the Merry Men approached Sector Four a general sense of unease overcame the party. Hands dropped to gunbelts and fingers twitched. When The man stepped out from behind the tree, he found himself looking down the barrels of 21 different pistols.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ha ha! Good!&quot; He said, smiling at the Merry Men. &quot;You and yours do not disappoint Mr. Sega.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Um, guys, this is the suit I told you about. I guess we shoudln't shoot him.&quot; Randy said, and motioned for his men to lower their weapons.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, indeed, Mr. Sega. That would be decidedly unpleasant for everyone.&quot; The strange man said. &quot;I am glad you came though. Now, shall we get down to business?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I thought the meeting wasn't until the day after tomorrow.&quot; Manny said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, well you're welcome to enjoy the company of Xeno's for another day and a half then, Mr. Jimenez.&quot; The suit replied. Manny made a face that clearly indicated the distastefulness of that idea.
<br />
<br />&quot;What's the deal then?&quot; Randy asked. &quot;Why'd you tell me the meeting was in two days when you're here now?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It was a test, my friend. One which, I am glad to say, you all passed with flying colors.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Is that so?&quot; Leo asked, eyebrow raised.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, Mr. Graifer. Now, would you like to know what your job is, should you choose to accept it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Shoot.&quot; The Merry Men all said at once.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, the Corsairs have recently acquired a large number of alien artifacts. This alone is not special, I know. What is special is that many of them are active. What's more, some of these active artifacts have been activating other, previously inactive artifacts. This has attracted the attention of my parent organization. You see, I work for The Order. Yes, that's right. The Order. Now, we are not the terrorists we were made out to be, oh no. Rather, we are a secret intelligence agency run by representatives of each of the four Houses. Our mandate is the protection of Sirius from a Nomad invasion. I know you have heard that we were the one's allied with the Nomads during the first crisis and that, with Liberty's victory, we were crushed but that is simply not true. We exist and are stonger than ever. It is feared, however, that these new active artifacts are harbingers of another, perhaps stonger, Nomad assault. We need to get them to Nansei Research Complex in Kyushu. We have scientists there, led by Dr. Kendra Sinclair, who will study them and hopefull unlock some of their secrets.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And you want us to take them?&quot; Randy said.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's right. At the moment most Order forces are otherwise engaged and cannot be utilised. We want you to pick up the artifacts on Freeport 9 and transtport them to Nansei. You are amongst the best couriers in Sirius and this is a project that will require the best. The Corsairs who have supplied us the artifacts have betrayed their brethren and you can expect that the Corsairs will make a concerted effort to regain their property. You may also have to deal with some Nomads. I cannot say whether they will risk being seen in open space but, if the artifacts are truly as valuable as we think it is entirely possible that they will stop at nothing to ensure The Order does not gain possession of them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Will you do us, and Sirius this service?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sounds good to me, boss.&quot; Manny chimed in.
<br />
<br />&quot;If Manny's in so am I.&quot; Leo said.
<br />
<br />Various other members of the Merry Men vocalized their support as well.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, it seems my crew like your idea, Mr. um, guy, so we'll do it. Come on, folks, let's prep for launch.&quot; Randy said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you Mr. Sega. You will receive payment upon completion of your services.&quot; His business completed, the man turned around and headed back into the forest. Moments later the Merry Men saw a fighter of unusual design rise out of the trees and shoot towards the dome. The Merry Men watched in silence as the fighter streaked towards one of the panels. Just as it looked like a collision was inevitable the panel flickered and disappeared, leaving an empty space. The Merry Men felt the wind rise as the biodome's atmosphere was sucked into the void of space but, as soon as the strange fighter had cleared thestation the &quot;window&quot; flickered back into existence. The wind subsided, leaving the Merry Men to wonder what had happened. They didn't dwell on it long though. They exited the biodome and headed towards the docking area. They had a job to do.
<br />

			<div class="content">An alarm beacon sounded
<br />
<br />&quot;Arrggh turn that off&quot; Yelled the Commodore barely heard above the noise
<br />The sound stopped
<br />&quot;Ok now what&#8217;s the problem&#8221; he inquired
<br />&quot;Sir&quot;, the sensor operator yelled&quot; Unkown jumphole rupture 20K to port&quot;
<br />&quot;Well looks like a new jump hole, put it up on the display&quot; and with that the wireframe picture of the  Leviathan  disappeared, replaced by a live action shot of a jump hole.
<br />&quot;Hmmm interesting, move us into scanning position&quot;
<br />
<br />The ship rumbled and tilted as it turned soon the front view ports showed not the mystical blue ringed sun of Tau 37 but a strange white jump hole
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, holding at 5K from jump hole&quot;
<br />&quot;Ok but all squads on alert and prep a probe we're going to see where it leads to&quot;
<br />
<br />In the fighter bay an alarm sounded and all the pilots scrambled to their standby positions. The main hatch opened launching the small bullet shaped probe into space. A few seconds later its engines ignited propelling it towards the jump hole,
<br /> A few seconds later it was gone propelled into subspace by the jump hole
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir Probe has jumped&quot;
<br />
<br />The jump whole exit spat the probe out into the brooding blue clouds and lightening storm of sigma 13.....................
<br />
<br />OOC: Ok gparent your turn

			<div class="content">OOC: Can everyone post there squadron at the top of there post, less confusing.
<br />
<br />Name: Leon &quot;Talon&quot; Rodriguez
<br />Squad: Outcast 21st &quot;Flaming Sabres&quot; (3 VHF wings)
<br />Location: Badlands, NY/Sigma 13
<br />
<br />Equipment: 6 Kraken Type 2, 1 Sunslayer Torpedo, 1 Screamer Mine, Adv Brigantine shield, Adv Thruster.
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Sabres, on me.&quot;
<br />
<br />The other 11 Sabres of the 21st Squadron formed up behind Talon as they departed Laronez base.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whats the mission, Talon?&quot; Ripper asked?
<br />&quot;Well, the Rouges found a new jump hole in the Badlands, and asked for assistance exploring it.&quot;
<br />&quot;Sounds easy.&quot;
<br />&quot;Should be.&quot;
<br />
<br />12 Sabres flew towards a couple of wings of Bloodhounds. 
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Talon, you Rouges ready?&quot;
<br />&quot;Follow us in, Sabres,&quot; replies Gunner, the Rouge leader.
<br />
<br />1 by 1, Bloodhounds and Sabres went through the Jump Hole. heading through the usual blue tunel of light, they emerged in a very blue system.
<br />
<br />&quot;Where are we, boss?&quot; asked Tracker?
<br />&quot;Hold on, my 'puters working on it..... holy @%&#163;$, we're in Sigma 13!&quot;
<br />&quot;Uh, boss, there's a Liberty Battleship (OOC: Canada) to our left!&quot;
<br />&quot;Damn Rouges! They're leaving us. We can take 'em!. Alpha and Beta wing, engage the fighters! Gamma wing, fire Sunslayers at that battleship!&quot;
<br />
<br />Alpha and Beta opened up at maximum range, ripping into the Defenders with their Kraken 2s. Gamma wing fired torpedo after torpedo into the battleship.
<br />
<br />
<br />OOC: And so we begin. Wating for the battle report, Triyun

			<div class="content">Jason launched his ship slowly turning it towards the air lock. Once he had cleared it he engaged his cruise engines.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Alpha-Bravo 99 form up on my six men&quot; Jason ordered his men
<br />
<br />3 more Eagles quickly formed up with Jason and then they turned to face the unknown planet.
<br />A couple of hours later the 4 Eagles were orbiting the planet.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir! i have picked up a jump hole on my scanner!&quot; One of the pilots said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that Delta 1, transmit the cordinates to me&quot; Jason replied
<br />
<br />Soon the jump hole was visible.
<br />
<br />&quot;My scanners is telling me that this jump hole leds to Omicron Alpha.&quot; Delta 1 said.
<br />
<br />&quot;The Corsairs will pay us huge amounts for this information!&quot; Jason said.
<br />
<br />The following day a Titan docked with Freeport 9. The pilot had got a message from a Zoner telling him to meet him on Freeport.
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you mister Jason?&quot; The Corsair asked a man sitting in the corner.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, happy to meet you.&quot; Jason replied
<br />
<br />&quot;Yea yea, why did you want me to come?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;For this....&quot; Jason said with a smile</div>

<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. Left this morning. For Freeport 2, you know. In...Bering, if I'm not mistaken. But don't even bother looking there--&quot; Finally the man looked up from the glass he was drying,&quot;Randy'll be gone within an hour or so. They're shippers, always on the move.&quot;

<br />&quot;Yeah, I kinda figured that out. Thanks for the drink.&quot;

<br />
<br />What the hell am I supposed to do now? We can't afford to wait two days! she thought to herself. I guess we're going to have to. Erich won't like it tho'.  Sighing, she walked back to the bartender and ordered a Jack Daniels.

<br />OOC: Outcast, just so you know, Bundschuh are the only faction with a constant supply of Sunslayers. Criminal factions like Outcasts and Corsairs can have them, just not a lot.

			<div class="content">The Corsair pilot stared in awe at the pad. It was a jump hole to Omicron Alpha the home of the Outcasts.
<br />They could now easily strike the home world of the Outcasts without having to go by the Sigmas.
<br />
<br />&quot;How much?&quot; The corsair pilot asked,
<br />
<br />&quot;A little figure maybe a million credits and one of your brigadine shields.&quot; Jason replied.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hmm... it could be arranged. Let me talk to the Elders about it.&quot; 
<br />
<br />A few minutes later the pilot came back.
<br />
<br />&quot;We have a deal!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Wonderful! as soon as the money has been transfered to my account i give you the cordinates to the jump hole.&quot;
<br />
<br />A couple of hours later Jason was docking with Tripoli shipyard to get his new shield.
<br />Jason was walking around exploring the station when his neural net went off.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir! Freeport 9 is under attack from the Outcasts, The Corsairs are sending ships to help us!&quot; one of his pilots reported.
<br />
<br />Jason ran to his ship witch had just been outfitted with the shields and a pair of Tizona del Cid. And quickly launched it, when he cleared the dock he set a course for the jump hole.</div>
