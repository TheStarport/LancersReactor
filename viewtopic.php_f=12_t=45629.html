			<div class="content">Well its been a while since i posted here at TLR...but hell lifes been crazy and sides that i bought my PS3 lol.
<br />
<br />Anyways on topic. I was trying to read a few reader reviews for F1 Champoinship racing on IGN and a few other sites and guess what...on a PS3 Review..Xbox360 fanboys lit up the area a plenty. Now i know its the same with Sony and Nintendo Fanboys...hense the point of the post. I am sick and tired of the media and such rousing all this hatred between people over something as silly as &quot;PS3,Wii,360 who will win the console war?!!&quot;
<br />
<br />let's face it the &quot;console war&quot; was created BY the media and not the companies. Sony and M$ have been cashing in on the game industry for YEARS. Whats really funny is noone really noticed the Sony/Nintendo joint project back i nthe early 90's. nintendo fanboys have been lighting up PS3 and 360 websites for weeks now boasting about teh high end sales...but whats funny..how long was Nintendo on the bottom? I'd say about 10 years...maybe 12. Back in the early 90's Nintendo and sony worked together to when Sega released the saturn and sega-cd and nintendo was still with the SNES. Sony was building a CD-RoM for the SNES named &quot;Nintendo Playstation&quot; (or something like that). Due to teh expencive unit sony built (far superior to the Sega CD/Saturn) Nintendo secretly contracted panasonic for a cheaper lowend model. In the end the CD SNES got scrapped because of faulty parts and so on...sony 8 months later took the tech they developed for nintendo and built the empire we know today...Playstation.
<br />
<br />M$ Watched throughout the 90's and watched gaming fall away from PC use due to upgrade cost every other month for games. The console market was decimating the PC market for gaming 3:1, so what did they do to fix teh loss of revenue? Built the platform known as Xbox. After seeing the success of the PS1 and the Current of the PS2 M$ couldn't afford NOT to get into the game race at that point. Here lies the problem...fanboyism hit an alltime high during this time. So for what i'd say 7 years now we can't get adamn decent review, post of news or any other form of info because the editors, writers and CEO's of websites like IGN,Gamespot (in particular)..etc...etc are of the generation of fanboy domination. To keep them fighting is to keep hits to the pages as well as help them bolster the company they support more (not like those places are open minded i mean c'mon)
<br />
<br />This is a post i made in a forum today and got flamed as a &quot;fanboy&quot;
<br />
<br />HOME is going to really broaden the horizons of the PS3 and allow the platform to gain the acclaim it rightfully deserves, though it will be late in the year but late is better than never. I remember telling some friends la year ago that the PS3 was going to have the same if not harsher growing pains as the PS2 did when it first came out.
<br />
<br />If anyone remembers the launch day (i got my ps2 on launch day) you brogh it home listened to that awesome &quot;whoosh&quot; noise it made and thought things were great...till you looked at the game selection...guess what you were playing MORE ps1 games at that time than PS2....i see a pattern...we are playing MORE PS2 games than PS3...go figure...More powerful and potentially groundbreaking software will come about in the next year to year and 1/2 and thats fine. The PS3 is a VERY complex piece of equipment. the Cell processer is unlike the standard CPU that PC and X360 use. What i find funny, the Xbox fanboys and the Media have YET to comprehend that the 360 was built upon existing technology of the time, yes it was far ahead of the original Xbox, still it was only a tad better than the Highest end PC and honestly today's high end PC's are far more powerful...having Quad Core Processers, the Nvidia 8800 GPU..gigs upon gigs of memory as well as terrabyte..TERRABYTE!!! disk storage. 
<br />
<br />If you look at all 3 platforms up close (excluding PC), you will defiantely notice that the PS3 in a technological standpoint is in a whole different league. The 360 is an outstanding machine do not get me wrong, but its tech is going to show age in the near future...the announcement og the 120 gig model and the add-ons for the regular 360..120gb HDD, Wireless Network adaptor,HD-DVD (since they can't use Blu-Ray)..etc...etc..they are starting to realise the error of the early release of the 360. The 120gb hdd is obvioulsy a fix for one of 2 things (though a mediocre one) And if you tally up the price of the additional hardware.. you get what the media says was &quot;far too expencive for a console&quot; the tally with all the upgrades adds up to over 700+dollars!! a tad higher than the $640 USD (with 7%sales tax) of the PS3. And as a gamer and consumer...i feel more comfortable with the product (gaming console) being intact when i buy it and not having to &quot;upgrade&quot; it. A console is there to avoid upgrades untill the next console comes out in the usual 4-7 years cycle. But after a year. If as a consumer i was aleady knowing i would have to purchase upgrade upon upgrade..i would build a highend PC and add a few parts every year. I see almost nof differance here...though it is a matter of interpretation.
<br />
<br />1. lack of blu-ray storage for games..making the end user download the content that will be on the PS3 versions of multiplatform games. The PS3 will have all the game dta stored on the BLu-Ray Disc where as the 360 using either DVD or HD-DVD only have a tiny fraction of the storage capacity. Thus causing Downloads of content that will be bundled with the PS3 version.
<br />
<br />2. Trying to dip in so to speak on the DL movie arena as well as the arcade and download game arena. And they had that market cornered for some time till the PS3 came around.
<br />
<br />Now i am in by no means a &quot;sony fanboy&quot; read my sig lol. I am a realist and also a game design major in school.(last year baby!!!) I see it how it is. Yes teh 360 has sony by the balls for now...but thats for now. And to be honest this whole damn console war is silly...the companies didn't start it..the media as well as fanboy fanaticism started the so-called &quot;Console War&quot;. Either way things are looking up for ALL of us GAMERS in the way of bigger, better, sexier and more elaborate and fulfilling titles in the years to come. Multiplatforming will also show the differance in the platforms as time goes on...and gamers are the ones who hate multiplatforming...how sad..the game company is just trying to make more cash to make better and better games..but fanboys can't see through that.
<br />
<br />I dunno i felt like ranting <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />&quot;my hopefully new sig lol&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;when will fanboys learn that their idiotic rants get noone anywhere. They say their platform is better..can you prove that it IS better and put the opposing platform company out of business by your rant? Can you say that 100% of your platforms features is perfect? Does your platform NEVER fail? Do you think game companies really care if they multiplatform and if it pisses you off and they are NOT doing it to make more money for rising design costs? If you answered yes to any of these questions you are a liar plain and simple. Get over your ego and just play

			<div class="content">I have to disagree about your take on the console war. The companies themselves have in facte created this. Just by the simple fact of being in the same competing marketplace, this will happen. Do you think M$ does not want to take marketshare away from Sony or Nintendo? Of course they do. It is very much like the fluid moving front lines of a war. They each gain and lose market share depending on what is out at that time.
<br />
<br />Yes, the media is biased as it always has been and always will be. They make there money off of advertising, so why would they want to miff there cash cows andn risk losing that money?
<br />
<br />Everyone has there opinion of what is better or what they like better. ANy time you post your opinion anywhere, you are opening yourself up for potential flaming. That is a risk which is taken by posting your opinion. Personaly, by readiny our post, I get the feeling your are a fan of Sony and the PS platform. That is just hwo your post comes off to me. I am not going to flame you for your opinion, as we all have them and are entitled to them.

			<div class="content">Something I've been wanting to say for a long time. (Of course, as with my fanfics, laziness usually gets the best of me.)
<br />
<br />After my PS2 broke down, I just moved on to PC gaming. I was tired of all these people saying that the 360 was better than the PS3 and vice versa. As you've already stated, the 360 was built on currently existing technology, and the tech in the PS3 surpasses that in the 360 by leaps and bounds. 
<br />
<br />I got my &quot;gaming computer&quot; December 18, 2005, which was only a short time after the 360 came out. That was around the time the game devolipers stopped paying attention to the PC crowd and pretty much their only focus was on the &quot;next-gen&quot; consoles. After the release of the PS3, this problem only got worse. Most recient releases I've seen that are either on the 360 or PS3 and the PC, the PC version has been of poor quality, riddled with bugs and a total lack of support. (Look at the PC version of Splinter Cell: Double Agent and you'll see what I mean.)
<br />
<br />There is one thing that game devolipers as well as those that dis us PC gamers are obviously forgetting: if it wasn't for PC gamers, there would be no &quot;next generation.&quot; If it wasn't for PC gamers, there probably wouldn't be consoles at all. Every piece of technology that a game console uses came from the PC. No PCs = no consoles.

			<div class="content">@ fadius- i agree completely about what you say in a whole about opinions. I was in a sence defending the PS platform but also trying to get people to understand that although all of a persons beloved platforms are equal in their own respects. Yes the corporations are in this for rhe money..but they have differing targets. M$ has always been a company about being &quot;ahead of the game&quot; but in doing so they lost perspective in thir customers...Hell Sony is doing the same right now. Nintendo, Sega, Atari..etc...etc are all guilty of this in one fashion or the other. But my main point was ALL platforms are good in their particular areas...X360 the online shooter realm...Sony...RPG and Racing...Nintendo Childrens/Family realm. plain and simple. Yes those 3 platforms have softaware for each of those catergories but they accel in certain areas better than others. and not 1 excels in all catergories period. (except modern PC gaming but thats obvious)
<br />
<br />@Killa- i was going to go that way...but after seeing all the issues with vista, and Valve's lack of confidance in vista (Game informer interview) one of the developers even said he would rather program for mac than deal with Vista..that really is a blow to my feelings (and thats my feelings not everyones) on whether or not to update my PC further. As of 2005-06 it was very VERY topshelf. And now is still up there...but slowly going midrange which is expected. But you are fully correct in the statement if there was no computer gaming then there wouldn't be any. 
<br />
<br />I do hate when console fanboys dis on the PC gamers...like they honestly know what they are talking about. I do however understand the disgust for pc games as of late due to compatibility issues, driver conflicts, harware issues..etc..etc that the more modern games are having. Possibly due to the overwhelming amount of difficulty in programming, environments, coding languages..etc..etc But thats the price we all pay when stepping into uncharted programming territory. I for one am not too worried about it because once arcetectures are understood more by programmers IE Cell Processors, Quad Core, DX 10...etc..etc we will not be dealing with the issues that we see now. Glitches on consoles as well as lackluster games are also a product of this same lack of understanding.
<br />
<br />a final note on multiplatforming...
<br />
<br />I do not se ethe issue from a gamer stand point (excluding the fanboy standpoint) because i understand the rise in cost of R&amp;D as well as time and man power. The idea of this multiplatform is NOT to destroy a particular platform but to get that software to all platforms to make MORE money for themselves. Granted they need to platforms to have their software for but 4 is better than 1. $50x1,000,000= 50million...$50x4,000,000= 200million....hmm the math goes for a better deal with the 200million. The developemnt cost may be 10million on a standard game...either make $40million in capitol by sticking to one platform or make 200million with all 4 and raise profits 300%. its not 3rd party loyalty anymore...its about capitol to regulate the inflating cost of development. I wish the media would put that out insted of...for example...
<br />
<br />&quot;Devil May Cry4 goes multiplatform...is this the end of sony?&quot;
<br />
<br />Nope, Capcom is just cashing in on the MARKET and not worring about platform loyalty..money speaks louder than fanboy cries and i fully support that. I forsee in the near future only 2 platforms...the PC and a Joint Console between M$, Sony and Nintendo...and any other major player...they can make FAR more revenue this way as well as the ease for the developers in game creation. But who knows maybe that dream will never happen...but who is to say they haven't already been in talks?
<br />
<br /> &quot;To live is to die....but living is to die slowly..why waste time on trivial things just play as hard as you can&quot;</div>

<br />I own a 360, a gamecube, a ps2, PSP, DS, GBA SP, and my computer is running all of my favorite games on Wista, no problem. People need to just get over it, and stop cracking Wii jokes, stop getting into fights over &quot;game supremacy&quot;, and stop shooting up with an ethernet cable. Stop complaining, go outside and play paintball if you like shooting people so much. Then when you come home with welts, we'll see whether you hang onto your vaunted elitism.

A PS3 because of Resistance: Fall Of Man and Blue Ray functionality(even though I prefer regular DVD's, it will be nice to say that I've got Blue Ray).  Each platform has it's advantages and disadvantages, to completely focus on one or the other is total arrogance and narrow minded.

			<div class="content">I've only been serous about PC gaming for a little over a year now, so I have a question.
<br />
<br />After new consoles come out, do the game companies always seem to ignore the PC crowd for a while and bring in ported games that don't run right (again, SC: Double Agent) and just don't appear to care? Is this tipical when a new generation of consoles comes out or is this a first? I remember in 2004 and most of 05 how badly I wanted a gaming computer, so I could play games like Half-Life 2, F.E.A.R. and others that seemed to completely sodomize console gaming, but then I got my rig (after a PS2 broke down and years of dealing with computers that couldn't run anything more intense than friggin Runescape) and was kind of dissapointed. Sure, Half-Life 2 was good, but then came the 360 and everyone was focusing on that. 
<br />
<br />So, is this the Dark Ages for PC gaming? Or is this just part of a cycle anytime a new generation of consoles rears its beautiful/ugly head?</div>

			<div class="content">Killa, I honestly think it's a passing thing. Advertisement is one of the key factors in how consoles became popular. PC's? I'm certain they'll be around a long time and still evolving. Look at how far they have come! 
<br />I still remember learning programming using the Z-80 microprocessor. That's sort of like an amoeba compared to today's pc's now.
<br />Console gaming has to have support for the followers to keep them &quot;hooked&quot; .
<br />Take into consideration all the games that have come and gone because of the lack of support.</div>
