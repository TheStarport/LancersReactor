			<div class="content">oh for gods sake get over yourself.
<br />
<br />There are multiple enemies in star trek because the universe is vast. But whereas star trek has humans being on earth and colonising with the expansion of the federation, stargate has ONLY humans throughout the galaxy, that or non-intelligent species that post a one-episode threat.
<br />Ok, so the goa'uld are the main threat, but the replicators are nasty bastards too right?
<br />
<br />every season of star trek has had its MAIN baddies, its just because stargate has only started its first spin-off that we're seeing a new enemy. TOS has the klingons and the romulans as the main enemies, TNG...well there was no real main enemy. just little kafuffles the try and break up the peace. DS9 has the dominion...ONLY. Voyager has the borg. Now enterprise just went to pot and there was a new enemy every series the xindi springs to mind as the only MAIN enemy earth has faced. but lets IGNORE the fact of the technology, the story system is essensialy the same and you know it. stop bringing out asthetic or universe differences. As story arcs develop theres no doubt that stargate would find its feet and develop on its own, but its still doing &quot;planet of the week&quot; stuff as its bread and butter episodes which is what star trek is all about.
<br />
<br />And lets get over this delusion that star trek and star wars are the twin pillars of sci-fi which all other shows and movies strive to be. Sure theyve been ripped off in their time but thats because theyre commercially succesfull. Since that time, Lucas has clearly shown that he hasnt got a damned CLUE why star wars was succesful in the first place, and paramount have just downed in money that they should have spent on writers so Star trek is just the laughing stock of tv sci-fi.
<br />
<br />I love galactica because there's nothing on tv like it. Its gritty, its realistic (as far as space combat against robots can be), the characters are three dimentional, they face real problems, you can connect. By the end of the episode everything is still in the terrible situation it was last time. There's political allegory in there about terrorism, about paranoia, that reflects the west's social situation believing attack could come at any time from any body. The lives of the fighter pilots are damned vital, every time a life is lost, the crew feel it. This is the last hope of humanity and their numbers are dwindling. The glossy tv shine is gone, its filmed almost like a documentary, if you ever saw Space: above and beyond, you know that its not conventional tv sci fi, and its why space... got canceled, people didnt 'get' it, as it seem you still dont. If you want your pre-packaged cliche ridden sci-fi then stargate's waiting, you could seriously do a lot worse. i personally love stargate, but im not closed minded enough to ignore what else is out there, especially since every episode of galactica has been top-notch and i can say without a doubt that there's been some seriously dicky episodes of SG1.

			<div class="content">Did i ever say i only watch stargate hella no!
<br />
<br />As for ST and SW being the main pillars of SCi-fi, Generally they are. Did i say its cus there good, regardless if they are or arent, Nope. Its becuase there big and they generaly got space Sci-fi running.
<br />
<br />When it comes to Sci-fi i like starhunter. I'm not sure if you know it or not but its gritty realistics and it really feels like space. Its not a epic adventure 24/7 and yet you can still enjoy it.
<br />
<br />Of course my stubborn Ass thought is that Dune, The book, Is one of the best ever. Now there is no doubt Galatica has good moments but i dont like the actors, nothing against them i just dont like them. 
<br />
<br />But i have a little confession to make, when i watch Sci-fi i watch it to see stunning graphics and effects and  huge space battles. When andromeda Tried to get all deep with Tyr i got fed up becuase i dont think t.v producers and script writers are deep people.
<br />
<br />I have Read very very little good Sci-fi Plot wise. I dont watch Stargate becuase Daniel understands the way of life, i watch it cus O'niel and Carter are kicking some alien ass, And i dont like things that dont like humans.
<br />
<br />You CANT have deep meaning in a hour t.v show. or a three hour movie. So i dont like it when shows try. I find Stargate avoids that alot. Galatica has brushed the line several times but thats not the reason i dont like it. I dont like galatica Becuase its not making me jump in my seat excited or make me roll on the floor laughing. Stargate does that for me....
<br />
<br />But beyond all this here is the base-line, t.v is all person to person. You proved it yourself, i hate almost all HBO series. Most people dont.
<br />
<br />Anyhow i hope i didnt make it sound like i was being very... err concerned with this. mostly i was laughing <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Well now it is 3:30 and in half a hour its Star trek TOS then Star Trek TNg then startrek voyager, then Andromeda Then stargate. So i am off <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />Edit: Not every episode of Galatica Has been top-notch, your kidding yourself <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />and tv can absolutely be deep and meaningful in 45 minutes, let alont 3 hours of movie. Its cause you smother yourself in the likes of andromeda and stargate you're missing so much. Andromeda is quite possibly, the worst sci fi ever, you might as well load up a copy of cleopatra 2525 *shudder* or that insufferable Lexx guff. Dune the book, and dune the film, are really good, i'd say lynch's movie is much more of a hallmark scifi movie than starwars. And no, i think starhunter must be a canadia thing cause i've never heard of it.
<br />
<br />Stargate has you rolling around laughing? Good lord man. And yes, i am quite dubious about your desire for great sfx and kicking of alien ass as #1 reason to watch a show. but i guess when you grow up... <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">*Pops out of shadows* I tend to agree with Arcon. &quot;SG: Atlantis&quot; has not debuted here in Aus. yet because we are just finishing off the last few episodes of Season 9 (&quot;The Reckoning&quot; was on Thursday night and was a damn fine double-episode by the way), so I cannot comment on it. Still, SG1 is generic and derivative at times, but it does not take itself too seriously and has storylines which last more than one episode. Furthermore it features character development and humour, which are seriously lacking in many science fiction series these days. For that reason, it is one of the few shows that I watch as it is far superior to 90% of the excrement that you see these days. *Especially* so-called &quot;reality&quot; television *narrows eyes*. 
<br />
<br />As for &quot;ST: Enterprise&quot; I *knew* that it wouldn't last because it was aimed to appeal to a different and &quot;hipper&quot; demographic, and was modernised too much. I watch it, but apart from one or two episodes it had been a grave disappointment. As for BSG, I am watching that too, because I feel a certain obligation as a science-fiction fan, but I have yet to be impressed. Still, the series is young. I'll give it some time to improve. Anyway, my point is that television is going to hell, there are few series worth watching these days, and SG1, despite its flaws, is one of the few good shows. Taw knows what I mean, don't you? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> *Fades back into shadows to play custom modules in NWN*

			<div class="content">Well thats what i liked about Buffy. Mainstream to hell but it was succesful for a reason. The show had oodles of humor, brilliant character development, serious issues dealt with like rape, child abuse &amp; death. The time honored &quot;monster of the week&quot; formula that smallville now runs with was perfected by it and its storylines, while lame now and then, were always of a high standard. And yeah, SG1 has that same light hearted appeal, but unlike buffy, it never strays from that, its always jovial, never have i seed a serious, emotional episode...ever.
<br />
<br />BSG is really good, but its a different kind of sci fi. its like comparing star trek to 24, they both show on tv but the format and the way its made are completely different. BSG and SG1 are scifi, but again, worlds apart.
<br />
<br />incidentally, Atlantis should ideally start after episode 2 of series 8 (esky, series 9 hasnt even started yet <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)

<br />
<br />SG1 doesnt do what alan alda turned M*A*S*H into but it does have its moments. Actualy  M*A*S*H is rather simaler in a sense,  most of the time has good humor is fun. But does have its moments..... in that sense, i would jump captain pierce started arguing with carter over gate dynamics.

<br />BSG hasnt truley impressed me either but i think it could go some where but it aint my style. They got reaaaly nice ships though...</div>

			<div class="content">The main difference between BG and Stargate is that BG actually feels real.  Its set in the future with outlandish technology, but the storylines, the characters and the sets feel real.  Stargate on the other hand is set in the present day and yet feels nothing more than cheap light entertainment.  Both shows are good in their own ways, but BG blows stargate out of the water for quality, entertainment, ships, technology, characters, actors, storylines and realism.  Comparing the two is like comparing The Magic Roundabout with Hamlet.</div>

			<div class="content">i totaly disagree,  in the later seasons of stargate it does degrade a bit as most shows generaly do.
<br />
<br />But the pilot was solid scientificly. Besides The culture work in Stargate was astounding. Both dont feel realt to me, nor should they becuase then they wouldnt be Science FICTON. 
<br />
<br />As for actors, thats unfair Richard dean anderson has and is doing a superb job and is brillant.
<br />
<br />As for the technology in both shows, i dont wanna go there. 
<br />
<br />But i can say this for both shows but mainly BG, AI is considered impossible currently. For a big reason, The frame problem. I dont feel like explaining a scientific theory on the forum but if you care you might wanna check it out.
<br />
<br />I personaly think Stargate is a better show, BG is still good and i still watch and enjoy it. 
<br />
<br />Well at least they still dont air 'V'</div>

<br />
<br />Science fiction can be very real, if you believe in the characters, the storyline and the setting.  Look at Asimov, Clarke &amp; PK Dick.  People love their work for the realism....they blend sci-fi into believable situations.  Its not about the technology, its about the characters and the settings.
<br />
<br />MacGuyver is <b>not  </b> a good actor, he's a second rate tv-only entertainer, at best. And he's the most known actor in stargate.
<br />
<br />BG on the other hand has Edward James Olmos, of &quot;Bladerunner&quot; fame, the wonderful Mary McDonnell (&quot;sneakers&quot;, &quot;dances with wolves&quot; &amp; &quot;donnie darko&quot; ) &amp; Michael Hogan of &quot;solitaire&quot; fame....not to mention the brilliant up and coming new faces of James Callis, Katee Sackhoff &amp; Jamie Bamber.  There really is no comparison in acting ability.
<br />
<br />Also, although it is based on the original TV series by Glen A Larson, the writing is mainly by Ronald D. Moore - the guy who wrote a large chunk of Star Trek TNG, Star Trek DS9 and the films &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; &amp; &quot;Mission Impossible II&quot;.
<br />
<br />If you don't like the series, then thats absolutely fair enough, but to even try to argue that the merits of Stargate exceed those of BG when it comes to acting &amp; screenplay is ridiculous.  Surely you can see that?

			<div class="content">no i cant, i watch both shows alot. I LOVE Sci-fi, it is one of my favorite things. 
<br />
<br />But Dean Anderson is a brillant actor, sure he may not be a all slots actor. But he has come a long way since mcgyver. He is able to do the action realisticly make the humor seem real, and he does seem a three dimensonal character.
<br />
<br />Amanda Tapping is also a excellent actor who couldnt of been cast better.
<br />
<br />I think both shows are truley great but i would rather Stargate, preferably seasons 1-3 please
<br />
<br />Fame doesnt prove a actor is good... look at reeves of afleck

			<div class="content">lol. affleck?!!  dogma? good will hunting? dazed and confused? mallrats? paycheck? the guy's a good actor, just because he made the likes of pearl harbour and gigli doesn't make him bad.  You're absolutely right that a good film career does not make a good actor (look at keanu right?!!)...but you can't pick on affleck's abilities because he's had a couple of flops.
<br />
<br />don't get me wrong, I think that anderson does an admirable job in stargate.  I enjoy the show.  I enjoy the cast and the banter in the script.  I enjoy most of the plotlines.
<br />
<br />but what I'm saying is that BG is on a completely different plain.  The actors I mentioned <b>are </b> quality actors, regardless of their excellent careers so far, imho they completely out class the stargate team.</div>

			<div class="content">No kidding, the lot of them kick butt. although one wonders how they did the space scenes, its like there is an actual ship out there in the midst of these massive battles with an actual TV camera.

<br />BTW: Is it just me, or does Cmd. Adama look angry almost perpetually?</div>
