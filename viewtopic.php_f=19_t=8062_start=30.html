			<div class="content">Oh my, who made this guy &quot;moderator&quot;. I've read almost every recent post in past hour in this multiplayer forum to see if I missed something in the game. I am playing with some buddies in a lan with battlecom an all. We played like 10 hours and a re already bored. Looks like there is really nothing more in this. It's really disappointing because it could have been so good. Looks like the only rescue for this can come from modders. 
<br />And stinger, in almost every thread you told people the same, you disagree, this gameis great, and sod off to X2,EVE or whatever, it looks really ridiculous. Makes one wonder if you ever saw the game? Did you ever play it?
<br />
<br />And before you post, I know I'm the noob here, I have no right to speak because its my first post, and of course, this game is so great. Yadda yadda, yadda...</div>

			<div class="content">I accually read about this game a few years back, when it was suposed to be a Massive Mult player game. Open ended universe, unrestricted traveling without the need to use jumps. factions, trading and combat put together seemed all too good to be true.
<br />When I first started trying this game out, I was amazed at the possibilities that this game seemed to have. In addition FL adds a MUCH NEEDED genre variety to the PC gaming world, as it's been nothing but 3D shooters for the pass decade . Having played the single player campaign, I though it was amazing, story was indepth, character movement was natural, decent learning curve, game play in single campaign was excellent. FL is a good single player game, and thats about it. The story although linear was good. But that's all it will be without mods, there's no replaybility without a dinamic story and multi player seems to be nothing more than single player in co-op mode without the story, experience level restrictions.  FL has some great Orginal ideas which eventually turned in to a lot of untouched potential because the devs just didn't see to it that all the potential was tapped before releasing the game. I really like the proposed idea of what this game should have been, however, even though it has come far short of the &quot;vision&quot; I still think it's worth the money as the few ideas that made it though are genuine.  The ideas in this game should be a model for the basis of all future space trade/sims. Also, If any change to FL is going to be made by M$, it must have a basis for profit (as u all know) so if anyone has any ideas, go for it....
<br />
<br />BTW, I took a look at (deleted text) seems more like the proposed idea of what FL was going to be a few years back. I hope this team will pull this off.
<br />
<br />EDIT: if u are wondering .. &quot;what ideas is he talking about?&quot; if u want to find out I susgest search for some archives in the internet. I'm sure there are still some floating around from 1999.

			<div class="content">klau1, I don't agree with your assessment of the MP portion of FL at all.  MP actually stands for Multi player and to say it's like playing single player is in my opinion the review of someone that has not pley MP with others or you'd most certainly have a different view of it.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />more words from the misinformed I fear....
<br />
<br />Apocalypse, how it is possible for a person to expound on a subject without the slightest idea of what they are talking about? Say it for what it is...assumptions and opinions. That's all they'll ever be. You're not that different, so therefore, I do not agree with your opinions either. 
<br />
<br />Come back when you can state the facts, not your interpretation of them....there's just so much you don't know about the testing process it's laughable to those that were there in the trenches. instead of jumping the gun, why not try asking first?
<br />
<br />Again, I'm not going to defend the game against the people that come on here to only bash the game. I have no concept of why someone would come into the FAN SITE and just go off bashing the theme of the very site they post their opinions too. No concept, and no patience.
<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />yadayada yada sums it quite nice up.
<br />
<br />but I am kind, I will rip your pseudo answer appart.

<br />
<br />Did those persons played the game? Or did they not?
<br />So, yeah, they did play it, so how can they have not the slightest idea what they are talking about?

<br />
<br />You somehow missed to backup your allegations. Unlike other posters, that back their points up, give their opionen, about the game, and give aswell the facts on which those opionen were based (if someone likes a game or not is always a opinion) 
<br />You&#180;re for sure free to disagree with their opinion, but you are looking stupid if you are trying that those facts which are the reason for their opionion are not there, just keep closing your eyes if thats the way the game make more fun for you, but please stfu.

<br />
<br />So, you want questions?
<br />How is it possible that a game passed beta, that needs about 5 hours to max out your charakter? How the **** is this possible? 
<br />Is the monkey planet maybe the special greeting <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />How is it possible that you can explore the whole game in about a weak easy.
<br />And how it is possible that the whole game is so ridiculous easy. 
<br />Why is tachyon posting about one day after release that he is gonna to make a huge mod with balance changes.
<br />
<br />questions over questions, and questions that won&#180;t change the fact, that the game lacks in some parts, which leads to huge imbalances in gameplay.
<br />
<br />you want to have state some facts?
<br />
<br />very easy
<br />crap ai
<br />short sp kampange
<br />no highend content
<br />no motivation to actuall do something, cause no need to do
<br />static trade system, make money making ridiculous easy
<br />and, a damn short low-end game play phase.
<br />
<br />ah but I am sure, you next will say thats just an opionen and dismiss all this, or even better, accuse me to just come here to bash freelancer, yeah that sounds even better for your next post.
<br />

<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />and did it come even for a single second in mind, that those ppl bashing fl might even be to a good deal fans? people that waited since years for freelancer, hoped, had high expectation and all they got was, well freelancer.
<br />some I guess are disappointed cause the game did not make it up to their high expectation <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />that you have no idea how this might come, and have no patience with actuall fans of space sims, well *shrugs* thats your problem, not mine, though, you will get back your peace I guess in about 2 months.
<br />than it will be dead here again like it was in the past years <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />well I hope not, but I already fear.

			<div class="content">I'll add a short comment:
<br />
<br />For some people - the game has short commings - it doesn't give enough... That the game has at LEAST 20 hours+ gaming in the SP campaign alone for lie 95% of all people is just one point... Compare that to f.x. Unreal 2!
<br />
<br />Most of us regulars have logged over 200 hours mapping out the universe... Setting up rules for us to play in our sandbox of a universe... How about racing somebody to a place? How about going one on one?
<br />
<br />There are a lot of aspects in the game to do, and not all of them are about having the meanest, baddest ship, which you can get in about 5 hours of very dedicated work, if you know EXACTLY what you are doing.
<br />
<br />But this is NOT what Freelancer is about! So calling it shortlived for the reason there aren't enough stuff for the very rich is like : DOH! You misundertood the game.
<br />
<br />We've had a a bit lot of hardcore sim'ers people posting here, complaining the game is too short...Hmm... For one 95% of them pirated the game, and thus makes them hypocrites (sp?), on the other hand they destroy the oppertunity for the rest of us to ask for an expansion to the game, because they steal the economical argument for making an expansion! So I tell you all with a warez copy: Thank you NOT for destorying PC Gaming in general and the SciFi genre more specifically! 
<br />
<br />On Stinger replying: We all are tired of people coming to a god damn fansite moaning about this and that. Sometimes this gets under the skin for all of us, and thus we try to tell you: Go bugger somebody else! I personally pay for this server, it is MY PRECIOUS! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> And it is my home - there isn't nessecearily &quot;free speech&quot; here - because it is my home! But I encourage people to behave nicely and ENJOY Freelancer. If you don't - then what the hell are you doing here? If you doo - then talk about what could be improved in a way that doesn't sound like Freelancer is the worlds biggest disappointment! It is an awesome game on it's own account - don't try to make it into something it is not!
<br />
<br />Finally - I hate discussions where people diss a person on the staff in the Forums! Please e-mail me if you disagree with a persons actions here, and I'll look at it. Especially if you drag this into the &quot; public eye&quot;, you can be darn sure I will back my staff up 100%!
