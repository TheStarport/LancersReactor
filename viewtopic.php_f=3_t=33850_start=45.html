			<div class="content">The only history I can add at this stage is some off #freelancer, the chatroom
<br />I've seen this channel since it has been started, because my dad used to be there
<br />I started chatting there the day after FL went gold, found EB and Tach there, they were very surprised to see a girl there
<br />Anyways we had tonsof fun in there, when FL finally came out, the place started getting really busy, Mad_Dog joined later on, causing lots more fun
<br />Wiz was also there from the beginning I think
<br />Then lets not forget our favourite bot, Juni, and later on Morgan our quote bot
<br />Because of circumstances we had no internet from September till March this year and when we came back #fl was basically dead now its only people looking for help who comes there.
<br />Hopefully it will be revived when Fl2 comes out</div>

			<div class="content">There are so many names not around anymore.  Mine being one, although I pop in periodically.  I had just &quot;re-signed up&quot; to help admin the site, and along comes a job which has me working about 50-60 hrs per week, and having the family.  My kids are now 11,9,and 7, and take up much of my time, the little I have.  So my &quot;I'm back&quot; thingy a month or so ago is pretty much a moot point now.  
<br />
<br />Lots of good times here for a long time.  I signed up in Aug. 2000.  For a long time I had the highest post count, then Tachyon took over and pretty much doubled my count when we were both still active members and before we became moderators.  EB had the most, by far, but moderators post numbers weren't officially counted then.  I was really involved in helping out Starlancer spoilers and people who just couldn't get passed the mission.  We had great mods for SL, but different from what we have in FL.  My favorite was flying Homer Simpson around, putting a Tachyon Cannon in his mouth and missiles coming out his derriere.  I changed the whole fleet to Homers, and the Coalition was changed to Pumpkins.  I also turned their maximum speed to 1, so they'd come in during the mission and just sit there with their engines smoking.  We had so many ship designs it was amazing.  We'd change the existing ships to other mods, and then add guns, missile mounts etc.
<br />
<br />For a long time we didn't have an off topic forum, and we had to stay &quot;on topic&quot; or we'd be locked down (which happened often).  Mostly, we had countless &quot;Moose&quot; jokes.  I once posted that I was working on a mod called &quot;dumbass edit&quot; to allow you to shoot Moose off into space.  I kept looking for the registy value for Moose and finally gave up because he had no value whatsoever! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  We got away with many Moose jokes, but they got old after a time.  
<br />
<br />The funniest thing I remember to this day is Scupmeister's signature line which was:
<br />1.  Take one alka selter and one piece of bread
<br />2.  Place alka-selter in bread
<br />3.  Feed to Seagul
<br />4.  BOOM!
<br />
<br />Gibby started to really get on our case about exploding bird joke, so anytime someone wanted to talk about birds, we'd say &quot;rear firing guns&quot; instead.  Hence my alter ego of &quot;Alka-Bird&quot; was born.  The guns thing was funny.  I remember a post about someone getting his car washed and right afterward some &quot;rear firing guns&quot; crapped on his car, and he didn't have any selter with him.   This went on for a long time.  
<br />
<br />Best memory though was getting to go to Austin, TX and meet the DA team, and spend an entire day (13 hours) touring the studio and mostly, playing the game.  At the time, I was a beta tester under NDA, but we were given the OK to discuss what we saw in Austin, so I got to mouth off about the game early.  Tachyon and EB went as well.  I feel bad for my &quot;twin bro&quot; Stinger.  He was also a beta tester under NDA, but didn't get the chance to go to Austin, so he must have gone through hell not talking about it.  This lasted about two months before they finally went gold and lifted the NDA.  I wrote a game preview for some web site, and a long travelogue here (it may even still be in the archived forums somewhere).  
<br />
<br />I became a moderator about this time.  Then we got hammered by the X-2 trolls, and it really became an issue.  Then we got all the warez's posting on the site, and it seemed that me, Stinger, EB, Tachyon, and Bargib spent all our time dealing with this.  At that time, we were the most active moderators.  The combination of my life getting much busier with family and work, and the fact that the posting and forums weren't &quot;fun&quot; anymore, is the main reason I pretty much left the site.  Gibby added more moderators, and it was really messy here.  Anytime we locked a thread, we were called Nazi's and told &quot;they don't run 'such and such' site this way&quot; and crap like that.  I spent more time moving spoilers out of the discussion forum everyday than I'd ever expect, and I had to stop because it was taking too much time from my real job.  I guess I just had to leave for a while, take a vacation from it.  I remember well when Gibby was close to closing down the site.  We emailed each other over it a couple of times, and I told him that it might be good for his state of mind to do it.  He was getting angry, other sites were incredibly nasty about him, and he has two beautiful kids to care for.  I'm glad he didn't shut down, but certainly wouldn't have blamed him if he did.  Stinger also needed to get away for some time.  We were all getting beaten up on, and it showed in our postings.  I never really came back to the forums after that.  I still checked the site out often for mods and news, but stopped posting and worrying about moderating the ever increasing forums.  
<br />
<br />So, these are just a few of my memories of my participation in this site.  I was VERY much involved when it was a Starlancer site, and stayed that way until the unfortunate situations I just mentioned.  Now, mostly it's that I simple don't have the time to do more than glance the news and download a mod now and then.  I still play the game now and then, especially if there's a really good new mod.  I've been playing the Tie Universe mod when I have time, really like that one.  
<br />
<br />It is true what they say though, you can't go home again.  My life has changed, and the site has changed, nobody's to blame, life just changes and sometimes we have to accept it and move on.

<br />
<br />@Boscoe - that was interesting reading <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I do remember the reason why i didn't join the site at first, and when i did why i stayed confined SOLEY to the general editing forum....soley due to reading a few posts that made me hate the first gaming site i visited. However, luckily times changed, and my interest in learning to mod grew - which meant i joined <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />Heck - it was only around November that i ventured out of the modding forums tbh!

			<div class="content">RUBBY!!!  Damn, it's good to see your post there!  Mr. Eagle made many of the mods for Starlancer.  Does GAG ever stop by anymore?  He also made many mods for SL.   All these names are coming back to me now.
<br />
<br />When Gibby went on vacation this place was a freekin' zoo!  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  I think we finally ended up with &quot;GOD IS ABUSING HIS AUTHORITY!!!&quot;.  I think it took Mr. Koerner about a week to get rid of all those threads.  
<br />
<br />In Starlancer, the usual top speed for ships was about 350k, so I once changed the Borg Cube to go 1,000,000k.  I kept bouncing off different planets!  I'd crank the throttle and withing about 3 seconds I was so far from the action I couldn't find it anymore.  Funny, Moose still kept saying &quot;on your six, on your six!&quot; or &quot;missile coming, hit the countermeasure!!!&quot; even though we were several parsecs away.  Never did get that &quot;dumbass edit&quot; to work.  Couldn't shut that idiot up three planets from the action.  
<br />
<br />Then there was the time we plotted to have a burning pile of dogs--- in front of Enriques's cabin and ring the doorbell and run.  Problem was, there's no dogs--- in space, so we used missiles instead!  (((((BOOM))))  And we blamed Moose for that, of course.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So many more, but gotta go.  Lot's of history in these four years here.  Much of it funny as hell.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I'm still here a few times each week, though mostly just reading news etc..
<br />GAG's still doing models for a few mods. Just stumbled over him in another forum last week <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and his talent is still amazing...(<a href='http://www.sperlingretail.com/astralprime/hornet_wallpaper_1024.jpg' Target=_Blank>one of his creations</a>)
<br />
<br />The B5 mod: yeah, we're still working on it, though i've stepped down from my position as head modeller/designer due to not enough spare time or energy to work as much on it as i'd like to. Though i just now realize how much i allready did for it, as i'm putting my models up for the other teammembers to grab.
<br />
<br />Aside from the mod, the last mod(el) i released was the <a href='http://members.chello.at/rubbereagle/viper_light2.jpg' Target=_Blank>Colonial Viper</a> from the original Battlestar Galactica last year... (though i have been working on other ships, like the cylon raider, the galactica herself, or the <a href='http://members.chello.at/rubbereagle/test_05.jpg' Target=_Blank>new Viper</a>)
<br />
<br />And other &quot;old names&quot;: Mad Dog, who was also a major contributor to the modding scene back in the SL days. He also seems to have crossed the event horizon of a black hole <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
