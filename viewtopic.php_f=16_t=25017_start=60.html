If Liberty gained control of Shiko-ku and Hamburg then they have no problem. If things go from bad to worse they can withdraw to California, Colorado and Texas, keeping New York perfectly safe and cosy warm. If things get any worse its off to Alaska with a heap of synth paste and a few boxes of Picture mags.

They not only make the mighty Titan, but they are everywherer. They slowly penetrate the border worlds, then use their resources to ditch the houses. As if they needed those resources. And then, nomads try to take them since their the only ones left, Nomads populate the barren planets, infest all the neutral innocents, and then thers on big shootoput at the end but the Corsairs take all their cannons and defeat the nomads and save the Universe!

			<div class="content">If you ask me, liberty would be the first to go: it's stuck in the classic &quot;Last Stand&quot; position, surrounded by the other hiouses on all sides. if the others decide to gang up, not even Alaska's going to tip the balance. all the enemy houses have to do is destroy the jump gate and redistribute the zone 21 mines so that any ship trying to escape alaska would be trapped and destroyed, and the libertuy forces would be quickly defeated by the lack of available resources in Alaska.
<br />
<br />Bretonia would probably be next to go, as their ships just aren't as potent as those of the other houses, and I imagine Leeds would catch fire if somebody lit a match in the wrong place, let alone if an orbital bombardment was begun.
<br />
<br />as for the others: in the storyline, Kusari was defeated at New Tokyo by the rheinlanders, but the rheinland fleet was supported by Nomad ships, tipping the balance. In a straight fight, I reckion the superior piloting skills and the terrain advantages of Kusari would win out over the bigger, slower, stronger rheinland ships.
<br />
<br />of course, then the criminals would sweep in and take out what's left. technically speaking, the only winners in a war between all the houses would be the Outcasts. with so many of the other criminal factions already growing increasingly fond of Cardamine, the outcasts would eventually gain 100% dominance over sirius thanks to their stranglehold on the Cardamine supply.
<br />
<br />from there, the average human lifespan in Sirius would increse, the fertility rate would drop, and the survivng pilots would become awesome with time and experience, so that, if the coalition ever did catch up, they'd come across a race of phenomenal, long-lived pilots. think dunedain in space.

			<div class="content">Hmm these are all very interesting stories <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />In MY opinion, Rhineland would be the first to go as they have the most problems, internally, externally. Rhineland receives attacks from the Bundschuh, Hessians, Unioners, just to name a few. These groups are pretty decent and can cause quite a lot of trouble if the colony decides to go to war. As said be4, their only remaining BS is the Westfallen in the Hamburg system. Plus their systems also look real boring. lol. One thing, the Bundschuh and Unioners mite ally with the Government in the event of a war as they wouldn't want their nation to crumble. Plus. if this follows the story line, RHineland would have access to cloak technology. ALlowing them to infiltrate enemy systems. UNLESS the (Following SP again) other colonies construct Cloak Detection Satelites.
<br />
<br />Kusari has quite a few advantages. H-Fuel production. As I recall, u need this to power ur ships. If Kusari imposed a ban on this, the other colonies would lose their BS/Cruiser/Gunboat/U name it/ capabilties. Yes u may argue Rhineland could invade the sigma systems. But I don't think the Kusari Governent/Industries or the GMG would like them there. Kusari allied with the GMG would be able to prevent that from happening. Plus that thing about the Kansai Research centre, I was reading the rumours on that base, quite a few are real interesting. One suggests the Kishiro Scientists nearly breaking the IC Jumpgate construction. ANother suggests that the Kishiro Scientists are working on a battleship with an internal jumpgate system. They were talking about creating one that could jump into Chugoku and wipe out the Blood Dragons. Pretty interesting. Also, they mentioned that the JumpGates are alien technology. Ageira must have stumbled across some alien tech and used them for jumpgates/tradelanes. And I don't think the Blood Dragons would continue harassing the Kusari GOvernment in times of war. Remember during SP Trent's log commented on the Blood Dragons still be criminals but fighting for their nation after the sigma 13 crossing when they had to fight off the rhineland fleet? The GC would also halt their attacks and would most likely combine forces too. As the GC want a Matriachy, they wouldn't want their nation to be destroyed.
<br />
<br />Liberty has the least criminal problems to worry bout. But if there were a war, the colonies would move all their BS to the jumpgates. They could block quite a few ways into their systems. And it would be quite annoying for a BS to fly  through a asteroid field. They have their BS Missouri, Yukon, Rio Grande, Mississippi, and one more I think... And the Liberty Cruisers have that really nice forward cannon <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Bretonnia has to worry bout Corsairs/Mollies. But they mite form a agreement with the Mollies, giving them the Dublin system in exchange for a joint force against the Corsair threat. Bretonnia could expand into a few of the Tau Systems too.
<br />
<br />Thinking about things, wouldn't the houses just place mine fields around jumpholes and lock down their jumpgates?
<br />
<br />Outcasts would be a threat to the houses with their ships and weapons. I recall reading a rumour of Malta having some Plutonium Tipped warheads that could &quot;Take care&quot; of any enemy fleet (or was it battleship?) in meer seconds. And they mite even invent a Planetary Cardamine Addiction Bomb!! Causing the planet's population to be addicted to tons of Cardamine!! YEEHARR!! Hmm Malta would really need to get those Warheads out for defense if that happens...
<br />
<br />Corsairs would carry out their Road to Rhineland Plan and attack Rhineland. Not very good for those Rhinelanders eh? And Corsair pilots are supposed to be highly skilled.
<br />
<br />The Nomads, well I have no idea what they mite do. 
<br />
<br />I'll like to go on but I feel I'm getting a bit too long <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Thats my 2 cents <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Heres my opinion:
<br />
<br />
<br />What would be the use of taking Liberty? Who would want to spend all the time and resources to take it when every other house can attack it? Liberty is a force to be reckoned with.
<br />
<br />As for Bretonia, they wouldn't stand a chance. As soon as Liberty/Kusari attacked Bretonia would have to shift their fleet to defend and the Corsairs would take the oppurtunity, as would the Mollys and Gaians, and they would completely tear up Bretonia in a civil war to gain it. Kusari is in the best tactical position IMO. The Blood Dragons would join Kusari, after all, what good are they if there is no Kusari left to fight for? Rhienland stands a good chance (assuming they have had time to rebuild its fleet and empire) as they have strong ships with good firepower, but the Red Hessians and other pirates are a problem.
<br />
<br />The Hispania wouldn't win. They are too thinly spread across SIrius too be a serious threat.
<br />
<br />Here's my theory of a war:
<br />
<br />Liberty takes the Independant Systems surrounding it and fortifies them and the jumpholes.
<br />
<br />Kusari attacks Bretonia and Bretonia tries to defend, and then the Corsairs, Mollys and Gaians strike out, against each other and Bretonia, sending Bretonia into chaos. At that point Liberty and Kusari both run into Bretonia and try to capture it. Not sure who would win. Probably Liberty as they have to travel less distance.
<br />
<br />Rhienland strikes out at Liberty and Kusari, who are concentrating their efforts on Bretonia. The Red Hessians and other Rheinland pirates strike behind Rhienland from behind.
<br />
<br />
<br />In short, the houses would send their entire fleets at each other and the pirates would strike from behind <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">The bounty hunters will divide up into four or five groups depending on where they operate (Rhineland,Kusari,Liberty,Bretonia, and maybe border/edge worlds) and join the house that they work in and fight along with the military in the war . Rhineland would be difficult because bounty hunters would help make up for the lack of ships and pilots comparred to other houses</div>
