			<div class="content">sw was ready to go when Wolfy pulled up in his buggy. He hopped out and went around to help her in. After she was seated, he put her case in the back and they were off for the school house. &#8220;I appreciate you help, both today and for taking me back and forth, Wolfy&#8221; She said, flashing a smile and blushing a bit too. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your more than welcome Ma...sw&#8221; Wolfy replied, catching himself. 
<br />
<br />A man with a rifle and twin pistols pulled up to the spring. No one seemed around. He dismounted and moved around to the few trees that were here. A patch of weeds and briars quickly thickened and a path was seen through them. The man moved slowly, listening for any sounds. At the edge of the briars, a man sat on a rock facing away from him. &#8220;It&#8217;s about time you showed up&#8221; the gravely voice spoke. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;It took me time to get away, the sheriff is watchful and I had to keep up appearances.&#8221; the man responded, shifting his weight.
<br />
<br />You know what you have to do, I expect you to deliver...or your family will suffer for your mistakes&#8221; the threat came back, the shadow of the seated man shifted as he looked up.	
<br />
<br />The mans fist began to clench and flex, and it was as if the seated man could see it. &#8220;Keep your temper, if you ever want to see them alive again, You have a job to do, do it.&#8221; The gravelly voice spoke, &#8220;Now get out of here&#8221;.
<br />
<br />The man moved slowly back to where he left his horse tied up. He had to come up with a plan. He could not let their plan work, but he did not want to risk his family either. He had to talk to someone, and quickly. Mounting up, pulled the reins till the horse was facing the path. He could just make out a buggy heading away from him, due south. He had an idea as to the town the rider would be heading. Now, to get things in motion before it was too late. As he turned the mount back around to ride back to Tawsburg, he saw a lone rider sitting on a ridge, It had a field glass in its hand, looking right at him. Light glint of its, his chest. The man called out, &#8220;giddiup&#8221; and the horse was off at a steady trot towards the ridge.
<br />
<br />Mustang was finishing his rounds when Bargib rode up. &#8220;Stinger should be back in an hour or so&#8221; Bargib stated. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;You think its true then?&#8221; Mustang returned. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I really hope I&#8217;m wrong, but my source is reliable, but damn it, a spy in the Marshals service, and him to boot, I don&#8217;t want to believe it, but till I get proof other wise, yes, we keep an eye on him&#8221; bargib spoke, trailing off at the end. He pulled the reins around and headed to his house.	
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn it to hell&#8221; Mustang said, to no one in particular. Frustration was deep in his voice. He had come to trust the man and now this? They only had four more days till the train would be here, and they only had half the men they needed. 
<br />
<br />The Forum was full tilt today. Talk was all over about an important visitor coming. No name was mentioned, but it was enough to get Bargib and the deputies on the band wagon and bring in US Marshals. Esq was sitting near the door to catch folks coming in. He wanted to know what was going on. It had him a little on edge not knowing. He had even tried Taw to get information, but Taw knew nothing and could not get to his sources. Chips walked in, breaking Esq&#8217;s thoughts. He sat down at the table without even asking. Esq looked at him expectantly. &#8220;Esq, we need to have a talk&#8221; Chips stated and got up. Esq grabbed his hat ad followed him to the back room.
<br />
<br />Sw sat at her mirror, slowly combing her hair. She had something on her mind. Indy had stopped by earlier and asked if she would be interested in having some of her stories published in the paper. Naturally, she was flattered. She replied that she would have to think about it, but would get back to him by morning. He left shortly after that. She thought about it, but another face interrupted her thoughts...Wolfy. He was a friend , but she, did not know if there was more of interest than that. She was near twenty seven, an old maid by current standards, but she would not be rushed. She knew the right man would sweep her off her feet one day. She even had the early workings of a story on it. She stopped in mid stoke, looking at the reflection of herself in the mirror. Wondering what the future held for her....
<br />
<br />Locutus rode to the stables and dismounted as Bargib came out of the stalls. Stinger was about five paces behind Locutus. He stayed on his horse as he had rounds in a half an hour. &#8220;We need to talk, now!&#8221; Bargib spoke, his voice a little taunt. Locutus nodded. He knew Bargib and he needed someone to trust. This would now make or brake him. They headed back into the barn stall. 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, in Washington, &#8220;Mr President, a moment of your time&#8221; A man ran up. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is it Wayne, I don&#8217;t have a lot of time&#8221; The President replied. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your trip to the west coast leaves the station in one hour, Sir&#8221; The aide replied.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, I know, the Vice president can handle things here while I&#8217;m away&#8221; President Pierce answered and turned to leave. . His aide was getting on his nerves with his incessant worrying. He knew the risks and had planed to meet them head on. The men would be in position all along the rout and the soldiers would be on the train as well.

			<div class="content">&#8220;Yes, I know, the Vice president can handle things here while I&#8217;m away&#8221; President Pierce answered and turned to leave. His aide was getting on his nerves with his incessant worrying. He knew the risks and had planed to meet them head on. The men would be in position all along the route and the soldiers would be on the train as well. 
<br />
<br />An hour latter, Bargib just hung his head. He wanted to think it was all just a dream. What Locutus had just told him was not a dream, it was a nightmare. The plot was monstrous in size and those involved, powerful. It would take calling in a lot of favors on this one to get themselves through it. If they could not come up with a plan to deal with this, he would be obligated to telegraph Washington, and tell them to cancel the trip, that the Presidents safety had been compromised. Bargib knew of some &#8216;people&#8217; that he could wire to help rescue Locutus&#8217;s family, but only if there was enough time.
<br />
<br />The Train was eight cars long, with two flat beds with two cannons apiece. The solders were in the second and last cars. The president would be in the center car with his staff in the other car. There were ten Marshals on board and would be added to if necessary. The engine was the newest and fasted around. The wood car could carry coal, but as that would be scarce, they would use cord wood. It held a large supply to reduce the need to stop other than for water.  
<br />
<br />The telegraph office had seen more work in the last five days than in the last two years. Now, Stormtrooper was sending a message to Dodge to the sheriff there. He saw what was written, there was no way to avoid it. Within an hour, there was a reply and Locutus read it and shoved it into his pocket and walked off. Stormtrooper just stared after him, shaking his head. To lose you family has to be hard. The reply message had read, The sheriff has look into the matter but regrets to inform you, that the people in question were found dead in their house. All had been shot to death. Stop. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Locutus&#8221; Bargib called out, &#8220;Stop.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Locutus turned, tears in his eyes and anger in his face. &#8220;This will be payed for, I guarantee you that Bargib.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;The best way you can get back at them is to tell me everything&#8221;Bargib said, &#8220;That way we can prevent this attack from happening.&#8221; he continued, &#8220; I&#8217;m sorry about you wife and daughters, I really am, but don&#8217;t let it stop you from doing what&#8217;s right...I know your hurting.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Morning came with sw making up her mind. She would share her stories with Indy to publish. Wolfy was out front with her buggy this time. She flashed a smile, &#8220;It&#8217;s fixed&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I just need you to drop me off at the mill and you can head where you need to&#8221;. Wolfy said, his voice hinting at disappointment.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You got it, but won&#8217;t you need a way home tonight&#8221; she asked, a hint of mischief on her face. 
<br />
<br />Indy had the general layout of the next addition set. He wanted to add the news that was about to happen, but knew he would endanger people if he did. He had always practiced responsible journalism and wasn&#8217;t about to change now, even if it meant the story had to be delayed. He would after all, have the whole story ahead of time, and could then break it to other papers. He put the information he had gathered into his safe and locked it. 
<br />
<br />Morning had also brought mor men. The count was now about forty five, all sworn in as US Marshals. Most were either deputies or sheriffs else where. Some were former Army officers as well. They would be able to help with tactics and would follow orders without question. 
<br />
<br />Bargib was in the jail explaining the whole situation to Mustang, Stinger, Chips, Boscoe while Locutus paced behind him. Stun looks were all around, but also looks of compassion towards Locutus. Wizard walked in at that moment, &#8220;Sorry I&#8217;m late, Stormtrooper flagged me down and wanted to get you this&#8221;. It was a folded piece of paper.
<br />
<br />Bargib read it, looked up with surprise on his face, and turned to face Locutus. &#8220;You better read this&#8221;.
<br />
<br />The train was moving past the first stop. The transfer of water and a little wood went well. No one in the small town knew what was on the train. Many had seen the cannons and soldiers and just figured an army movement. That happened from time to time as they headed to different forts. So no one paid any attention to this one. 
<br />
<br />Inside, however, &#8220;Mr. President, we have passed th first leg with no problems, Sir&#8221; the aide said.
<br />
<br />President Pierce looked at the aide, &#8220;That remains to be seen, we have a long way to go.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The president went back tot he book he was reading even as the train began a slow climb over part of the Appalachian mountain area. The trees were beautiful, the streams they passed, breathtaking. 
<br />
