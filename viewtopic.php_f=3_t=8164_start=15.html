			<div class="content">I think the major reason we see people writing negative things about FL is that it's easy to get the picture that FL is similar to Elite/Frontier by reading the official web site etc. This since they use terms and descriptions that match those games fairly well. It's not exactly being advertised as an adventure shoot-em up IMHO.
<br />
<br />And, if you expect something in the lines of Frontier, you might get a bit disappointed by the limited scope of FL.
<br />
<br />Personally I was completely hooked by FL while I played the storyline missions, and even while I tried to get the max level and best equipment after that. Then the scope of the game became clear to me and I'll admit I was a bit disappointed.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I wasn't disappointed in the game itself, but simply because FL pretty much was over for me and it had been a fun game while it lasted.</div>

			<div class="content"><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Regarding the non-moving market prices, why is this such an issue? So, everyone knows the best routes and how to make the most money by trading, what's the big deal? Do you honestly think that making prices swing by +/-10% that it would make that much of a difference? Would buying or selling at 10-20% difference make or break this game? Give me a freakin break! The same people would still be making the same runs regardless if they make 10% less or not. &quot;Man, This game rocks because I only made 720k in profit instead of the hard coded 800k!&quot; How ludicrous is that? Even if it was put into the game, how much of an impact do you think it would have on the end-game? Would it make it more fun because it took an extra 15 minutes to make the same money you would have anyway?  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Well, to put it this way - it would be great fun if with the market shifts the rest of the gameworld followed. For example:
<br />
<br />If there is extra production in one system/planet of a certain product. It means you can get it much cheaper there, the traderoute is then established for all traders. This in turn attracts pirate activity. Increased pirate activity would attract more bounty hunters and police (and thus leaving other routes unguarded for other types of trade - cardamine running anyone?). If production levels of the aforementioned product reach a certain level and are starting to fail the demand for this product or if the buyers' needs are satisfied from this product then the traderoutes shift, piracy shifts, bounty hunting/policing shifts. And no, I'm not talking about JUST the 100-250 odd units of some product the player might move at some point, but the total of cargo hauled by all other freighters that take advantage of this traderoute.
<br />
<br />Ofcourse all of the above would also affect the politics of factions/corporations as some would be weakened and some would be strengthened by time, etc. It would also influence their balance of power in the systems and in turn in the whole Sirius sector. <b>That  </b> is the whole point people that fussed about dynamic economy meant to make. And that's all the fun in it, trying to find your niche in the ever evolving economy - not just &quot;if i do this run 10 times i'm the richest bastard around&quot; but also having some cunning in discerning possible market flunctuations. 
<br />
<br />However, since it's not in the game and there is no prospect of it being in the game at a later time, it's pretty pointless to nag about it - there are many other things you can do, as you've mentioned. And there are tons of ways to enjoy a game.

			<div class="content">Cool ideas, Stone-D.  While I'm not opposed to new ideas or implementations to the game, I just think that not having them at release doesn't detract from what I'm looking to get from the game.
<br />
<br />I didn't intend for my post to become a debate on the merits of a free economy but, since we seem to be having a mature conversation about it, allow me to put forth a few tidbits.
<br />
<br />Realistically, I don't think it's feasible for one person to affect a planetary economy by disrupting a trade lane, but I don't want to go into how &quot;real&quot; a sci-fi computer game is or isn't. However, let's say we wanted to make a pseudo-realistic economy in FL, first of all you would have to make each commodity on each station limited in number.  The majority of commodities would have to be finite in number to realistically model the concept of supply. As an example, say you wanted to fill your trader with diamonds, would you expect them to have 75 units (tons?) of product every time you went there?  There would probably be certain commodities that were infinite in quantity based upon where you purchased them, such as water on an ocean world. Then, to finish off the supply side, you would have to create trade lanes/ routes for every commodity that each station and planet had in stock. This would create the supply of a commodity to a planet. If the shipment didn't make it for some reason, there wouldn't be a re-supply of the commodity at that particular place. Back to our example of the Diamond trader, since he purchased all of the stock a few days ago, there are no more diamonds to be had for trade, at least in this station until the next shipment comes in.  If that shipment is hijacked, then diamonds wouldn't get re-supplied until possibly the next shipment.  Once again, this is only workable if you make the commodities finite in quantity.  It wouldn't work with the bottomless glass of supply that's in FL now.
<br />
<br />Prices could then fluctuate based upon supply and demand, although it's still way too shallow and simplified for my tastes.  If there is a shortfall of product, basically, prices will go up for every entity in the supply chain, from manufacturer, to wholesaler or distributor, to reseller then to the consumer.  So, If diamonds were hard to come buy, the original station the product is made, along with the every other station that needs them will probably go up in price.  The longer you want, but can't get a commodity, the more the price will go up.  Once again, this price will go up pretty much everywhere.  
<br />
<br />Let's switch to real world for a minute while we talk about demand and pricing fluctuations.
<br />
<br />Pricing would stay inflated and unstable until supply catches up. Also, people tend to panic when they can't get something they need or want, and think that by requesting more than they really need, they'll get at least what they originally want. Typically, what happens is manufacturers see that there's a significant shortage of their product and a very high demand, so they ramp up production to capture all the profits that are to be had.  As they start fulfilling their customer's orders, which are inflated, pricing starts to stabilize as supply starts meeting demand.  Customers begin realizing that they need to start canceling those inflated orders that they put on the manufacturer.  As these orders are cancelled, the manufacturers now have too much product, and they drop prices further in order to move it.  Just as pricing went up all along the line of supply, prices will now go down because of the perceived glut.  Soon, pricing will be only slightly above costs and profit margins will be much lower than they were in the shortage, until the whole thing runs its course again. I'm keeping this simple and not getting into multiple manufacturers or multiple lines of supply. The last thing I will mention about this is that these market shifts, such as allocations and gluts, usually span several years and are cyclical.
<br />
<br />Now, could this or should this be applied to FL? Well, if you want it realistic, and your supply affected by pirates and or the player, then you could do so, as long as commodities are not in infinite supply. However, prices shouldn't be going up or down instantly based upon one or two shipments.
<br />
<br />To me, all of this is way too complicated for a sci-fi space game.  Maybe it's best to have the economy dumbed down to have a +/-10% random fluctuation, but then we get back to a point in my original post, will it really add so much more play time and depth?
<br />
<br />One last thing before I wrap this pile of crap essay up.  I do think it would be cool to have planetary emergencies or delivery missions, but not having them won't make me hate or dislike this game.</div>

			<div class="content">wow this is really good thought out stuff <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> To me a better trade system would improve the game a lot, and the idea's proposed in this thread would really make trade a bigger aspect of the game. only this: a logically working trade system would have soo much more variables (customer demand, shipments, type of planet, etc etc) thats its going to be very hard to realize. So i have to agree on debris its going to be way to complicated, and a random fluctuating system would have to do (for now <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)

<br />
<br />Well, in the long run it would also affect what kind of equipment you can get for your ship - as there has to be a factory that actually produces them and it has needs as well. Also it would make the prices for said equipment vary from system to system. I think it would make a much more diverse and unique experience for each player - it's not really THAT complicated - as you have &quot;best sell&quot; and &quot;best buy&quot; shown to you for this static economy, same thing could be applied for the dynamic economy for the lazy ones that don't want to think much about it. So in essense it wouldn't hinder the easy-going gameplay and it would also add greatly to the game (thus doing away with all the nagging too.. hmm! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).

<br />Well, you already have the population of planets/bases and their &quot;purpose&quot; (some are shipyards, other are military installations, etc) so from there you can calculate their consumption rates of various commodities (some are <i>actual needs </i> for their production and some others are just consumables [everyday luxuries of sorts). The data structure isn't all that hard to conceive/implement and it's not that intensive as a calculation either - no one said it had to be truly realtime either, the economy loop could work asynchronously to the main game loop or even on an entirely separate thread.</div>
