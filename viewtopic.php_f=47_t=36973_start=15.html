			<div class="content">Ok here is the next chapter:
<br />
<br />Chapter 3: A Dangerous Discovery
<br />
<br />Hellblade Squadron and their Outcast guide wing launched off of Planet Malta and headed to the Tau-37 jump hole.  They passed through that system without any trouble and arrived in Tau-23.  As they passed they got some ships on their scanners.
<br />
<br />&quot;Seth, do you recognize those scans?&quot; Matthew said.
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to get a little closer until I can identify them..........oh no!&quot; Seth yelled.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who is it, more Nomads?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, there are no Nomads in this system, it's a Kusari patrol.  But the ships are much better than I have ever seen before.  They are even more powerful than the Titans and Sabres we have.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;How many are there?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Only about 2 wings.  I think we can take them.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, all wings, break off and attack!&quot;
<br />
<br />Hellblade Squadron broke off and attacked the Kusari wings.  The shots flew out and slammed right into the Kusari fighters, breaking some of their shields.  Several shots hit the hulls of a few ships, but they didn't do much.
<br />
<br />&quot;They must be Very Heavy Fighters, there hulls are strong.&quot; Matthew said.
<br />
<br />Suddently, the Kusari ships swearved, zipping around at lighting fast speeds.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh my God, those things are fast!&quot; Seth yelled.
<br />
<br />&quot;How can those ships move that fast and still have more armor than a Titan?&quot; Matthew said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know, but we need to fight!&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />After a heated battle, the Kusari wings finally fell.  However, 3 wings of Titans were lost.
<br />
<br />&quot;God those ships were powerful!&quot; Matthew said. &quot;They took out most of my squadron!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We must continue to the coordinates.  We better hope we don't run into anymore Kusari fighters on our way there.&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Affirmitave.  Let's continue onto Tau-31.&quot;
<br />
<br />They passed through the rest of the Taus easily and arrived in Tau-31.  They began flying to the coordinates.  When they got within 20 k to the coordinates, strange scans appeared on the long range scanners.
<br />
<br />&quot;There is something coming up.  Best be careful.&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />They finally got to the coordinates and there was a terrifing sight.  At the coordinates was a giant shipyard.  But that was nothing compared to what was guadring the shipyard.  A dozen heavy battleships where surronding the shipyard, along with dozens of cruisers, about 50 gunboats, and about a hundred fighters.  They fighters were all Very Heavy Fighters, appearently the new House ones.  They were models from various houses, including the Kusari ones Hellblade hade fought earlier.  All the rest of the models looked just as havily armored and just as agile as the Kusari ones.  When Hellblade scanned the capital ships, they had shields!
<br />
<br />&quot;Dear God!&quot; Matthew yelled through his comlink.
<br />
<br />How was this chapter?</div>

<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 4: A Gruesome Event </b>
<br />
<br />The battleships loomed in the distance, along with all of their escorts and other ships.  They hadn't seemed to have noticed Matthew, Seth, and the rest of Hellblade.
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's get out of here.  We need to inform Hispania of this.&quot;  Matthew said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I cannot believe that the Houses have built this.  In OUR system!&quot;  Seth yelled angrily.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok everyone, we will set a course for Kayno Base.  It is the only base in this system I believe.  Seth, you know where it is, you lead the way.&quot;  Matthew said.
<br />
<br />So, the Titan and Sabre wings, the only ships left in Hellblade Squadron, flew away from the battleships to Kayno.  They all landed on the base and relaxed until their ships were repaired.  Matthew, Seth, and Rick were in the bar, talking about what had happened.
<br />
<br />&quot;I can not believe the power and speed of those new House Very Heavy Fighters.  They are better than anything Hispania has!&quot; Rick said.
<br />
<br />&quot;And those battleships are amazing!  How could they have come up with this without our spies knowing?&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know but -&quot; Matthew was cut off by a rumbling in the base &quot;What the heck is going on!?&quot; he yelled.
<br />
<br />&quot;Attention!  Attention!  The base is under attack *crackle* by a House fleet!  Everyone *crackle* evacuate the base NOW!&quot;  the loudspeaker yelled.
<br />
<br />It must be that House fleet we saw earlier!  We gotta get outta here!&quot;  Seth yelled.
<br />
<br />&quot;Agreed.  Come on Matt, let's go!&quot;  Rick yelled.
<br />
<br />Rick, Seth, and Matthew ran down the docking bay.  It was complete chaos!  Everyone was running to get into their ships and get out of the base.  Rick, Seth, and Matthew got into their ships and quickly lifted off.  Once they got out, they saw the House fleet, dozen battleships and all.  They were all attacking the base with their full power.
<br />
<br />&quot;Rick, Matthew, we have to go!  I am sure the rest of our wings will follow.&quot;  Seth said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, let's go. Where to Seth?&quot;  Rick said.
<br />
<br />&quot;We got to get to Planet Malta.  They gotta be warned of this!&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />The three ships entered formation and flew off.  Once the were about 10k away from Kayno they heard a deafining explosion.  Kayno base had been destroyed.  They turned around and saw their House fleet destroying what was left of the base and the remaining ships.
<br />
<br />&quot;NO!  They destroyed all that was left of my Squadron!  THEY WILL PAY!&quot; Matthew yelled.
<br />
<br />&quot;They will pay but he gotta get to Malta.  They have to be warned!&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok.  Let's go.&quot; Matthew said.
<br />
<br />And the three ships flew away from the horrible battlefield and toward Omicron Gamma and Planet Malta.

<br />
<br />You did ask for some comments so I'll make a couple, if that's ok.
<br />
<br />So far, the story has been extremely descriptive of exciting battle scenes. As a reader, I'd like to learn more about your central character(s) and thus, maintain an interest in how he/she/they interact with your story/world <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Good stuff so far !

			<div class="content">Thanks for the suggestion Athena, I tried to incorperate it into this chapter.  Hopefully I will give everyone a little better of a feel for the character's personalities.
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 5: A Third Power </b>
<br />
<br />Seth, Rick and Matthew sped through the Taus at an amazing speed.  No hostiles came to interupt them, most likely due to the fact that they were all at what was once Kayno.  Finally, the 3 friends jumped into Omicron Alpha and made their way to Planet Malta.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank God we finally made it back.  It's good to be back home.&quot;  Seth said.
<br />
<br />&quot;But we better be on the lookout for Nomads.  I don't want to fight them again and they could be anywhere.&quot; Rick said nerviously.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah.  Even one Nomad super fighter could take us all down.  Best keep your guard up.&quot;  Matthew replied.
<br />
<br />Luckily, they did not come under any attack by Nomads or any other hostiles and safely landed on Malta.  Once their ships were safely in the docking bay, they rushed to the head government building.  They walked in and requested a meeting with the Supreme Commander of the Outcasts.  After waiting for a while Seth and Matthew proceded into the Supreme Commander's meeting room while Rick went to the bar to check the latest news.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, you must be Seth, leader of our own Bloodsword Squadron.  And Matthew, leader of the Corsair Hellblade Squadron.  Good to meet you.&quot; said the Supreme Commander, holding out his hand to them to shake.
<br />
<br />Seth and Matthew shook his hand and greeted him as well, and then the meeting began.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, we have a big problem.&quot; Seth said.
<br />
<br />&quot;As you may know, my squadron was sent to Tau-31 to look for a rumored House shipyard in the area.  Seth and his wing served us as guides through the Taus.  We found the shipyard, but what was around it was even worse.&quot;  Matthew explained.
<br />
<br />&quot;Around the base were a dozen heavy battleships with shields, two dozen cruisers, around fifty gunboats, and over a hundred of the new House Very Heavy Fighters.  Those fighters are stronger and faster than Hipania's Titans and Sabres combined.  That fleet must be destroyed at all costs.  So far it has uterly destroyed Kayno Base in Tau-31, along with almost everyone in it.  Our of our whole search party, only Matthew, Matthew's friend Rick, and myself remain.&quot;  Seth said.
<br />
<br />The Supreme Commander blinked a few times in suprise, extremely startled by the news.
<br />
<br />&quot;I am very sorry to hear this.  I will send this message to the Corsair and Red Hessian leaders immediately.  This is terrible news.&quot;  The Supreme Commander said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you for your time sir.&quot;  Matthew said.
<br />
<br />Matthew and Seth walked to the bar to find out if Rick had found anything out.  When they walked into the bar, Rick ran up to them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Matthew, Seth, quick, look at the news!  There is something you should see...&quot;  Seth said, flustered.
<br />
<br />The three of them turned to the screen and on it flashed a big battlefield that looked like it was in New York.  Then the newcaster began his report.
<br />
<br />&quot;Due to the Houses new law that every man fit to fight must quit their former jobs and join their navies, the corperations have formed a giant alliance between all corperations except the Zoners called the Corperate Federation, and have been secretly training pilots and building advanced ships and guns for years.  The Federation has declared war on the Houses and the Hispanic Alliance and it's armada has already destroyed a House fleet in New York and a Alliance fleet in Omega-3.  It looks like this is a three way war now between the Houses, Alliance, and Federation in a winner-take-all fight to the death.  This has been Hispania News.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You have GOT to be kidding me!&quot;  Seth and Matthew said simultaneously.
<br />
<br />So, was that chapter ok?  And yes, before anyone askes, I did get the idea of the Corperate Federation from CYOF.  As usual, all comments and suggestions are welcome.

<br />Let the Nomads and a other race (Dom Kavash) wage war against each other. The other race helps the Corperate Federation, and the Nomads help the Pirates and the Houses. Like in Babylon 5 the Vorlons and the Shadows who wage war against each other (and influence other races to help them fight against the other).

<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 6: A New Ally </b>
<br />
<br />&quot;Battles have been increasing every day.  Every day the three sides of this war lose more and more pilots.  Sirius is on the brink of chaos.  Each side is racing to build more ships, get more recruits, and build more weapons.  This is the biggest war in the history of the human race.  Not even the World Wars of Old Earth of even the final battle for Sol between the Alliance and Coalition can match the devestation and destruction this war has created.  In the end, one side will prevail while the others will perish.  This is truly the time of reckoning.&quot;  the newscaster said, exactly two weeks after the formation of the Corperate Federation and the real start of the Black War.
<br />
<br />Seth, Rick and Matthew have done a lot since the start of the Black War.  The have been on dozens of mission against the Houses and the Federation alike.  They had each been given their own squadron to defend Hispania and attack the House and Federation forces.  For Matthew, the Corsairs resupplied and rearmed his Hellblade Squadron, and it was returned to it's former glory.  Seth, as Bloodsword Squadron was given a new leader, got a new Outcast Sabre squadron named Meteor Squadron.  Rick decided to travel to Ronneburg and team up with the Red Hessians.  He quickly became a well-known and well-liked member with them and was even given his own squadron, Pheonix Squadron.  All three sqaudrons fought in many missions, most of them against Rhineland.  Strangely, the only forces they hadn't had a mission against yet was Kusari.  One day, all three squadrons recieved news from Mission Command on their orders.
<br />
<br />&quot;Greetings Hellblade, Meteor and Pheonix Squadrons.  We have a mission for all three of you.  A Rhineland fleet has been detected in Dresden.  There appears to be about fourty Rhineland very heavy fighters and one or two battleships, so we will need all three of you on this one.  Is this acceptable?&quot;  Mission Command said.
<br />
<br />All three of them accepted the mission and asked when they should leave.
<br />
<br />&quot;As soon as possible.  The fleet must be terminated before it can get to one of our bases.  Good luck to you.&quot;  Mission Command said, then terminated the transmission.
<br />
<br />All three squadrons quickly got ready and launched off.  They all meet in Dresden.
<br />
<br />&quot;Long time no see Matt, Seth.  Good to be working with you again.&quot;  Rick said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Same here.&quot;  said Seth.  &quot;Lets go kick some Rhineland butt!&quot;
<br />
<br />The three squadrons sped toward the coordinates.  Once the got within about 3K, they cut their cruise engines and activated their weapon systems.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok everyone get ready!  This could get rough!&quot;  Matthew instructed.
<br />
<br />They continued on to the coordinates, but when they arrived there was no one there.
<br />
<br />&quot;Where the heck are they?&quot;  Seth said angrily.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh, Seth,&quot;  Rick said, terrified, &quot;look behind you!&quot;
<br />
<br />Behind them was about eighty Rhineland very heavy fighters, six heavily armed and shielded battleships, and at least twenty gunboats.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh God no.&quot;  Matthew said, stunned.
<br />
<br />Then the Rhineland fleet opened fire on the three Alliance squadrons.  Hispanic fighters were going down like flies.  By the time that the three squadron had lost about half of their forces, something else appared on radar.
<br />
<br />&quot;Something is coming up on radar.  What the heck is it?&quot;  Seth yelled.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh no it's a Kusari fleet!  Were doomed!&quot;  Rick screamed.
<br />
<br />The Kusari fleet closed in on the battlefield.  They had a force about as strong as the Rhineland one.  The Hispanics fought desperaely, knowign that once the Kusari fleet was in firing range they were goners.  The Kusari fleet was now right behind the Rhineland fleet, almost in firing range.  Suddenly, they stopped and opened fire ont he Rhinelanders!  Half the Rhineland flett went down in the suprise attack.  Then Matthew got a message from the Kusari fleet commander.
<br />
<br />&quot;Commander Dakkar, this is Commander Ikko Zatashi of the 23rd Kusari strike fleet.  We have come to assist you against the Rhinelanders.&quot;  Commander Ikko said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Affirmative Commander Zatashi, let's take these Rhinelanders down!&quot;  Matthew said.
<br />
<br />The Hispanic and Kusari forces attacked what remained of the Rhineland fleet relentlessly, and now it was the Rhineland forces turn to fall like flies.  After twenty minutes of heated battle it was all over.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you for your assistance General Zatashi, but why did you help us?&quot;  Matthew said.
<br />
<br />&quot;You have not heard the news?  Kusari has rebeled from the rest of the Houses and joined Hispania.  This is only one of the many suprise attacks we are conducting against the rest of the Houses.  We are also bringing our technologies to Hispania, like our very heavy fighters and our capital ship shields.  With our help Hispania will win this war!&quot;  General Zatashi said enthusiastically.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hispania will rule!&quot;  Seth, Matthew and Rick all shouted.
<br />
<br />So tell me what you think.  Sorry it took so long to finish this chapter.</div>

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 7 - A Dangerous Plan </b>
<br />
<br />&quot;Kusari's suprise turning to the Hispanic side and it's suprise attacks have the Houses rattled.  About one fourth of the House fleet has been reported to have been taken out because of these suprise attacks.  The Corperate Federation has taken advantage of this, attacking the House fleets as they will encounter less resistance.  Also, Kusari has already taken back the Taus for Hispania and is sharing it's technology with the other Hispanic factions.  Already the Titan Mk II and the Sabre Mk II are being created.  Hispania has gone from the underdog to the expected winner of this war.&quot;  the news exclaimed a week after Kusari's turning.
<br />
<br />Seth, Rick and Matthew, along with General Ikko, have merged their forces to create a new fleet for Hispania, Katana Fleet.  Katana consisted of eight heavy battleships of Kusari design, twenty gunboats made by Hispania, and about one hundred very heavy fighters of different designs.  Katana had taken down quite a few House ships in Dresden and the Omegas so far.  They were relaxing in their new headquarters on Planet Honshu when they got their next orders.
<br />
<br />&quot;Katana Fleet, good to see you.  We have a mission for you if you're interested.  We won't order you to go on this one as it may be extremely dangerous.&quot;  Mission Command said.
<br />
<br />Let us hear the mission, then we shall make our decision.&quot;  Ikko said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we believe that the one House that is the hardest to attack is also the biggest problem.  House Liberty seems to be the main leader of the Houses and we believe that if we weaken them our victory will come easier and quicker.  So your mission is to go to Colorado and destroy their forces there.  We do not know exactly how strong their forces are in Colorado, so you may need some support.  Luckily, we have found a force that knows Liberty well and can attack them easily.&quot; Mission Command explained.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who's that?&quot;  Rick inquired.
<br />
<br />&quot;The Liberty Rogues.&quot;  Mission Command answered.
<br />
<br />&quot;What!  The Rogues!  They are just a disorganized lot of petty criminals who have almost no pilot skill!  They have no hope against Liberty and their help would not change anything!  They are just pawns, the Outcasts controlled them like puppets!&quot;  Seth said angrily.
<br />
<br />&quot;The Rogues are not what they used to be, Commander Seth.  They are now much more organized and highly dangerous.  They have taken over the other Liberty criminals, the Lane Hackers and the Xenos, and are now a major threat in Liberty and the Independent systems.  They even have some stolen Liberty very heavy fighters.  The Rogues have come a long way from their petty criminal days.&quot;  Mission Command said.
<br />
<br />&quot;So I take it we will be teaming up with these Rogues?&quot;  Rick asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.  You will be meeting a squadron of theirs at their Gailileo base of Padua.  They will guide you to Colorado and assist you in destroying the fleet there.  Is this acceptable?&quot; Mission Command said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes it is.  Katana Fleet is prepared to fight.&quot;  Matthew said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Very good.  Good luck.&quot; Mission Command said, turning off the communicator.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok Katana, let's move!&quot; Matthew yelled.
<br />
<br />Katana Fleet launched off of Planet Honshu and flew towards the recently constructed Shikoku jump gate.  They then took a jump gate to Gailileo and flew to Padua.  Once they arrived they saw a squadron of Rogues in stolen Liberty Defender Mk II's.
<br />
<br />&quot;Greetings, Katana Fleet.  I am Commander Ryone of the Liberty Rogues Shadow Squadron.  We will accompany you to Colorado.  Follow us to the jump hole.&quot; Commander Ryone said.
<br />
<br />&quot;So how big is this fleet in Colorado anyway?&quot; Rick questioned.
<br />
<br />&quot;Quite large, i'm afraid.  We must be careful and fight well.&quot;  Commander Ryone said.  &quot;We are nearing the jump hole.  Activating link technology.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What they heck is link technology?&quot; Seth asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;It is a new technology developed by the Rogues that links ships together to travel through jump holes more easily.  We can move the whole fleet through in one jump with this.&quot; Ryone said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, proceed.&quot; Matthew said.
<br />
<br />They jumped through and appeared in Colorado.  They were in a cloud and vision was hard.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok let me start the Interceptor.&quot;  Ryone said.
<br />
<br />&quot;What in the **** is an Interceptor?&quot; Seth said, this time with a bit of anger in his voice.  It was obvious he didn't like the Rogues much.
<br />
<br />&quot;It can intercept messages from anyone in a twenty K radius.  Even messages on the secure channel.&quot; Ryone replied. &quot;Hey, i've got something!&quot;
<br />
<br />The message had a bit of static but was still understandable.
<br />
<br />&quot;I wonder what is taking Hispania so long?&quot; a Liberty officer said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Maybe the stupid Rogues got them lost.&quot;  another replied, and they all laughed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, it's a good thing we recieved notice about their suprise attack on Colorado.  Most of our fleet is here, so they will never escape this system alive!&quot;  the first officer said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's go check the jump hole again, see if they are here yet.&quot;  The other officer said.
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to get out of here now!&quot; Ryone said. &quot;We can't let the Liberty fleet find us!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok Katana quickly move out!&quot; Matthew ordered.
<br />
<br />&quot;We can go to Ouray, our base in this system.  Liberty doesn't know of it's existance.&quot;  Ryone said.
<br />
<br />The ships zoomed away toward Ouray.  The trip was luckily relatively uneventful, with only a small Liberty patrol crossing Katana's path.  Finally, they reached Ouray, or what was left of it.
<br />
<br />Ouray had been uterly destroyed, with only a few chunks of the asteroid base remaining.  Ruined ship wrecks lied everywhere and a few lifeless, charred bodies floated nearby the devestated base.
<br />
<br />&quot;Liberty!  They will pay for this in blood!&quot; Ryone roared.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh, Ryone,&quot;  Rick said, trembeling, &quot;I think we have a bigger problem!&quot;
<br />
<br />Approching them at an extremely quick pace was a giant Liberty fleet.
<br />
<br />&quot;That must be the fleet that destroyed Ouray,&quot;  Seth yelled, &quot;and they're coming back for seconds!&quot;</div>
