			<div class="content">@Picard- No problem man, we have it more than covered.
<br />@Arilias- Perhaps, but if we set a limit, then we will have 4 or 5 fleets right at the limit, with the same amount of ships, and then it will just be a stand-off, because no one can get an advantage.  The Junkers, etc can build more if the want, they just havn't chose to yet.
<br />@OC- Can you give me a list of exactl;y how many fleets and bases you have in Gamma?  Thanks, it will help me resolve the battle sooner.
<br />
<br />The GMG built:
<br />20 Warships
<br />80 Battleships
<br />500 Eagles
<br />They will be in Sigma-13
<br />
<br />The GMG has ships patrolling all entrances to Omicron Gamma.  They are not in the battle, however.
<br />
<br />BHG:
<br />Building:
<br />QRF
<br />200 U WS
<br />1000 WS
<br />5000 wngs GrW
<br />
<br />My Great Whites in Omega-3 are attacking Omega-5.
<br />Please give the HA's numbers in that system.
<br />
<br />Expect results from Gamma early this week, and for Omega-7 after that.
<br />
<br />I am making a new rule.
<br />All battle plans are no longer going to be posted here!  E-mail them directly to me.
<br />That will prevent any cheating on the battles.  However, you can still post your unit numbers here.  Thank you!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">=News Flash!=
<br />
<br />We are reciving reports that the liberty rogues, once thought long dead and buried, may be alive and well. Several convoys headed for the fronts have been attacked by ships of unknown designs, claiming the convoys for the rogues and sending one escort back to base to spread the word that this new force is ready to handle anyone attempting to destroy them.
<br />
<br />One pilot reports that they had several cannons on the new heavy fighters internalized for protection and that the guns were much more powerful than any used by the rogues before.
<br />
<br />It is belived from faint comm chatter picked up by bases in the vicinities of the attacks that these new ships are called &quot;Alliances&quot;. We will provide more information as it becomes de-classified.
<br />=End Newsflash=
<br />
<br />
<br />Okay, here is basicly what the rogues have done since they basicly dissapeared.
<br />
<br />At the beginning of the conflict, during the testing of the new jumpdrives and such, they detected a new jumphole forming on the far outskirts of the cortez system that lead to a system uncharted by anyone before them. After a raid on the liberty main computer that accidentally turned up a complete history of liberty's near forgotten parent nation of america, along with all it's culture, the rogues decided to take on a new destiny, and left for the new system, christened
<br />New America by the newly born idealists in the organization, and minimized the presence on all of their stations in the known systems.
<br />
<br />They found 3 planets, one barely habitable, and one that could possibly terriformed. Also, it had a reasonably large asteroid belt encircling the inner two planet's orbits, while a gas giant with several moons kept the outer section vacummed.
<br />
<br />They cristened the habitable planet &quot;New Philidelphia&quot; and began construction on a docking ring for it and built themselves a fighter construction/ temporary headquarters facility out of the largest asteroid in the belt, which the cristened &quot;Boston&quot;. It was there that they began research into the Alliance class VHFs, finally developing them at about the time of bretoina's withdrawal of military support from the axis of power. Also at this time, the docking rings for New philidelphia and the under terraforming planet &quot;New Richmond&quot; were completed, allowing for the rogues to finally strech out and begin to truely expand. They have been secretly recruiting once more since the docking ring completions among the houses to try and get the best of each house's potential, with pilots from all houses who are fed up with the war and want to see someone who is mostly neutral try to end it.
<br />
<br />A few days after the completion of the docking rings, they began work on a capital ship shipyard, called &quot;Seattle&quot; so that they could match liberty's navy.
<br />It was designed to have 10 ship bays, but they dropped it down to 8 to complete it in time.
<br />
<br />They only completed it just a few days before the convoy raids began, so that they could study the new weapons in use by the houses and develop a unified fleet to counter these threats. 
<br />
<br />Currently they have:
<br />
<br />500 mules (Many used to harvest resources from the asteroid feild for use on the new shipyard and now the captial ships.  The rest are used to haul back missle loadouts from the convoys as well as replacement guns being shipped to the outer shipyards of the houses.)
<br />450 bloodhounds (Many have been scrapped to supply resources for the new Alliance class fighters, but the remaining ones have been upgraded to handle class 6 equipment to keep enough manuverablility to be survivable, yet pack enough punch to accomplish it's job. New construction on the upgraded version of this class is now being considered.)
<br />700 wolfhounds (These fighters have also been upgraded, putting more armor and faster engines on them. A step class to replace them due to the other houses faster, more powerful fighters is being tenatively called the Deerhound.)
<br />300 Alliance class fighters (Compareable to the rapier class fighter in abilities, and now being equipped with cloaks salvaged from reinland escorts, this ship is dangerous and heavily armed with 5 class 10 guns and 4 class 10 turret mounts. 
<br />The ship is belived to be slightly more manuverable than the rapier, as well as faster, but it is hoped that this matchup does not come into play anytime soon.)
<br />
<br />None of the houses or organizations know about the hole, as it is about 400 k out from the center of the cortez system. In fact, the pirates were chasing a navy fighter out there when they discovered it. However, it is expected that the rogues may contact the rogue LSF soon to ask that they move in with them and break off the alliance with the corsairs and outcasts.
<br />
<br />They are now building the first battleships of a new class, designed to outmanuver and outclass the current battleships in survivablility.
<br />
<br />It carries 75 fighters, and has 2 large forward only guns, partially designed off of liberty's cruiser cannon. What is unusal about this ship is the design. They designed it partially based off of the history of the americas before liberty.=, taking cues from various places, eventually coming up with a fearsome design from the past. WIth a large engineering hull containing the ship's main torpedo launchers and fighter bays, with two large (Currently used as weapon platorms until they can get their hands on intersystem jump technology) nacell type strutures connected to both it and the crew quarters and command center saucer structure, with a neck-like struture connecting the saucer to the engineering hull. The saucer carries 6 main guns, 3 lower-sode, 3 upper side, based partially off liberty designs, but changed slightly to allow for a higher firing rate at the loss of some stopping power. IT also carries one fighter bay where the in planning bombers will be stored. it also carries the 4th torpedo launcher of the ship, the 1&amp;2 mounted forward on the engineering hull, the 3 on the rear of the ship. The rogues have recently developed a torpedo launcher capibile of firering any type of torpedo, vampire, sunslayer and any others in existance, though it is slightly bulky and take some time to change arment types. The engineering hull, where the main drive unit is stored, also has the new device that allows this ship to have it's soon to be unpresidented manuverability. When the rogues tried to find a way to build an intersystem drive, they accindentally discovered a process where space can be warped slightly to drop the apparent mass of an object. Thus, they can make their battleship manuver like a gunship. The engineering hull carries the aformentioned forward guns as well as torpedo launchers, and also carries 7 flak turrets, with an increased fire rate, and 5 secondary offensive turrets, which have a very high fire rate, compareable to some fighter's gun fire rates. However, it suffered a loss of power efficency and damage potential as well.  The class also has an experimental battleship designed shield, which has been only semi-sucsessful in testing. The rogues hope to have the bugs worked out soon. The class's name? In honor of the  once venitrable ship that served the once budding america's navy so well, as well as honoring the country now lost to the destructive liberty, they are calling this class the Consitutions.
<br />
<br />The ships currently being built are:

<br />(LFS Means &quot;Liberating Force Ship&quot;  LFC mean &quot;Liberating Force Code&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />LFS-Constitution  LFC-1 (First ship of the class)
<br />LFS-Hornet  LFC-2
<br />LFS-Midway  LFC-3
<br />LFS-Honolulu  LFC-4
<br />LFS-San Fansisco LFC-5
<br />LFS- Philedelphia LFC-6
<br />LFS-Atlanta LFC-7
<br />LFS-Mobile LFC-8
<br />
<br />
<br />Planning is halfway done on a new carrier class to supplement the Constitutions, and a heavy cruiser class is under intital planning. If the new space-warp system works, it will be incorperated onto both classes, giving the rogues an immense edge.
<br />
<br />To increase the numbers of ships being built now that industry is in place to support construction, a second shipyard is being built just opposite of the docking ring on New Philidelphia and began work on a new defensive station class, currently code-named &quot;Lousiana&quot; to protect the shipyards. 20 weapon platforms have been built at the entrance jumphole, and while the rogues haven't been able to create new holes or develop a intersystem drive, they have managed to develop a device that can stabilize jumpholes inefinately to allow them assurance that the hole will never collapse. They are currently semi-sucessful at re-routing the hole exit point, thus allowing their raids. However, one raiding party in 10 is lost due to jumphole shifts in mid-transit.
<br />
<br />Message for Rogue LSF only:
<br />
<br />If you are not the commander of the rogue LSF, this message will self-destruct if opened. 
<br />
<br />The rogues have changed their ways and wish to offer an alliance to re-take liberty and bring forth it's once had glory. We will gladly offer you our system if you will break off your alliance with the Hispainia desendants. We will soon have powerful battleships to escort you to our system and to fend off any and all attacks by hispania. We should soon be able to re-route a jumphole to your system to allow direct access to our system for you to evacuate through. If you accept, we will upgrade all your current capital ships with certain experimental technologys that should give you an advantage in combat. 
<br />If you do not, we wil consider you another part of liberty's corruption to stop and will send our fleet after you and utterly destroy you. Give your response to the messanger and allow him escort back to our jumphole.

<br />By the way, this is just speculation on my part but in regards to the prometheus project ....

<br />The hand device used to kill the intruder sounds an awful lot like something from

			<div class="content">I have a suggestion in regards to the creation of fleets and bases.
<br />
<br />There should be a certain ammount of real world time required to build something in the RPG. The larger the thing your building the longer it takes. So building a shipyard from scratch might take a month. Mabey a capital ship would be two weeks. Also, a shipyard should only be able to work on a certain number of vessels at once. Or possibly assign resource costs to build things. 
<br />
<br />Just some suggestions so that we don't have to deal with fleets reappearing over night.</div>

			<div class="content">Apparently, just now. Ah, well, if he will honor the rogues new code of honor, he is welcome to the resources of New America and the fighter shipyards of Boston.
<br />
<br />He'll also get New Richmond as a Second prize!
<br />
<br />And when we try to find a new system, we will split it's resources even 50/50 with the junkers.
<br />
<br />=News Flash!=
<br />
<br />The rogues have struck again, this time daring into the Detroit debries field to raid the DSE storage facility there. A Navy patrol passing by at the time reported a JUMP HOLE opened out of the blue and 5 squads of the new Alliance class VHF jumped in and demolished the defenses of the stations. The patrol retreated when the fighters turned their attention upon them and destroyed at least 2 of the patrol ships. A Navy  fleet was dispatched to stop them, but the depot was completely stripped when they arrived. No sign of the jump hole was found other than elevated radiation counts normally associated with Jump holes. 
<br />
<br />Also, liberty rogue ships have been now spotted in nearly every system, attacking only enough to strip certain freighters of engine components, alloys, H-fuel and once, in a massive attack, a train full of the new &quot;Super Fuel&quot;. It is belived that these cargo thefts are gearing up the rogues for a new campeign of terror against liberty, and possibly every house in sirus, including hispania.....
<br />
<br />The war may stop long enough to face this new threat if it becomes greater.... more news should soon be availible.
<br />
<br />=End broadcast.=
<br />
<br />
<br />    Not much is known about the rogue's new leader, President Richardson.
<br />
<br />What is known, is that he was the one who discovered liberty's tainted past and present in the fate-changing raid on their main data base. Overnight, he became the voice proclaiming that the rogues should dedicate themselves to reforming liberty, and ending the centurys of corruption. When the navy stepped up attacks against the rogues and their top leaders were killed. he took command of the rogues and began a quest to finda safe haven in the coming storm. He got his wish when a rogue heavy fighter flight stumbled across the jumphole to a remote system. History once again becomes jumbled. Apparently, the rogue bases were in final stages of shutdown when the liberty navy began it's final push against them. Richardson withdrew all remaining personelle from known space into the new system they controlled, named New America. From there, he has turned the rogues from a disorganized band of theives and honorless men and women, into a fighting force with one purpose, Reforming the corrupt liberty goverment and restoring her parent country's founder's vision. He has instituted the govermental style of old america, complete with elections to determine the rogues leaders, and for the past few months, he has managed to prove that democracy does work right, and that the rogues are far from over.....

<br />Sir, if you recive this message, I formally apologize for the rogues former actions against your company, and it's properties. However, I belive we both can come to accords. We have a technology that could allow you to do things never before imagined with jump holes and gates, and we would like your help in setting up tradelanes and a jumpgate equipped with our advanced technology. Should the axis turn upon you for helping the hispanic alliance, or the alliance turn upon you, we will offer you safe haven in our system. If you would like to talk about this offer, please send a note back with the courier.
<br />
<br />*Secret message sent to bretonia*
<br />
<br />Your majesty, I would like to offer you peace with the rogues and a way of protecting yourself from the axis and alliance should either become hostile. My fellow rogues have done things that they now regret, and we wish to help you recover from your damages. We are preparing to begin explorations, and we are willing to offer several systems should we find many habitably ones. We have noticed that you cannot side with the alliance or axis, and are offering a choice C, if you will. We only ask that you help us in our fight to reform liberty and kusari from the twisted images of their former selves. If you wish to talk further with me on the matter, please give a note for our courier to bring back to us and we ask that you not follow him.
<br />
<br />*Top Secret message to farmer alliance leader.*
<br />
<br />Sir, as you are aware, the axis is getting out of hand. The rogues came back to reform liberty, but when we do, we find all of sirus screwed up. We know you have suffered greatly since the start of this war, and we intend to end it as soon as humanely possible with our current resources. We need a fleet, and we have technologys that could give you an unprecidented advantage over any attacking force. Please assist us in stopping this threat. If you wish to talk further, please give a note to the courier, and don't follow him. I'll arrange a conference with you and several other leaders as soon as possible.
<br />*Transmission to liberty command.*
<br />
<br />Liberty command, I am most displeased at the twisted image of liberty's former glory you have become. The rogues, having evidence of this, have reformed themselves in the hopes that should worst come to past, they could become what the house's true founding fathers wanted it to become. We, while not being proud of our choices in the matter, are willing to forgive your transgressions if you reform immediately. If not, we will build our forces and CRUSH you. We will not argue the matter further, and oh, by the way, don't bother trying to track the jump hole this transmission came through, you'll never find it in the same place twice.
<br />
<br />
<br />Advancement!
<br />
<br />Rogue scientists have managed to produce a working MARC. (Matter/Antimatter Reactor Core) This new, more effiecent reactor has freed us from having to make costly raids for H-fuel and superfuel, and we can now concentrate our gas resources on supplying our fighters. All ships will be immediately refitted with these new cores.
<br />
<br />Prototype of Constitution Battleships completed!
<br />
<br />LFS-Constution Launched 3 hours ago on her shakedown cruise. She will test her new technologys up against  a liberty convoy, hopefully sucessful. The next ship under construction is:
<br />
<br />LFS-Kep Salu LFC-9 (Future Flagship of the fleet)
<br />LFS-Enterprise LFC-10 (Enterprise class Battlecruiser)
<br />LFS-Essex LFC-11 (Essex class carrier)
<br />LFS- Buffalo LFC-12 (Battlecruiser)
<br />
<br />Yes, we have completed 3 more docks on Seattle, and hope to have our final number of 15 docks done by the time Lousiana reaches the halfway point.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, work has been completed on another 100 alliance class fighters, 75 deployed to the constitution. The Deerhound class has been completed and is in full production. The new &quot;Freedom&quot; class bombers are in secondary design phases. They will incorperate a second generation version of the Mirage torpedo launcher, as well as cloaking and other significant leaps ahead by the rogues.
<br />
<br />Planning has begun on incorperating  a small scale version of the Jump Hole Manipulator on all captial ships. It is hoped that work will be done by the end of the year and have all captial ships refitted shortly thereafter.
<br />
<br />Also, breifings have been drawn up for a possible new light fighter class, which may or may not go ahead.
<br />
<br />With so much of the sirus sector suffering, the rogues have decided to place their plans against liberty on hold while they develop a fleet to bring into check the axis and alliance. They hope to ally themselves with several major powers which have gone neutral due to the viscious behavior of the 2 powers, and and put together a fighting force technologically advanced enough to fight back against both powers massive ultra-powered ships.
<br />
<br />=NewsFlash=
<br /> In what appears to be the opening move in a campeign specificly designed to end the alliance/axis war, the liberty rogues have revealed their first major ship in a daring attack on war supplys going to the front lines. The class, belived to be called &quot;Constitution&quot; outmanuvered several reinland warships in AMAZING feats of acrobatics, ripped the fuel and missles from the convoy, and escaped into a jump hole that appeared from no-where. The rogues have sent us a transmission from a temporary jumphole that claims they attacked to start the end of the war, and to stop the conflict before more lives are lost. Both the alliance and axis are outraged that they are interfering, but are powerless to stop them, as there base station is unknown, and they have scoured all known systems for them.
<br />
<br />This just in, we have actual footage from the battle, we're putting it up now.
<br />
<br />*Screen flicks to the gun camera on a reinland fighter. A constitution speeds toward the convoy it escorts. Several warships turn to destroy it, but it pulls a manuver that should not be capible of happening in a ship it's size and slices between 2 of the mighty beasts, it's newly re-enforced shield actually damaging the monster's sheilds, leaving an electical discharge storm in it's wake. It continues to dodge fire, destroying a gunship and several VHFs with flak turrets as it comes up fast on the convoy. It's secondary guns quickly blow the cargo bays open on all the ships, and it tractors in the material. The view suddenly turns as the pilot notices something happening. A jumphole rips open space, and the LFS Constitution shoots into it. One of the warships tries to follow, but as it begins to enter the hole, it collapses, crushing the forward third of the ship.*
<br />
<br />Wow......    for those of you who just saw that, the rogues are taking what appears to be their new manifesto seriously. This is a grave threat to the colonies, and yet an awsome power to be harnesed. I think that this could well indeed be the end of the war. Let us hope the rogues have no intention of making war on all the colonies.......
<br />
<br />=End broadcast.=
<br />
<br />
<br />A somber look at what could be the end of one problem and the start of another for the oppresive axis and alliance. Better hurry up and quit fighting, because between the rogues getting pissed and the secret project that nutty professer at agiera is working on that could possibly destroy the colonies, things are about to get majorly shaken up.

<br />The Liberty Rogues, Liberators or Pirates?: With the return of the Liberty Rogues to Sirius as a force of supposed idealists, Ageira executives have been considering the possibility that these former pirates might embrace our own vision of a benevolent, united sector. Possible negotiations are being considered, but do to the current galactic situation no formal friendship has been extended.
<br />
<br />The Ageira Security Fleet, consisting of nineteen Innovation-class battleships under the flagship ATS Destiny, has been sent to the borders of the New Columbia System. No word on the exact plans at this time.

<br />The ATS Origin arrived in Bretonia earlier this morning and is currently awaiting commands from the government.

<br />
<br />
<br />Do you REALLY think you can chase us down? Besides, are you sure the radiation hasn't been altered slightly with the destruction of a rienland warship right smack dab in the middle of the exit hole? Not to mention the fact that we cover for this eventuallity by routing the hole through the entire network? And honsetly, are you really worried about barely enough of that fuel to power a gunship for a day or two? We're not even gonna use it for ourselves, we're shipping it to the junkers. If you can find them......
<br />
<br />Sure, try to enter the system, we'll have our 8 ship squad of battleships waiting. We can out-manuver your heavy guns, and thanks to our marc, we can take several hits from your bombers, and we can return the favor with our mirage torpedo launchers. By the time you track us down, we'll be ready to fight for freedom. 
<br />
<br />Actually, send your best ship to Alaska, out in the depths where no-one can come onto us. We'll send the Kep Salu when she's done. Who wins the fight can keep the gas. Re-enforcements come in, and we'll keep it and start our contigency plans and be long gone before you arrive.
<br />
<br />And do you REALLY want to stop people trying to stop this war by any means it takes, even if it must be illegal?
<br />
<br />
<br />Completed:
<br />LFC's 2-8.
<br />
<br />LFC 9-12 expected to be done witin the timeframe in which the axis could possibly track the location of the rogues. Plans being drawn up for an evactuaction should worst come to past to the junker ships. 
<br />
<br />Fighter production stepped up.
<br />
<br />500 Alliances completed with full resources of Seattle
<br />450 Deerhounds built
<br />Research Completed on Freedom class bombers.  200 built at seattle.(2 type 2 mirage torpedo launchers, advanced torpedos loaded in using stolen superfuel, vampire torpedos in as secondary arment. 6 Liberator guns, 8 liberator turrets. Spectral shields type 2 completed and installed on all ships of the class, alliances all refitted to new shields.)
<br />Protector class light fighters in secondary production
<br />
<br /> Mines have been layed at all possible insertion points into the system using new advanced anti-matter warheads. New antimatter torpedos in secondary research phase.
<br />All raids temporarily suspended while further stealth modifications are made to the re-router. Control confirms hole was routed through omega, iota, sigma and tau systems. It is unlikely their pursurers will find them anytime within the next 4 months, as they will be chasing dying radiation throughout the systems.
<br />Main bulk of popluation evaced to star observed outside boundary nebula. Intial reports promising.
<br />
<br /> Captain of the Kep Salu
<br />
<br />Trekkie and proud of it!
