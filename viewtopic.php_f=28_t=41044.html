			<div class="content">THE PHOENIX RPG MOD
<br />
<br />This is a mod that I've been working on for a while now, and it's coming along quite nicely.  We currently have a beta version and server running, as well as <a href='http://www.phoenix-rpg.ca/forums/index.php' Target=_Blank>forums,</a> and a <a href='http://www.phoenix-rpg.ca/~phoenix_rpg/' Target=_Blank>site.</a> 
<br />
<br /><b>The Story:  (From our site)    </b>
<br />
<br />800 to 820 AS. Just a short twenty years.
<br />
<br />A lot can happen in twenty years.
<br />
<br />Destruction of Freeport Seven by means still not known.
<br />
<br />Invasion of Sirius by an alien species the nature of which is still known only to a select few, bringing the colonies to the brink of all out-war.
<br />
<br />Revolution in Rheinland immediately after the death of Chancellor Niemann.
<br />
<br />The Kusari government weakened after years of fruitless battle with Blood Dragons and Golden Chrysanthemums.
<br />
<br />In years to come, historians would call that era the Years of Struggle, as Sirius underwent more turmoil and confusion than had been seen in over a century.
<br />
<br />* - * - * - *
<br />
<br />Sirians thought they'd seen it all, but nothing could prepare them for the momentous events of 810 AS.
<br />
<br />Cryer Pharmaceuticals had finally made the breakthrough they were looking for: a Cardamine substitute that kept an addict alive, but didn't change his DNA and could be administered in small doses. This alone electrified the medical profession, as addicts clamored for treatment, successfully reintegrating into society. 
<br />
<br />The leaders of the four Houses unanimously agreed that now was the time to right some old injustices: the Dons of Malta and the Elders of Crete were told that every Outcast and Corsair would be offered a blanket amnesty if they ended the piracy and drug running, and opened up legitimate trade and cultural linkages with the rest of Sirius; in return the Outcasts would get the substitute Cardamine for free in perpetuity, and both Omicron Alpha and Gamma would get trade lanes and preferential terms on goods they needed the most. 
<br />
<br />After months of protracted negotiations, the Outcast Dons decided to accept the plan, tempted by the Cardamine substitute that would give Outcasts' lives a semblance of normality. At the same time, they announced a cease-fire with the Corsairs. Within just a few days, the Elders of Crete announced they would accept the cease-fire, and not wanting to be outdone by the Outcasts, also openly entered talks with Rheinland to combat the Red Hessians. 
<br />
<br />But a more startling revelation was yet to come. for secret negotiations resulted in a bold announcement: the long-overdue creation of House Hispania, after the sleeper ship that had failed to bring the Spanish-speaking peoples successfully to Sirius. Hopes ran high all over Sirius, for this was to mark the end of long years of ostracism and persecution of people who had a right to be considered equals to the rest of Sirius. 
<br />
<br />810 AS marked the beginning of a glowing new era... or so people thought.
<br />
<br />But there were those among the Outcasts and Corsairs who did not want to be Hispanians, either because old hatreds and rivalries die hard, or because they were criminals at heart rather than ordinary people forced, by circumstance, into criminal activity. 
<br />
<br />And so for the first ten years of its existence, House Hispania has maintained a slender and tenuous hold on the new systems allocated to it: Navarre, Aragon, New Madrid and Castille. The Hispanic Armada barely maintains order in the capital systems, while the Hispanic Police struggles for new recruits to help keep public order. 
<br />
<br />It is in this environment which the freelancers of Sirius now make their living. In some ways, more peaceful. In others, more dangerous. The trade lanes in Hispania, while they aid the flow of materials and people, do little to stop the crime problem. 
<br />
<br />The revitalized government of Rheinland still contends with Red Hessians who did not join with the Bundschuh, Unioners and LWB in toppling the old government after the still-mysterious death of Chancellor Niemann. Liberty and Bretonia, more stable and still prosperous, contend with their own criminal factions as they always have. And Kusari is now on a precarious footing, with the Blood Dragons awaiting the day when the old Shogun, the same Shogun that has been in power for over twenty-five years, finally dies. 
<br />
<br />The years since the destruction of Freeport Seven have been difficult ones, but for freelancers, there is always money to be made.... for this is Phoenix. A place where a nation will rise again.
<br />
<br />* - * - * - *
<br />
<br />As you can see, this mod will continue the Freelancer story through lots of infocard and news updates, encounter changes, new factions, etc.  We have a server up, and we plan to run the mod on the server and create an RP community and atmosphere with custom factions, custom news written by players, and many elements of the mod directed towards roleplay and making the mod fun and interesting to play.
<br />
<br />
<br />Current Features of the Mod! 
<br />
<br />- 2 New Factions! (Hispanic Armada and Hispania Police)
<br />- 22 New Ships!
<br />- Redo of Omicrons Alpha, Beta, Theta, and Gamma, with new encounters.
<br />- 3 new stations (Hispania Station, Cordoba Station, Seville Station)
<br />- Lots of renamings and base faction changes.
<br />- New tradelanes in Taus, Sigmas, and Omegas.
<br />- NPC encounters with new ships.
<br />- Totally new and more realistic physics system!
<br />- AI rebuilt from ground up to make them MUCH harder.
<br />- Equipment/hardpoints system totally redone.
<br />- All weapon and shield types rebalanced.
<br />- New power generators avaliable!
<br />- New wrecks, including battleship wrecks!
<br />
<br />Upcoming Features for the Mod! 
<br />
<br />- 5-10 new ships!
<br />- More bases!
<br />- More encounters for new factions!
<br />- 20-30 new weapons!
<br />- New commodities!
<br />- New equipment!
<br />- Updated news and infocards!
<br />- LESS BUGS!
<br />- 7 new beam weapons that you get to build from parts you find!
<br />- 2 new ships that you get to build from parts you find!
<br />- Weekly downloadable update packets!
<br />- And much more!
<br />
<br />The mod has been built off of Argh's excellent XML Toolkit v. 2.2!
<br />

<br />815 AS marks another year of hard work for some Sirians, and struggle for others. Even as Liberty and Bretonia continue to be icons of stability and prosperity, Rheinland's economy is still precarious, recovering from mismanagement and neglect. Its government contends with Red Hessians which did not join with the Bundschuh, LWB and Unioners in the rebellion to depose the old government. Kusari plays a waiting game. The Shogun has been in power for twenty years and there is no clear successor. The Blood Dragons and Golden Chrysanthemums eagerly await the day he dies.
<br />
<br />And in the Omicron systems, the Outcasts and Corsairs are in a full-scale civil war with the Hispania Liberation Front, a group composed of members of both peoples who no longer want to engage in criminal activity and piracy, and agitate for legal recognition of a House of Hispania. Once the floodgates were cracked open just a little bit by people who questioned the status quo, the torrent was not long in following as many others who had harbored misgivings about dealing in drugs for enrichment at the expense of thousands of innocents, or committing acts of piracy and theft to fuel an insane plan to take over Rheinland's star systems, finally found an outlet for those misgivings among people who had seen another way, a better one - and took it.
<br />
<br />They occupy a strange no-man's-land, not officially recognized by either the four Houses, nor the Elders of Crete or the Dons of Malta. The breakthrough by Cryer Pharmaceuticals, rumored to be a Cardamine substitute, has not yet been made official. So Outcast and Corsair loyalist factions fight pitched battles with equally-committed HLF members, while the Houses watch largely from the sidelines.
<br />
<br />Order, never very much a strong point in the Omicrons, is breaking down as the Elders and Dons no longer maintain absolute unquestioned power over all their people.  As a result, the Corsairs and Outcasts have been forced to pull units back towards their home systems in the Omicrons, which are now the front lines in the civil war.  The Corsairs have all but withdrawn from the attempted invasion of Bretonia, and as such, the Mollys now have much more freedom than they previously enjoyed, now being the largest Bretonian pirate organization.  Similarly, the Outcasts have withdrawn from Liberty, Kusari, and Bretonia space, and their allies; the Rogues, Hackers, and Golden Chrysanthemums, are now dealing with their own internal issues as the sudden lack of the addictive Cardamine has weakened them.
<br />
<br />This is still Sirius, where freelancers still make money. But the winds of change are beginning to upset old friendships and alliances, and enterprising people know that to ride these winds can mean success and wealth, or failure and an escape pod.
<br />
<br />This is Phoenix, where a nation will rise again after eight hundred years.</div>

			<div class="content">Announcing the next version of the Phoenix Mod: <b>Phoenix 1.93! </b>
<br />
<br />We have some awesome stuff planned for this new version, here's a sneak peek at some of them.
<br />
<br />First of all, we are radically rebalancing most everything.  I am leveling out NPC encounters and mission difficulties all over Sirius, so all NPCs are equally hard.  Missions where players can get ship and weapon parts can be found everywhere now.  Also, we're rebalancing ships and equipment, so all ship types are directly on-par with one another, and ship classes are equal but concentrated on different things.  Weapons will be handled differently as well, with weapons divided into tech levels, meaning that weapons and equipment in the same tech level will be on par, but they get better the higher one gets in the tech levels.  
<br />
<br />Second, we will be including a destructable universe, as well as changes to the universe to reflect the mod story.  (Like that mythical 5th house being established after 850 years)  Also expect some new systems to be discovered.  
<br />
<br />Third, we have a technology tree for our factions.  Factions on our server will be able to research new items of technology to improve their power in the universe.  The tech levels of equipment and ships can be unlocked by factions once they have aquired enough &quot;Tech Credits&quot;.  
<br />
<br />Lastly, to show how powerful a faction is in the universe, they will have faction &quot;influence&quot;.  Influence will govern a faction's power in each system.  This will change on a regular basis, and faction NPC counts will rise or fall with it.  
<br />
<br />Finally, we are expecting to automate much of this process through a new server operator and some forum/website plugins that will allow players to affect things on the server through the forums.  We have programmers working on this in C++, C#, and PHP.  
<br />
<br />If you are interested in helping us on this awesome project, we need people who can code, program (C or PHP), and mod.  If you're interested, please email me or visit our wesite at <a href='http://www.phoenix-rpg.ca' Target=_Blank>www.phoenix-rpg.ca</a>.
