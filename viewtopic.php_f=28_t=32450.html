			<div class="content">The mod is OOOOhhh so close to completion now. We could use a few more testers to check out the new systems to speed things along. At the moment I recon it will be ready for release in about two weeks but if we had 4 or 5 more testers this could be cut to a week.

<br />
<br />The Dog Fight Mod Details
<br />
<br />THE DOG FIGHT MOD STORY
<br />It all started a little over a hundred years ago with the appearance of the alien race the Kon. The Kon have been major traders for aeons and have been trading with the Dom Kavosh for longer than man existed.
<br />With the increase in the number of alien artefacts being activated, the Kon had detected their energy traces; they sent an envoy to find out what was causing this. Discovering that humans had repopulated the system they opened trade negotiations, supplying the locations of nearby systems and helping with the construction of the jump gates to enable us to get to their newly constructed supper trade system. As unlike them we don&#8217;t have worm drive engines and need &#8220;Primitive forms of assisted travel&#8221; as the Kon called the jump gates.
<br />They guard the only access to the universe beyond systems and control every thing to and from this vast group of systems. Though there are rumours of its location to be brought and some say you can work out where it is from these. They also control what technologies get through to us and the prices.
<br />There is apparently a good trade to be had in humans and human body parts to feed certain races. Is this why the prison population has dropped so dramatically in the last fifty years? There are places that pay exceptional amounts for both live and dead humans or even bits of them. Many a rich man claims to be that way because of knowing a prison warder, but it&#8217;s a dangerous trip and just as many don&#8217;t make it back.
<br />There is a massive supply route in place supplying our goods and bringing theirs back, which of course has been a wind fall for the pirates and because of this you have to make sure your rep is right before even attempting to enter the Kon system as they kill on sight any who are slightly unfriendly. Because of this the pirates lay in wait in the outer systems hunting in packs. Only the ace pirates get to go there as the pickings are plentiful but so are the risks. The Liberty Navy insists that none of the pirates get past their check point and there is no other entrance to what has now become known as the death zone. One source even stated that the transports were smuggling the pirates and their ships in, but the large numbers found there make this implausible.
<br />With the good always comes the bad. Another race has set up in the Kon system, also known as the Konflict system because of all the fighting there. The new race the Ad Min is even older than the Kon with technologies we can only dream of, to us they are indestructible. They take pilots and infect them with a parasite which gives them full control over the pilots, who are then sent out on patrol for the duration of their calculated decaying life span, never eating again and breathing a liquid made up of a small amount of added sustenance (acquired from those they kill) and the pilots own recycled body waste. These pilots are called the DEATH, steer clear as you will die no one other than time has killed one and their time is short and your body will extend their life.
<br />It is said that they even consume their own unused limbs (their ships are controlled by thought) to survive longer in the ever vain hope of rescue, the parasites playing with their tortured minds.
<br />The Ad Min have declared war on a small but universally hated clan called the CHEATERS and these are the preferred pilots to receive the control parasite. The Ad Min have the ability to sniff out the Cheaters and so called F1 users over several systems then the dreaded Blood Red Ad Min ships appear. Though the cheaters and F1 users run they can not hide and do not survive long never to be seen again. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED THIS IS THE ONLY WARNING YOU WILL GET.
<br />It is also said that the universe beyond, as it&#8217;s become known, is full of even more horrors of which we can not comprehend. The few pilots who have managed to return from the universe beyond ended their lives whimpering in corners of mental institutions, either from horror or sheer wonderment of what they saw, but never quite being believed.
<br />The Fugitives are the only group to get any real sort of understanding with the Kon but true to all pirates they are unpredictable and can attack anyone with out warning, friend or foe.
<br />There is another race starting to appear only a few sighting&#8217;s have been reported but it seems they are connected to the nomads some how, who them selves are being encountered more. The prophets of doom as well as the well known God Squad are warning of a return of the Dom Kavosh, will they return to reclaim their system.
<br />
<br />So Says The Book Of Tank.
<br />
<br />What&#8217;s in the Mod
<br /> 
<br />SHIPS:
<br />Seeing is believing and you still won&#8217;t 41 of Baene&#8217;s ships.
<br />Visit Baene&#8217;s forums to see the ships he makes. <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamer-forums.com/vision3d/index.php">www.gamer-forums.com/vision3d/index.php</a><!-- w -->
<br />WEPS:
<br />Baene has worked hard on these as well they all fit in with the mod as it was intended. There are no mega-torps or missiles!! Pilot skill is required to fight it out with guns. If you want to have two second battles and make mega-money in no time then this mod is not for you. Well you can make mega-money, but ships are expensive and the weapons are a lot as well.
<br />COMMODITIES:
<br />At this time there are a limited number of new commodities as this is a major job on its own. What I plan to do is sort them out in an interim release prior to stage 2.
<br />There are places where you can collect goods and lots of them if you're into trading, but don&#8217;t expect to have an easy time! You will need to be able to fight.
<br />There are no transports etc but there are freighter fighters that can carry a good amount of cargo, so don&#8217;t expect traders to be an easy target.
<br />NPC&#8217;s:
<br />Npc's have regen shields, use nanos and batts. They also have better ships.
<br />SYSTEMS:
<br />A couple of standard systems have been slightly modified and there are four new ones. There are five factions that were in standard FL but either not used or only partially used, these are now fully functional, with their own bribes, ships, bases, missions, rep, npc&#8217;s etc.
<br />There are four new factions all are fully functional, with their own bribes, ships, bases, missions, rep, npc&#8217;s etc. Except for the Admin which has its own fleet of npc&#8217;s to guard the Admin bases. As you would gather from the name these are for server admin only.
<br />There are 24 fully functioning new bases, all with rumours (still being added to for stage two), bribes, missions, commodities, ships, weps, new characters (have a drink in the bars with well known FL community people). Two more new bases with ships, weps, commodities but no rumours or missions yet as this system ties in with stage two, when they will be added.
<br />All new and edited systems are fully populated with their own factions and have Trade lanes, patrol routes, encounters etc.
<br />
<br />MOD GENERAL INFO
<br />This is a Multi-Player only mod, no Single-Player testing has been done and the story line does NOT work. So if you try single player, anything may happen! We are unable to sort any problems that you find in single-player, so please don't report them.
<br />A CLEAN INSTALL OF FL IS REQUIRED TO REMOVE FILES LEFT BEHIND BY FLMM. Fl should ask you to restart your computer after clean install if it does not then you don&#8217;t have a clean install. See the DFM forums for an idiots guide to a clean install.
<br />READ THE INFO ON THE MOD IN FLMM AND ON THE FORUM NO WARNINGS GIVEN OR DISCUSSION ENTERED INTO REGARDING CHEATERS YOU WILL BE BANNED.
<br />Too many cheaters use this as a get out when they get caught IT WILL NOT WORK YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
<br />This is a compilation of ideas from many other mods. If you find anything that looks like some one else&#8217;s work that I have not given credit for then more than likely it is their work, or at very least I got the idea from some of their work. Just because I have messed up and not given them credit in no way means I am claiming it as mine.
<br />This is an on going creation and there will be further releases. All subsequent releases will tie in with this mod THERE WILL BE NO PLAYER WIPES BECAUSE OF UPDATES so you can build a character knowing all player files on the server will be transferred and fully functioning after new releases.
<br />
<br />INFO ON TANK&#8217;S SERVER
<br />As the name suggests this is a fighting mod expect to die lots you wont get rich quick so if you don&#8217;t want to put some time in to it get another mod.
<br />
<br />You can find details on how to do a clean install without loosing files for other mods on our forums. Along with password of the server, forums for bug reports and general chat about this mod.
<br />Forum: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net">http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net</a><!-- m -->
<br />Many thanks to SGT DH of Dickheads Domain for giving us a home.
<br />
<br />All references to &quot;I&quot; mean &quot;Tank&quot; this is my opinion and there is no implication to any other person if this is not legal jargon enough that&#8217;s as good as it gets after all this is a game.
<br />You must be registered at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net">www.dhdomain.cjb.net</a><!-- w --> to play on Tanks server and one char must be the same as your forum name. Logging onto Tanks server means you have read and agree to the rules and regs as posted on <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net">www.dhdomain.cjb.net</a><!-- w --> and you agree to visit the forums prior to logging on to the game server to check for up dates.
<br />Anyone using other mods will be banned, no questions, no warning, no discussion.
<br />Same goes for all cheats, and any one claiming to be an Admin. Admins will be in an Admin ship, Look for the Blood red ones. Any admins NOT in the admin ship are NO LONGER ADMINS, KILL THEM IF YOU SO DESIRE!  Admin names will be on console message board the on a regular basis.
<br />There is a bounty on cheaters! Supply an Admin with the proof of cheating for a 10 mill bounty.
<br />Dock camping is a finable offence as it is considered the act of a coward. First offence will cost you all your funds; Second time you're banned. 
<br />To F1 out of a PVP fight is the act of a coward and you will be fined appropriate to your level.
<br />This is a PVP server!!! You will die. Get used to it! However, players over lvl 30 should be careful who they pick on, as I will not stand for high level players blasting the lower levels. If this happens, admins can arrange for the lower level player to be given the same ship and weapons as you; you will then be required to go one on one pvp and if you lose or refuse to fight, you will go back to level 1 (the lower level player does not keep the higher lvl ship and weapons).
<br />If you have been playing Freelancer for even a short time you know why. If you have only just started then you'll learn the hard way.
<br />
<br />ALL ADMINS HAVE THE FINAL WORD.
<br />
<br />I know it sounds hard but I'm fed up with morons messing up the game for every one else.
<br />
<br />Who changed what from the original game by Microsoft so you can direct any whinges, complaints or claims of copy rights to the correct person.

<br />
<br />Baene would like to thank the following people :
<br />SGT DH for testing
<br />Crabtree and Chips for help with de bugging
<br />Crabtree, for his most excellent Shipscripter. I cut and paste to my heart's content!

<br />Tank, for talking me into this <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />My wife, Michelle for looking over my ships and telling me what was good and what wasn't...seems she was right......AGAIN lol.
<br />Anton for making the INCREDIBLE FLADDRADIUS tool! AWESOME program!
<br />and finally, ALL the tutorial writers who have taken the time to educate me on the finer points of modding Freelancer. Thanks guys!
<br />
<br />NOTE : The ships in this mod OTHER than the ones I released in my ship pack MAY NOT, under ANY circumstances WHATSOEVER be used in ANY OTHER MOD, period, unless I give my WRITTEN permission for such. This is NOT negotiable. These ships are ALL original designs of my own, and I own them, and WILL take immediate action if they are used without MY DIRECT CONSENT.
<br />Thank you!
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks and Enjoy from Tank and Baene
<br />
<br />
<br />Important Information...
<br />The mod is supplied in an exe file format that will install the mod into the Freelancer Mod Manager.
<br />By default the Mod Manager/mods folder is located at:
<br />C:\Program Files\Freelancer Mod Manager/mods if yours is else where then browse to it. After installation you can start the Mod Manager and activate the -
<br />Dog Fight Mod ver7 issue1
<br />
<br />Tip of the day...When a Mod such as this one changes the Version number you may have problems connecting... It's your Firewall. You should be able to manually configure your Firewall software or another way is to remove freelancer from the firewalls program list, so when you restart freelancer it will ask premission to connect it. So if Freelancer freezes when you try to connect to Internet in Multiplayer you'll know what the problem is...

			<div class="content">DOG FIGHT MOD NEW EASIER START AND MUCH MORE 
<br />New to this release. 
<br />Start ship has better shield and more power. 
<br />NPC's in Liberty have less nanoes. 
<br />Tip the quicker you kill them the more they drop.  
<br />Monkey Faction planet operational just no missions yet.
<br />Robot Faction planet operational just no missions yet.
<br />Find the famous. 
<br />Lookout for the famous in bars. Have a drink with  DH, and Chips to name but a few. Tip for stage two release: Get to know where the famous like to drink as in stage two they will give you information on how to get to the New set of systems.(Bp, Glock and many more famous FL people in stage two)  
<br />All 38 new stations fully fitted with ships, wep and commodities where appropriate. (NOTE the 17 bases in Zenith all buy goods but do not all sell goods yet as this ties in with stage two along with missions)
<br />Known Bugs fixed. 
<br />Bounty hinters now have guns. 
<br />Wep loot now no longer crashes game. 
<br />Cap ships can land. 
<br />Known Bugs not fixed. 
<br />None 
<br />Known issues that bug me and not fixed. 
<br />Still a few Info cards messed up. 
<br />99% of all new bases have all new characters however there still some 150 ish to make. I lost count at around 300 new ones so far.
<br />Install instructions 
<br />First do a clean install of Freelancer and FLMM. As FLMM leaves some files behind and can cause crashes. See <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net">www.dhdomain.cjb.net</a><!-- w --> for full instructions on a clean install.
<br />Second. Reinstall Freelancer.
<br />Third. Install Sdk 1.3
<br />Fourth. Install FLMM 1.3
<br />Fifth. Double click on Dog Fight Mod file which is a self installing FLMM file.
<br />Sixth. Activate the mod
<br />And Last HAVE FUN 
<br />This new issue of the Dog Fight Mod will NOT require any player wipes as I have built this mod from the start with the whole intention of never having to do player wipes so you can continue to build your characters. 
<br />Full support forums to be found at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net">www.dhdomain.cjb.net</a><!-- w --> 
<br />Online Multi Player 24/7 Server Tanks New Easy Start DFM ver 7.1 
<br />Full rules for the server to be found at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dhdomain.cjb.net">www.dhdomain.cjb.net</a><!-- w --> where you must be registered to play on my server. 
<br />Check out the under construction Dog Fight Mod website and let me know what you would like to see there.( sorry only Flash version at the moment HTML version for Dial ups to follow) <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dfm.000k.net">www.dfm.000k.net</a><!-- w --> 
<br />Also dedicated new forums under construction <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dfm.000k.net/phpBB/index.php">www.dfm.000k.net/phpBB/index.php</a><!-- w --> pop in and let us know what you would like here. 
<br />Thanks to all who have made this possible. Don't worry I have not finished picking you brains yet Stage two build is already under way.</div>

<br /><b>Dog Fight Mod Stage 2 Release     </b>
<br />
<br />It being some 100 years since the Kon&#8217;s first contacted the humans; their advanced technology is slowly filtering through. First there was the expensive but O so worth it freighter fighters with the new alloy hull&#8217;s and improved engines, followed swiftly by the fighters. Now some of the old favourites have been rebuilt using the new technology.
<br />
<br />But with the good there is always bad, the increased survive ability of trading with the large cargo holds of the freighter fighters, has seen an increase in the sale of prisoners. While this trade is not legal none will put a stop to it as it is resolving the overcrowding problems in prisons.
<br />
<br />The law enforcement factions are not having it easy as every one has better equipped and more agile ships. This is why there is an increase in the amount of missions being offered to Freelancers, the increased pay out&#8217;s reflecting the increased danger.
<br />
<br />As the routs to new systems slowly gets out to the general populous, there is increasing contact and conflict with new races. The effect of this being more and more groups forming their own factions. The most notable at the moment is the GS Clan. Being of a religiously fanatical nature, and some say they have mystical powers they are now a force to be reckoned with. Having developed their own ships and employed the best robot pilots for patrols and general security, they successfully took control of a system. For those who are able to pay the passage rates, using this system as a short cut saves time and expense for trading.
<br />
<br /><b>Part of a leaked review by the Liberty Security Council.   </b>
<br />
<br />After the 10 year ship sales war, which cost millions of lives and was the end of many companies the peace treaty signed by all factions is slowly taking effect. Most bases have now been assigned the sales rights to at least one ship, and the controlling consortium has been forced to pick up the pace of allocating a further 100 ships.
<br />
<br />At time of going to press a private company was cataloguing the allocated ships and where they are sold. This can be accessed through your neuro net the address is <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dogfightmod.com">www.dogfightmod.com</a><!-- w -->

<br />New Update Mod System
<br />This is an ongoing mod build and as the file size is growing the upload and download times are getting silly, to solve this GS Studios has invested in a program to enable all further releases to be installed as updates. It is totally automated, all you have to do is deactivate the mod in FLMM, point it to your FLMM if not in C: drive and set it going then reactivate the mod in FLMM. This will also enable us to bring out new stuff more often as file sizes will be under 1 mb.
