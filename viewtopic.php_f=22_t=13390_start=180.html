<br />
<br />I got waaaaaaaay to excited and forgot my basic promise and the reason I created HRE.  No Piracy, No Taxation.  HRE will be changing it's stance to better mirror that position... Gonna hold some events though, and I need to raise some capital wquick, got a route.... well, we'll see.
<br />
<br />I respect what you are saying, and your opinion.  It hasn't been said, but there is a council of the clans, and the first thing we are doing is setting up a system to ensure that the FREELANCER, clan affiliated or not, is protected to have all the fun it wants.  Personally, to Sasha, I enjoy a good hunt, and had I not been on business earlier, I would have blown you from the skies since you are a pirate.
<br />
<br />In kusari we will have laws.  The laws are their to hopefully entice ppl to try and get away with breaking them, creating a whole new dimension to an awesome game on an awesome server.  I will be allowing players to post bounties on other players.  I amy even find an excuse to start a war - who knows.  All told, I have 4 active characters, and only one is in a clan, one is a known criminal, and 2 are neutral to all... what good would I do to ruin the fun for myself, let alone everyone else.
<br />
<br />I apologize if I offended you.  I didnt mean to.  See you on the server.
<br />
<br />Firestorm

<br />Pirates, Government Agent, and Criminals...we like you all...just don't get in our crosshairs!</div>

<br />Firestorm, think fines, fines for speeding too close to a dock, fines for firing weapons in a no fire zone i.e. near a dock, fines for firing on anyone in controlled space. Fines for smugling cardimine or artifacts.
<br /> Let the wheels of bureaucracy roll, LOL.
<br /> Or host contests, pvp duelling, racing, stuff that's already been on browclops, but do it more locally, here's the thing, charge an entry fee to all contestants, winner takes the pot, government skims 10-20% off the top.</div>

			<div class="content">Sasha - I will hazard a guess, only because it sounds like something this General would say, If I am right - keep your creds...if I am wrong....well - it wouldn't be the first time.  Was it General Zhukov?
<br />
<br />Pirate, hunter, looter, noob Killer....hunt me or my clan and become the hunted.  I hope that it si fun, if it stops then we are doing something wrong.  I enjoy the hunt, and look forward to claiming my trophy.
<br />
<br />&quot;Taxes....tolls.....much to be decided. In Kusari, until further decided by HRE Clan council, and unless USB decides to do otherwise, 1/2 of any tax collected goes to the collector. There will be standardized rates for transit in our space. The other half will go into a pot.&quot; - I was wrong to say that when my earlier post was wrong.  HRE may host some pay-to-play events, may offer bounties on different players for whatever reason, it may seek fees for escorting (only if the escort is accepted) and fees for rescue from a pirate - BUT NO DAMN TAXES....
<br />
<br />Mark - keep the ideas coming, Sasha - Don't sing it - Just Bring it!

I personally don't have a single prob about payin a few creds. here and there, but I think like I said the whole principal of contributing creds to random locals is somewhat, unappealing to some people...think that may be an understatment...perhaps we should just turn to our fearless leader and see what he things of the whole tomalley...eh?</div>

			<div class="content">Ok, this message has been a long time in coming. those of u who dont like the &quot;clan fever&quot; that started, u might wanna pay attention. for those who do like it, and arent a part of GOV, take a look, but for u GOV members, read this carefully. as i spoke with many ppl over the last 2 days, i found lots of irritation and some downright hostility toward GOV. dont b fooled any1 who thinks theyre playing me, i know whos on the up, and whos not. from this moment on, GOV is no longer under those policies set forth by reg. we cannot and will not continue on that path. not that i think theyre bad, but too many ppl didnt like them, and they did cause some unnecessary hostility. at the beginning, i hesitated to even call GOV a clan, bc that wasnt the goal at all. when it started, it was just a group of me and my friends/online acquaintances that worked together, could trust each other, and would help each other if some1 stepped on them. 
<br />
<br />things have gone far beyond that. unfortunately, i was not able to speak with regulator before posting this, so sorry for hte surprise dude. i told u i wanted to chat last night, missions or no missions. part of what let the GOV end of things outa control is that reg was on here at lancers alone trying to fight for the integrity of the group, saying that our policies would not b forced on ppl and we are not pretending to have REAL power. i was tryin to manage things from the inside of the game, as well as the fact that i was away from the game for 3 days. i know there might b some hard feelings from this, and i know that there were already, im just hoping this will make less of them and every1 can go back to playin and having fun. if anyone tries to act of their own accord and do something in the name of GOV that falls in teh following category, i WILL kick them out, and possibly have the char with the  GOV tag banned. i will however give them a chance to strip that player down and xfer stuff in most cases, unless they tried to subvert the group.
<br />
<br />these things will get a member KICKED from GOV
<br />taxing
<br />pking n00bs
<br />pking freighters or backshooting EXCESSIVELY despite warnings
<br />not following rules, not being upstanding in events
<br />STARTING WARS
<br />cheating ANYONE, GOV member or not, out of their stuff in a xfer, etc.
<br />
<br />as i spoke with a few ppl last night, and i talked to them about what has happened, without them conferring, we were on private chat, they all said it was my duty to get things under control, cuz i started the clan. so here it is. i dont want to sound too authoritative, i built GOV on the concept of freedom, but some ppl used that too much, and did things that reflect on GOV. heres the bottom line. GOV was started to allow ppl to be stronger. as the lamo acronym goes, T-E-A-M
<br />Together
<br />Everyone
<br />Acheives
<br />More
<br />
<br />so from now on, we just work together. a few GOV members may not be with us anymore for one of two reasons, a) they dont likethe news, b) they get kicked for &quot;treason&quot; or destroying GOVs reputation.
<br />GOV will now begin to go back to the foundations
<br />help n00bs
<br />help each other
<br />HAVE FUN
<br />dont get in any other players way in having fun.
<br />support other members when needed, and then all players as well
<br />
<br />we will no longer be identified as a clan. we no longer have a seat in the council related to territory. i hope brow will allow me to be in it as a neutral unaffiliated member that can help others accomplish the main goal, which, since this is only a computer game, HAVE SOME FUN.
<br />
<br />all members, pls, whichever char ur using at any time, GOV tagged or not, live up to the rules, honor, and policy that we were built to accomplish. i had a few members complain that they didnt feel like ppl were following the same things if they were in their untagged players. the only reason i wanted a tag in the first place was to allow all players on the server to see it and know, ok, theres a guy (or girl of course, we have a few of them too, thankfully) that can be trusted. ppl on here trust me, or at least they did. i hope this clan thing gettin outa hand doesnt make ppl think that was me jumpin for power. it wasnt. i want ppl to have trust for our members, so follow the Golden Rule pls.
<br />
<br />ok guys, this is freakin long enuf already, so peace out. have fun and keep it clean

			<div class="content">I am waiting on Regulator's response to what Bits/Crusader has to say before I decide what HRE is going to do.
<br />
<br />Bits, by simply existing, having a member base that uses your tag [GOV you are a clan.  Sociologists have done countless studies of the subject, and the overwhelming conclusion is that most people want to belong to something bigger than themselves.  Proof is on the server.  No one knows anyone outside of the server, that is in the real world, yet still everyone manages and strives to make the game more fun, more challenging, more competitive, basically more entertaining for everyone involved. If that was not the case, then why even bother connecting online - simply play in single player mode.
<br />
<br />The purpose of the &quot;clan council&quot; and dividing the sectors online was to provide variety to the playing experience on browclops.  I think everyone, myself included, lost sight of that.  The game could have a whole new element, a whole new subplot, if there were intrigues, wars, games, etc beyond what the program provides.  Like it or lump it, by having characters on the server with the tag [GOV or {HRE} or {AR} or [SD or Russian_Mafia or any other that I may have missed, you are power - the power of community, the power of safety through numbers, the power of association.
<br />
<br />One power, one source of anything is a monopoly.  Monopolies are bad - otherwise Microsoft, AT&amp;T, and several others would not have been broken up.  By withdrawing a your support of the Clan Council by [GOV Membership, you simply deny those members a voice in how it will be played, and how they can be affected.  If you still feel that way, the name of the game still applies - FREELANCER.  You get to make your choice.  Other players get to do so as well.
<br />
<br />I am rambling now, so I should probably stop.  GOV is still a power, and if they choose not to have a voice, that is their choice.
<br />
<br />Let me know.  I would also enjoy hearing what others, Clan or no, have to say about it.

			<div class="content">not to argue, but i think i said, and i know i meant that if i get a voice in the council without it being from GOV, instead as a neutral contributor, being a police of this server, then they would still have representation thats better. they wouldnt have it as their representation, instead it would b of all non-clan member and themselves that i would represent. and that was just a possibility. for now, i remain in charge of GOV and its direction, so as to appease those non role player fans such as default, raptor, etc.....who dont seem to b happy with what i started. ill b bringing its role down per their unspoken demand, one only received thru implication and the grapevine. further, regardless of what path things take, i m in support of GOV being represented in teh council, just no differently than the rest of ppl on this server. i dont want ppl to feel like they need to b part of a clan to b safe, or to b represented. thus, the issue is settled, i am in support of the council, always was, guess it just wasnt clear.</div>

			<div class="content">Bits, you and I are seeing and saying the same things, I think, but misunderstanding eachother.  A couple questions to clarify - 
<br />
<br />Is [GOV purporting itself to be the de facto &quot;police force&quot; for all sectors on the server?  Remember from earlier, HRE does not, will not, recognize your claim to enforce your rules in our space. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />What is it that you are trying to accomplish that we are not accomplishing, would like to see accomplished...How can we make the server better all around?
<br />
<br />I still have a copy of the notes from the so called Clan Council, and if you send a blank email to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:hre_firestorm@yahoo.com">hre_firestorm@yahoo.com</a><!-- e -->, i will reply with a copy of the notes.  One of the basic things that was set up, that all the members of the council agreed to was that the server should be policed.  Individual clans claimed certain sectors to police them themselves - the amount of territory is simply too huge for one group to do it.  To see how HRE currently plans to police Kusari, visit our under-construction website at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/clan_hre">http://www.freewebs.com/clan_hre</a><!-- m -->.  By having several clans police several sectors, we hope to add a distinct flavor to the match.  The driving idea is to make it as fun as possible.  The reason one representative has been asked to attend from each clan is to have one point of contact to make sure that everyone participating is informed.  If your group is a democratic group, then the rep should have an idea of what he can or cannot agree to before the vote is made.  There is nothing wrong in saying the clan needs to decide.  Finally, and personally, I find out that any clan is abusing it's position to &quot;lean&quot; on players, &quot;intimidate&quot; them into joining or face being run out by the rest of the clan, then HRE will go to war with that clan.  We are the little guy here, we live and die for the little guy.
<br />
<br />As a test run, I will be offering FREE escorts to anyone inside Kusari space and will INSURE your cargo against NPCs and PKs for the value of replacement.  I really think I can handle that part...lol - one freighter at a time.  These creds to replace a loss will come out of my pocket.  I will figure out how to place a value on cargo...but that is my responsibility.
<br />
<br />Still waiting on Regulator's response....
<br />
<br />Pirates, Government Agent, and Criminals...we like you all...just don't get in our crosshairs!</div>
