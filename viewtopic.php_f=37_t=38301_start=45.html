			<div class="content">Prof. Quasar-Space Guru,
<br />
<br />Many thanks .. I dont know what to say.. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src=smilies/icon_smile_cool.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>...
<br />
<br />The E-mod championships sounds cool.. I wonder if it could be set up where you progressed through all the AI including Epsilon factions based on degree of difficulty, with the highest rankings going to the least killed player.., then the best come together in equal'ish ships for a tad of PVP... on levels of ships rankings...very cool idea.. now if we can get someone to host it and do all the recording... plus establish some rules.. this could be a very fun interesting contest... shades of the 'old days'  lol
<br />
<br />It is my intention to continue with modelling.. being a long-time sci-fi fan I always marvelled at the ships I saw, and wanted to create them or similar, and as a kid would spend much of my time in art class doing elevations of sports cars and aircraft (not what i was supposed to be doing at all)...lol. 
<br />I agree form should follow funtion and if my models dont all fit it is because I want to experiment and learn about the differences and limitations between what I see in my minds eye and what appears in Milkshape... People say its limited and if I want to really progress then I must use other modelling programs like max, lightwave, bryce, etc.. yet I feel that one needs to fully understand the basics and to achieve the desired results without a zillion polys. I look more and more to nature now for shapes..  as technology has, and have never been a fan of models that were a collection of boxes on sticks, yet I love assymetrical designs. Take a look at the Hekken... its based on a horseshoe crab... simple yet efficient and untroubled by evolution for millions of years, the same animal exists today as almost a million years ago.. and its not onlt hydrodynamically efficient, recent experiments have shown that it's also aerodynamically efficient.. goes to show ya really.. a million+ years old..
<br />
<br />While space does not care what sort of shape presents itself, atmosphere does, now we assume that freelancer ships can move in atmosphere so my feeling is that given man's perchant for efficient shapes why he would not build them to offer less resistance to atmosphere?.. Aspect ratio is used on many modern aircraft designs and it allows (with some exceptions) better shapes, more eyepleasing, more efficient, to be manufactured. With future advances who know what can be supported... I personally think the result will be well beyond our imaginings... now..<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I never seem to be able to create models as fast as I can imagine them thoough so I'll hasten slowly, and look at what the masters of this genre do, until I can create the ships I have in my head.. (man what a rave... <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) However modelling is like a addiction I enjoy.. It took someone else to point out that 90% of the job is a texture.. and many modellers do not realise this - I didnt , but hope I do now.
<br />
<br />We have an excellent team: Parabolix is fantastic on things equipment and weapons, and when he does it.. modelling, Buck Danny is a primo Coder par excellence, Darky another excellent coder but increasingly our friend on the servers.. he finds servers and does excellent PR.. Veral just gets better and better with .thn files, JustSomeGuy is great on detailing systems..
<br />
<br />We welcome modellers that can provide original ship concepts and I have some really nice original models by both Firebase and Major Striker awaiting 'stuff' to get them into the game.. plus a couple of other potentials that need a little &quot;refinement&quot; .. time is my enemy.. when it come to texturing.. problem is very few modellers take the time to learn it well.
<br />
<br />If there are those out in TLR land who feel they have the time and effort to help out then we welcome it.. drop us an email.. previous requests have met with zero replies.
<br />
<br />There are genius's who frequent TLR and the idea of creating FL-TLR or TLR-FL is something we as a community could actively work towards.. problem is someone has to be the 'co-ordinator' and talent has a tendency not to get on..Humility is not a default of the talented...
<br />
<br />Ok... to your questions..
<br />
<br />The admin system is in SP only because it was easier to make 1 mod than 2.. currently it is &quot;turned off until we can develop it further&quot; it is normally only availbale to the server staff. BS Bobway is in the admin system. The Snare-9 has the quicksilver guns and turret .. the only way to get them is to buy a Snare-9 which comes with 4 quicksilvers and 2 quicksilver quad turrets.. and no shield worth a damn... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_shock.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Ohh and btw all.. all the uber ships are gunna cost more, be harder to find, plus level and REPUTATION based... Oh No!.. I hear? .. Suffer.. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> This includes all ships above level 7... they WILL not be in Liberty .. 
<br />
<br />Argh,
<br />
<br />We should talk .. do you use msn?
<br />
<br />I assume you were talking about the previous poster, not asking us to review? I have a problem, I dont understand xml, I can 'see'  things in 3d in my head, turn them, develop them, design things and 'see' in my mind what I want..yet xml is all gobbledegook to me. I'm particulraly interested in lighting and translucency in textures and looking at your tanker I see you are too.. this is an area that has never really been explored and I am fairly sure (95% anyway) that the nomad textures are based on two levels; a base non illuminated texture, and a top translucent yet 'self' illuminated texture.. I have made some progress in this area, but maybe we could compare notes? Anton also has some clues on this..

			<div class="content">Dear Harrier,
<br />
<br />While  sitting now in the airplane, I take the time to write you just a few words:
<br />You are in fact wondering, why I choose this particular forum to post my appeal.
<br />The answer is, you are simply among the best, most original, commited, serious, creative spirit of design among  the most talented ones in TLR. This is a fact, no compliment.
<br />
<br />if you were my university student, you would definitely receive a scholarship to promote your sincereness, skills, ethical virtues, together with some basics in administrative management.
<br />
<br />Remember: You can not surf on a toothpick. Only strong roots can support and nurish a big tree. Without them all the height is meaningless.
<br />
<br />Humility SHOULD play a keyrole among you all, otherwise you are worth your fate.
<br />Cesar&#180;s wellknown &quot;devide and rule&quot; would then perfectly demonstrate how to keep
<br />a community weaker and smaller, without perspectives...
<br />
<br />Therefore I am willing Harrier, to allow you to post the most important parts (according to you ofcourse) of my article not only in this forum, but on the main front page of TLR, in order to wake the sleep giant up, and inject blood to his brains... I modified it a bit so it is OK now as it is.
<br />
<br />It is time for some unifing action here, as for coordinators, responsibility can be an antidote to humility, a positive one if you handle it properly...People who want to pursue their individual Mods will stop doing so, if they understand that the WHOLE is more brilliant than the PART. And there are so many things they too could contribute to the cause...
<br />
<br />Remember: All for one and one for all.
<br />
<br />We should land in a couple of hours so I have to close now. By the way thank you for your answer regarding the Admin System and equipment. My nephew was very pleased.
<br />Take good care of yourself. We need man like you outhere...
<br />My regards and respect to the Nova Team
<br />
<br />Yours sincerely
<br />Prof. Quasar-Space Guru

			<div class="content">Hey guys. I just read all of the posts above this one, and I have one thing to say...
<br />
<br />Dudes... YOU ROCK!!!
<br />
<br />I am, or used to be, into sci-fi ships in a big way. Whenever I have nothing better to do (i.e. most of the time), I draw them. I'm working on one right now, in fact.
<br />
<br />So far It looks like something out of Star Trek, but with a few subtle changes that probably nop one will notice unless they are familiar with the series.
<br />
<br />Length: Aprox. 1680 ft.
<br />
<br />Beam: Approx. 576 ft.
<br />
<br />Height: Approx. 288 ft.
<br />
<br />Okay... so I went a little overboard on the dementions, but that was only because of the extremely complex shape of this one.
<br />
<br />Anyway, even though I can only work on ink and paper (1/4 inch graph paper to be exact) and my drawings take weeks to finish (losta rough drafts), Is there any room for someone like me with y'all, or with any of the mod teams?</div>

			<div class="content">Dear Harrier, dear Parabolix,
<br />
<br />On behalf of my nephew I must report, that it will definitely take some amount of time for him to develop ace leader pilot skills, in order to afford the fearfull, outstanding, lethal equipment I mentioned above. 
<br />Nevertheless I decided  to stop helping him further, untill he proves that he is worth it showing considerable progress. 
<br />Practice needs improvement. Patience needs endurance as it is a virtue of the wise. Any objections Harrier ? Should I continue to help him ?
<br />
<br />Parabolix, the weapons effects and sounds are original, destructive and well thought indeed. I could mention here my favorites, ( ABSOLUTE effective...) nevertheless it shouldn&#180;t be my intention here to show the best combinations of ship-equipment to everyone, should I...<img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />It is more than obvious, you spend serious time to develop them, therefore please
<br />accept my congratulations for your work. Allow me to mention this though:
<br />
<br />People who play such a game, irrespective their age, are sitting hours in front of monitors. You might consider also, that most of them have nowadays TFT-LCD
<br />monitors which have very high contrast and brightness rates. And not everyone 
<br />knows how to deal with them properly, unfortunately.
<br />
<br />From a medical, neurophysiological point of view perhaps you might consider, that the weapon flashes with a big radius (especially in a high frequency), can get very stressfull for the eyes. This stress goes directly into the brain cells with serious possible complications. Especially the bright white flash lights  in the dark space backround. 
<br />
<br />I am sure you are able to solve this issue without minimize the effect.
<br />Use colours for the big flashes which are relaxing for the optical nerve like green, blue, egg-yellow, dark red (bordeaux) in different colour-tones variations. Avoid the white, brilliant colour spectre for large effects.
<br />
<br />In your Mod there is ONE ship- equipment combination which outruns every other
<br />in any other Mod in the whole galaxy...I wish everyone good luck by searching !
<br />(No capitals). To find it though, you have to go through frustration, torture and DEATHS. This is THE DEATH MOD par excellance ! Nevertheless the reward is absolute DEVASTATING...
<br />
<br />Yours sincerely
<br />Prof. Quasar-Space Guru

			<div class="content">Otay, I figure da MOD is rite well complete. Howsomeever, there was a suggestion I wanted to tender. Been using Silent Runner freighter {to build up credits; good cargo hold} but there is a slight improvement required. It has to do with the BATS. It only carries 48. They are used in ONE, count them 1, recharge. It would be nice to have more, 'bout 5 times as many would probably be more reasonable. With only 1 recharge it requires runnin' from a fair dinkum number of encouters of the unfriendly kind; especially Elementals. {Yes, still working on acquiring better bang-bang that would assist.}
<br />
<br />Tanks for listening &amp; all da fine effort/work.
<br />
<br />{{Found this same issue w/Warlord. Odd thing is for both it only takes a few nannos to repair. Once in SR was down to like 2 squares &amp; did not take but about 8 to full repair - not sure was fighting.}
