			<div class="content">After naming my mod New Universe I realized that Frost-Works had a mod by the same name. My Freelancer: New Universe mod has been renamed to 'Coalition Encounter'.
<br />
<br />Here is the complete storyline.
<br />
<br />It has been 3 years since the brief war started by the Nomads. After radical changes in its government, Rhineland was allowed to have a military. It quickly built up and has the second largest fleet, behind Bretonia. Kusari was rebuilt and also has a large fleet. Liberty's fleet is smallest, however, with recent upgrades, is hard-striking and very efficient.
<br />
<br />The new house of Hispania has been formed from the unification of the Corsairs and Outcasts. The new government faces tough problems, such as violence between former Corsairs and former Outcasts, the newly banned Cardamine, and Nomads.
<br />
<br />Nomad lands have been found to be smaller than originally thought. Nomads only live to the northeast of Omicron Gamma. With the joint-funded Sirius Wall, a string of defenses, the Nomads are at bay for now.
<br />
<br />There have been new advancements. A new capital ship, the Carrier, has dethroned the Battleship as the biggest asset of a navy. Interceptor ships, fast, sleek, and designed for the confines of a carrier, exist as a nice alternative to a light fighter. Swarms of Light Bombers, cousin of the Heavy Fighter, are the capital ship's worst nightmare. And the Heavy Bomber, a Gunship coverted to fire torpedoes, can be devastating to a naval fleet.
<br />
<br />But all is not well.
<br />
<br />First of all, the anti-matter bomb is deadlier than ever. Small anti-matter bombs, capable of destroying a space station, have existed for a while. Slightly bigger anti-matter releases have been caused by accidents. But for the first time, anti-matter weapons capable of destroying an entire sector, such as Manhattan or New Tokyo, were developed by two Kusari physicists. These weapons have not even been tested, and to ensure that no House can dominate all the others, an order to fire an anti-matter weapon must be authorized by two other houses.
<br />
<br />Secondly, and worse, joint-House expedition was led that went east of Omicron Gamma and out of the Sirius sector. Led by the RNC Bismarck, the largest Battleship in Rhineland's fleet, the expedition was nearly destroyed by the natives. The natives that they found shocked every person in Sirius.
<br />
<br />The Coalition was there.
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />France and Italy were the biggest losers in the Alliance-Coalition war. They chose not to leave Sol, and paid dearly. They both had to surrender to the winning powers. They were not annexed, but lived on as prisoner states. The French were under the control of Russia, the Italians were under the control of China.
<br />
<br />Then aliens came. The Coalition was almost defeated when it copied the Alliance and launched Sleeper Ships. Moskva had the Russians. Beijing had the Chinese.  Mecca-Jerusalem had the Middle Eastern people. Italy and France were granted a Sleeper Ship each, which they named Paris and Roma.
<br />
<br />They landed just outside the Sirius sector. Without making contact with the Alliance Houses, they, too, grew and prospered, except for Paris and Roma. 
<br />
<br />Once they made contact for the first time in centuries, war broke out again, deadlier than ever.</div>

			<div class="content">Sounds pretty cool, but Rheinland has always been allowed to have a fleet, but they had lost it in the 80yrs War with GMG. Also, i think that Liberty should have the largest fleet. Recent history has shown that Britian has had a less than great fleet. Kusari should have third largest fleet and Rheinland should stay second. About the Coalition, they shouldnt have all out war right off the bat...maybe the Bismarck is seen as an intruder, not as an old enemy. Something should happen, not just have war because they are old enemies. When exploring the new sectors you should be told the story of what happened to Sol. That's about all i have for now.</div>

In the opening sequence to FL it is said &quot;We will never forget&quot;, meaning ALL of the colonies always kept the memories of the exodus and the coalition, once the Bismark would confirm the presence they encountered to be Coalition, they would open fire on everything in site.</div>

			<div class="content">Don't forget, the Coalition would have developed thier own tech along thier own tech tree.  Therefore Coalition ships, planets, bases, weapons, etc. would have thier own distinct look to them.  And remember, war accelerates tech advances.
<br />The Alliance would not have known the Coalition was coming, but the Coalition would have known the Alliance was already there.  Can you say spyships, superguns, and portable tradelanes/jumpgates oh my!</div>

			<div class="content">1) &quot;We will never forget.&quot; does not mean &quot;We will act like complete idiots and open fire of the first Coalition ship or installation we see without learning first if the Coalition as a whole outguns, out techs, and out numbers us which they probably do given that they started out with a bigger population, an intact industrial base, and didn't sleep a few decades or centuries away.&quot;
<br />
<br />In the context of Freelancer, every resident knows about the Coalition and sleeper ships from grade school. But that was 800 years ago and any grudges have died in the meantime as current events become more pressing concerns.
<br />
<br />Ditto for the Coalition.
<br />
<br />2) I simply don't see the Corsairs and Outcasts uniting. The two have been feuding for nearly 800 years, with mutual hatred kept alive by sniping at each other. Plus, they're on opposite sides of the Sector to boot.
<br />
<br />3) Rheinland is allowed to have a fleet. But after the last couple of wars, it can't afford one anymore. Heck, Rheinland can barely afford to have police!
<br />
<br />4) Antimatter? Who the heck uses antimatter in this game?
<br />
<br />My ideas for a Coalition campaign.
<br />
<br />a) The Order runs into the Coalition while exploring the Dom Kovash hypergate network.
<br />
<br />b) Trent (the player) is sent to infiltrate by doing what he does best: Freelancing (the Coalition has pilots for hire to).
<br />
<br />c) While freelancing, Trent learns about what happened to the Coalition since the Sleeper Ships left and the current politics.
<br />
<br />d) The Coalition is more advanced than Sirius, so Trent can buy more powerful fighters, guns, etc than what is normally found in Sirius.

			<div class="content">Try and put yourself into the shoes of someone in the colonies. Imagine having to be uprooted for your HOMEWORLD, NEVER TO SEE IT AGAIN by a enemy who doesnt even remember or care about the ignorant principles that started that war (try playing StarLancer if you dont know about the alliance/coalition war) and sent to the Sirius sector to make a new life. Now, 8 centuries later you are confronted with that mythic enemy that destroyed your people, and your chance of ever seeing the system your race was born in. In that situation, with either the Kusari or Rhinelanders war would be inevitable. The Kusari would blast the Coal's as a matter of honor, the old Japanese honor codes amplified by eight centuries demands it and the Rhinelanders German pride that led the war's Rhineland suffered also would push for them to open up on the Coalition.
<br />
<br />And no, the Coalition would not be uber advanced and its ignorant to even think that. They would be on a equal level as the Colonies, the fact the Nomads would push them to make sleepers PROVES that point.</div>

			<div class="content">Not realy Toco, see at the nomads like on pitbulls... any little weak girl can have a big dangerous dog that is guarding her puppy. Actualy noone know anything about the dom kovash, they could be very agressive, but they could also be very peaceful and need someone who is agressive enough to protect them (the nomads), it see it pretty like StarTrek DS9... the race of Odo (sorry no idea whats the name for them in english) is quite preacefull, maybe a bit upset regarding how the humanoids are treatening them, but no warriors, so they made themselves a new warrior-like race, the Jem&#180;Hadar .
<br />
<br />As for coalition tech... it could also be, that Sirius is way more advanced, as they latest 800 years are filled with conflicts and to surive at all. THe necessity of things and especialy warlike conflicts highly increase humans ability to develop new technologies, coalition could have a civil war, but most likely not and thus they were stagnat in their tech.
