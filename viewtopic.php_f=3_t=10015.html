			<div class="content">It doesn't make sense to me that in multiplay you can't trade or interact planetside where it is safe. (and where this kind of thing would logically happen in reality) What would be cool is if you could pick from say a dozen different character types at the start and then upload your small pic to the server that gets mapped to the face of your character. Then whenever you enter a bar the computer subsitutes your character for what would be an npc sitting at the table. Talking to someone else would be just a matter of clicking on thier character which opens up a chat/trade dialog.
<br />
<br />A cheap but workable substitute my be a &quot;bulletin board&quot; similar to the job board but where players can leave trade/job requests etc. Or even a simplified aim or icq type list of real players that are in the same bar. You get the point.
<br />
<br />The ability to trade or sell location information like the npc's do. I think it would be cool to make money being a scout selling nav maps. Or scouting with a buddy and meeting in the middle to share results, etc.
<br />
<br />An autopilot that doesn't scrape me across the station to dock at the other door. (Im bestest buddies with every ship painter in sirius by now) Despite being all over I have yet to find an &quot;autopilot level 2&quot; anywhere. Anybody know what system they sell these in, hehe.
<br />
<br />I don't think its fair or real that the reputation of a freighter captains reputation should go DOWN for NOT dropping his cargo. It seems to me it should be the other way around. Or at least, the rep with every shipping company should go UP with every cargo NOT dropped. Would'nt you want to hire a freighter that could get the cargo to its destination?  I also think its bs when you get mugged by pirates right out of dock, refuse to dump, and the station goes red.
<br />
<br />There should have been available for puchase upgrade a cargo/nav computer that would store, collate, and allow easy access to gathered data. They really dropped the ball on this one. You know this is true when a couple of weeks after release some enterprising souls have written this code THEMSELVES!
<br />
<br />Makes me wonder if they (DA-MS) really talked to anyone who plays this type of game. Or just counted on the fact that most of us are psycotic and would buy it anyway. Hey, Iam, I did, and I know Iam not alone <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I know this is far fetched, but... The ability to buy a station that you could load up with your own loot and open up shop, equipment dealer, commodity broker, etc. This would probably be out in a border world somewhere and cost say 30 million credits+upgrades? The ability to have more than one ship at this point would be cool as well. 
<br />
<br />The ability to upload a ship/faction logo that appears on your ship in game.
<br />
<br />More systems outside the border worlds, undiscovered, even randomised at server start, with the ability to build or buy jumpgates and tradelanes to them.
<br />
<br />A mining ship for purchase (kind of like a slow freighter, but with a lot of lower power auto-turrets) So you could just pull into the belt and your turrets would target and shoot any moving rock in the immediate area. Or a ship that scans, and mines the bigger astroids with a special mining beam.
<br />
<br />Cargo missions , convoy escort missions, spy missions, blockade missions.
<br />
<br />Not losing so much money selling ships and equipment. It makes ZERO sense that you should lose money selling a weapon that is a higher level than anything available in that system. Ie you should be able to make a mint selling level 7+ guns in liberty, kusari, etc.
<br />
<br />I like the fact that they included multiplayer in this type of game. But I'm still waiting for the next &quot;classic&quot; that could be. I would like to see an EoC space engine tied to a battlefield1942 style fps engine for planetside and an overhead/navmap/tactical/cargo computer to link it all together.
<br />
<br />Kind of like a 3d version of Sundog. (Turn on the way back machine) Land on a planet rent a car or take a tram to the commodity broker, bank, bar, or equipment dealer. Don't walk through the seedy part of town or you might get mugged. You could have missions that involve ground based objectives as well as space based. Basically it could work the same way the docking sequences do now except that the player gets handed over to the &quot;fps&quot; engine upon docking with a planet or a base.
<br />
<br />It seems to me all the elements exist to make the greatest space-sim-trader-adventure-game ever, they just need to put them together in a novel way.
<br />

			<div class="content">I think all of your ideas are pretty good. But the one I would most like to see is the one where you get to have your own station. That would be sweet. You could have more than one ship and store your loot. It would also be cool if when you got enought cargo you could open up shop and sell goods and buy them. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
