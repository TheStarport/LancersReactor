<br />FREELANCER EXPLAINED
<br />
<br />(In rebuttal to <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=27129&amp;forum_id=3&amp;Topic_Title=Freelancer%2D+The+%26quot%3BUNREAL%26quot%3B+Parts%2E%2E%2E&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Discussion&amp;cat_title=Freelancer&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank>this</a> thread.
<br />
<br />1. Thrust
<br />
<br />Ship engines in Freelancer work under the principle of fusion propulsion, which goes a liddle bit like a'this:
<br />To start off the fusion reactor, MOX, a refined fission trigger, is used. (More on this <a href='http://people.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-bomb6.htm' Target=_Blank>here</a>)Once the fusion reaction has been catalysed, it does not need to be shut off until docking or landing procedures. To move in space, superheated fusion energy is sent in a small &quot;packet burst,&quot; pushing the vessel forward in space.
<br />
<br />A &quot;packet burst&quot; is essentially a small amount of the fusion energy ejected out the back of the engine module, providing force, and thus pushing the ship forward. Using electromagnetism, a pilot can control the size/force of the packet bursts.

<br />2. Tradelanes
<br />
<br />Tradelanes allow superluminal, or faster-than-light travel by means of space compression. Each ring houses a small generator that emits graviton particles. How is this possible you ask?
<br />
<br />Graviton theory states that graviton particles, subatomic particles that produce gravitic force, are present on all atoms; thusly, all mass has gravity. By using high-energy fusion, at which point fusing the two atoms together fast enough to prevent graviton dissipation, a fusion generator can selectively control its own gravity. 
<br />
<br />Instead of speeding your ship up, each tradelane ring instead uses graviton-assisted space compression to shorten the distance. However, due to the nature of controlled space compression, each ring can only face one direction, hence the need for two rings, stacked.
<br />
<br />3. Jumpgates/holes
<br />
<br />Are jumpgates black holes?
<br />Certainly not!
<br />
<br />Black hole theory: (again!)
<br />
<br />If you look upon space as a massive plane, you are partially correct in your views. However, space is not as flat as you think it is. Gravity dislocation from stars and other astral bodies creates plateaus, hills, and pits in the fabric of space. It has already been proven that this has effects on light; light &quot;bends&quot; and &quot;warps&quot; when it gets close to some spatial body. 
<br />
<br />A star burns by converting hydrogen gas into helium-3 using the process of fusion, creating energy by merging the nuclei of atoms. However abundant, though, hydrogen is not limitless, and the star will eventually run out. To compensate for the loss of hydrogen, the star will expand, and thin out to regulate the lost energy. This has the added side effect of creating more gravity. (more mass=more gravity) When the star completely runs out of hydrogen, it can do one of several things, all of which result from the final collapse of the star due to it's own gravity. 
<br />
<br />1. If it's &quot;lucky,&quot; it may still have enough hydrogen around to collapse into a smaller star and start the process again.
<br />
<br />2. If there's another star around, it may be absorbed into the higher-energy star; at which point, the new star could:
<br />A: become a new, self-sustaining giant star
<br />or
<br />B: redistribute the energy back into a twin star system, until it becomes a really impressive-looking double nova.
<br />
<br />3. It will completely collapse, resulting in a catastrophic amount of gravity dislocation.
<br />
<br />On a map of space time, astral bodies such as stars will appear as small &quot;pits&quot; or &quot;hills&quot; in the plane, due to their gravity dislocation. Once a star collapses, it has a small chance that the collapse, due to the star's previous mass, will not stop its implosion, resulting in a rather large dent in the fabric of space. (Notice how I don't use the phrase &quot;space-time.&quot; I'll get to that later.) This is your average black hole, or more correctly labeled, a &quot;black dent.&quot; This utter mass has such gravitational force that it literally drags in space around it. (Remember the dent?) Not only space, but most objects around it, including light. (Hence the &quot;black&quot; in a black hole)
<br />
<br />The gravity dislocation from a collapsing star could also become several other things which I am too tired to list right now. Maybe later, in another essay.
<br />
<br />But wait! How come PMM never uses that old term &quot;space-time?&quot; Recall the image of the plane with bumps and pits, used to model space. However, since that only depicts universal force, it cannot measure time. Time is something we have created to depict the linearality of eventuality. Time is only how we model the passing of things, and in terms of universality, time is completely immeasurable. The fabric of space is littered with all kinds of imperfections caused by the four universal forces. (Strong and weak nuclear force, elecromagnetic force, and gravitational force) Since none of these four can affect time, an abstract notion conjured up by man, time can no longer fit into the equation.
<br />
<br />Also, light has mass, though very minute. This is due to one thing that most physists have observed: remember how I told you that light bends around the dents and bumps caused by gravity dislocation? According to gravity/graviton theory, all things with mass, due to the presence of graviton particles, (Subatomic particles that have been theorized to create gravity on things with mass, ie: atoms.) are attracted to each other, and are all duly affected by the force of gravity. In the same way, most scientists and I have observed that light does not always travel in wavemotion, such as energy, but as something with mass. Recently, several scientists succeeded in slowing down light to about 25.4 mph, reinforcing this theory.
<br />
<br />Wormholes aren't much different, since a &quot;wormhole&quot; is only two black dents connected to each other due to gravity dislocation.
<br />
<br />So how can I explain jumpgates/holes? Simple: Space compression.
<br />
<br />Jump holes are naturally occuring phenomena that exist simultaneously at two points in space. Runoff energy from a star, when combined with the miraculous nubulaic substances, can create a focused graviton compressor, much more powerful than any conventional tradelane. Obviously, though, it needs a target on the other side, hence the great need for &quot;phase-alignment&quot; (where each jumphole has a companion hole) This is why most jumpholes are located in nubulae, or space clouds.
<br />
<br />Ageira researched space compression technology enough to create their own massive portals, the jumpgates. A jumpgate is basically a mechanized and controlled version of a jumphole. Which leads us to...
<br />
<br />4. The infamous &quot;Texas incident&quot;
<br />
<br />In it's early pioneer days, Ageira tech. wanted to build a jumpgate system to Kusari, directly from Texas, for some reason or another. However, the jumpgate's path intersected a dark matter cloud, such as the ones in Kepler. Due to the nature of space compression, (shortening distance) this caused a catastrophic backlash when it was first tested; the test ship was vaporized, and the jumpgate surged back into itself. The reactor exploded, gravitons were released, and dark matter surged into Texas.
<br />
<br />Today, the &quot;Dallas&quot; field consists of a massive cloud of radiation, (MOX trigger waste) two dark matter clouds, debris, and several resulting jumpholes.
<br />
<br />5. Docking rings
<br />
<br />Mankind always loves to use its toys, so Ageira used space compression technology to ease the escape velocity of ships by creating space &quot;elevators,&quot; the docking rings. Each docking ring uses a space compression tube to a designated target planetside. When the vessel enters the tube, it can land safely on the planet without risking atmospheric burnup. To take off, the vessel only needs to enter the tube on the surface, and the space compression rockets the ship to space with reduced escape thrust.</div>

Becouse gravity known to alter or slow speed light the object inside apears faster for some one who stands outside.

			<div class="content">&quot;To compensate for the loss of hydrogen, the star will expand, and thin out to regulate the lost energy. This has the added side effect of creating more gravity. (more mass=more gravity)&quot;
<br />-- P_M 
<br />
<br />Backing up the train of thought here...
<br />Where is more mass being created? Before you start chatting about black holes maybe we should cover the universal law of gravity.
<br />
<br />While sitting in my chair on the surface of the earth, the earth's gravity acts on my mass, giving me &quot;weight.&quot; This is caused by the earth's mass. If the earth were condensed to the size of the pin but had the same mass, and I was sitting the same distance from it's center, I would still weigh the same. The only thing the density of the mass would effect would be if I was closer to it, ie next to this pin-head of matter I would be crushed.
<br />
<br />You seem to be claiming that as a star burns out, it gets more mass. But that has to come from somewhere. If anything it gets less mass, although not a staggering amount compared to it's total mass.</div>

			<div class="content">Ah_tze is right about this one. If a star is fuseing the hydrogen into helium it isn't gaining or loosing mass by this process. 2nd thermodynamic law would suggests that it might be loosing mass from loss of energy but that would decrease it's gravity not increase it. maybe the helpless planetary bodies and what not being absorbed in the expansion might add to the mass...but I wouldn't think the change would be significant enough to change the outcome.
<br />
<br />also a wormhole created by the &quot;black dent&quot; as you called it cannot be used considering that it would tapper down to submicroscopic levels the naturally occuring wormholes suggested by Mr. Hawkings theories are gigantic cones. you might be able to enter such a wormhole. but you certainly wouldn't ever leave.
<br />
<br />they are working on a theory involving artificial wormholes created useing those little compressed particles that fill space up which I can't remember what they are called dammit......the theory I read was very similar to having more than one black hole to stabalize the wormhole but without the added need of moving gigantic gravity wells around the universe to make one. the idea of moving a blackhole is obviously absurd to begin with. you should probably get that one out of your head.
<br />
<br />also. time. time is not a human invention. the way we measure it may be a human invention but time itself is not. time is a universal property of reality . it effects everything, changes things , it can have predictable and unpredictable effects. and it is ......obviously.....measureable. To say time doesn't really exist is like saying inches don't exist. I would suggest trying to start thinking of space/time in the same light once again......distance without time means nothing, they are directly related.
<br />
<br />edit: I can't BELIEVE I said universal property of the universe my god how redundant.
<br />

			<div class="content">That was my point. Discounting the existance of time is equivalent to discounting the existance of distance. 
<br />
<br />he was going on about speed and acceleration and I challenge anyone to show me any type of real or theoretical expression of speed or acceleration that doesn't include both distance and time.......go ahead.....find anything ....if you can actually come up with a logical expression of speed that doesn't involve time fine I will eat all the crow you have....
<br />
<br />one question...where did you here about light being slowed to 25.4 miles per hour? I'm not doubting the possibility but I've just never heard anything like that before.....it REALLY doesn't seem possible...I'd like to read whatever it was that you read.....
