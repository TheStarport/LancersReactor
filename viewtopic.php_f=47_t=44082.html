			<div class="content">NEWARK STATION, NEW YORK SYSTEM
<br />A bounty hunter. that was what Victor Johnson wanted to be ever since he was a child. Soon he would be one. He was 21, 6.2, weighed 200 pounds, and had 3 thousand credits, and a single room apartment of his own on the station.
<br />Victor walked in the bar, his dark blue jacket matching that of the walls. he quickly slid into a backless chair at the bar counter. &quot;Vic!&quot; called over the his bartender freind, Buster Richey, a well rounded, full-breed-liberty man with a multicolor-stained apron acttually looking kind of cool made his way past another bar patron and rested his elbows onto the the glass bar, lit up below the glass were TV monitors, playing the news, hoverball, Liberty Action Channel, the foreyes, such as Tela-Bretonia, Kusari, Rheinland. Victor got to view a double screen, Liberty Public News, and Hoverball. Victor prayed a pray of thanks to the Lord that he didnt show the zero-gravity gymnastics workout channel. Buster craned his neck around to see from Victor's side to watch hoverball. Victor stared at Buster and cocked a brow. Buster turned around and turned two shades redder. &quot;Hoverball Buster?&quot; &quot;Yea!&quot; he beamed. &quot;I didnt tell you to see if you'd notice!&quot; he raised his eye brows expectantly, still smiling. &quot;Notice what?&quot; i plainly asked. &quot;If you noticed that i lost some weight!&quot; &quot;Oh, yea, come to think of it, looks like you lost a pound or two.&quot; i shrugged and gave a sheepish, sarcastic smile. &quot;Well i'm just getting started!&quot; he threw off the dis. &quot;you see, theres this secretary for the station engineer, and..&quot; &quot;Oh boy! here we go! Buster you havent been on a date in twelve years! Wait!&quot; i interuppted before he said anything &quot;Just give me Stigma Flamer.&quot; &quot;For the last time! We dont have that GMG miner gas miner Naha crud. we have everything else tho, this is a busy base with ships from all round' Sirius, I have a good selection, so just cus' we i dont have one drink your teeded off! we dont get any GMG ships here.&quot; &quot;Fine! Fine! you've made your point, just give an Interspace Itinerary, will ya?&quot; i asked
<br />&quot;That stuff's even worse.&quot; Buster muttered to himself turning around and grabbing a cup shaped like a lower-case I with a cherry floating above as the dot, suspended by and anti-grav lining of the bottom of the cup. He turned around and handed me the Interspace Commerce specialty drink. &quot;5 credits Vic.&quot; i handed him pulled out my neural net card out of my net chrono watch and handed it to him and watched him slide it thru a lining in the bar. &quot;Listen Buster i said in between the disorienting drinks. [because of the anti-grav lining your mouth feels weightless. &quot;Today's the day.&quot; &quot;What's the day?&quot; he asked. &quot;Today's the day I join the Bounty Hunter Guild.&quot; I said. i finished my drinked and sighed with satisfaction. &quot;Thanks Buster.&quot; I slid the drink a couple inches to him and turned around. En route to the table a tough looking Bounty Hunter sat at.
<br />         
<br />          Victor walked up behind the bounty hunter and cleared his throat loud enough for him to hear. &quot;I'm looking to join the Bounty Hunters, you look like an intellignet man.&quot; he said in a big as voice as he could without hinting he was trying to look good. The Hunter sipped his drink and answered without turning around. &quot;Yup, you got some smarts, sid'down, and lemme see ya marker.&quot; Victor pulled out his marker chip from his wrist-neural-net. The man inserted it into a datapad and started stroking his chin, studying his records. &quot;Moved to Newark Station nine months ago,&quot; he mumbled to himself aloud. &quot;Ran convoy protection with some Interspace Convoys from here to Ames resarch up in Kepler.&quot; he stopped stroking his chin. Victor knew what was next. &quot;Says here that, when you were ambushed some Rouges, the transport acting captain who took over when the captain was injured refused to leave for the gate to Colorado, and wanted to stay and fight. You knew he wouldn't last, so u threatened to fire on him if he didnt go. He, being a stubborn, inexperinced noob to the buisness ignored you, you positioned your starflier right by the bridege viewport, and set on of your justices on overload. And that got his attention, no?&quot; he raised his eyebrows expectantly. &quot;Well, uh, yes sir, thats correct.&quot; He turned a couple shades redder. &quot;Well pal, your lucky you came to me, I appreciate that sorts'a thing. Your hired.&quot; Victor beamed. &quot;Equipment room, two hours, im Rick McLausky.&quot; he downed the rest of his drink and started to walk away, only to turn around. &quot;Oh and Mr. Johnson,&quot; he called. &quot;Yea?&quot; &quot;Welcome to the Guild Mr. Johnson.&quot; he turned and walked away.</div>

			<div class="content">Victor walked into the equipment dealer, to see Mclausky standing by a large curtained object. &quot;Ah, Victor, I have a present for you.&quot; he pulled of the curtain &quot;Volia!&quot; he exclaimed, unveiling a Bounty Hunter Piranha Light Fighter &quot;This isnt much compared to the regular Guild ships, like the Barracuda, like mine, or the Hammerhead, but the NY system isnt exzactly the border worlds, even tho your guarnanteed to have your fair share of border world action.
<br />We usussually give these &quot;Piranaha's to new guys, or just those not patroling the most dangerous areas. This ship has everything you need, needler rifles, basic supplies, weapons, and i also did the math from your records, you have 5,000 credits no? Don't answer that son i already know.&quot; he typed in something in his neural net wrist. &quot;Your 10k richer for your starting with the guild.&quot; he said calmly. Victor's mouth dropped invountarily. He managed a thank you, and he told him to be ready for a hunting expedition in one hour. It had begun.</div>

			<div class="content">Victor punched in the formation joining auto-pilot-command and sat back in the pilot's chair. &quot;Alright everyone, this is Victor Johnson, time for introductions, starting from port to starboard formation sides, this is Razor.&quot; &quot;Hey pal welcome to the squadron.&quot; &quot;This is Eddie.&quot; Say Vic, mind if i call you Vic? Sure you don't,&quot; he continued. &quot;Vic have you every heard the one about the Rheinland guy who walks into the bar with a panda bear next to him an orders a sidewinder.....&quot; &quot;Eddie!&quot; McLausky grunted. &quot;Yea?&quot; &quot;Shut up.&quot; &quot;Yes sir.&quot; Rick went thru the rest of the names. Jack, Razor, Connor, Bradley, and Micky. &quot;Alright Fella's were gunna do this pretty easy since Vic is first time on the job. Everybody here has Bounty Commisions for almost all the criminal organizations in Liberty and the surounding Border Worlds. If ya don't know what a Bounty Commision is, its pretty much a contract saying you will be payed for the kill or capture of anyone from so and so, is afiliated with so and so, or has contraband we dont want them to have. I took the liberty of getting you a Commission from the LPI for the Xenos, since they are our next target. This is a quick run. Almost everyday there are attacks at D. Muntions by the Xenos. Today we head there, and wait for them to come to us. Shouldn't be too hard since they dont have the best ships, watch out for their Scorpions tho. Alright, all ships formation check.&quot; McLausky ordered. &quot;This Gold two, in form.&quot; Eddie's voice was heard over the comm, then Jack, Razor, and so on. Alright, entering trade sequnce now, lane passage initiated.&quot; Rick reported. &quot;Alright boys, were goin' in.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">The trip thru the trade lane was uneventful. They arrived on the other side and scanned the area. &quot;Nuthin'&quot; razor dissapointedly reported. Then there was muffling sounds, followed by an mmmmmmmm, and loud smashing. &quot;What the heck is that!?&quot; Rick angrily asked. &quot;Mmmmmm, boy is that stuff geeewwwddd.&quot; &quot;EDDIE!!!!!!!!&quot; Rick screamed over the comm so load that Victor had to turn off the channel for a second. More muffled sounds, then a mettalic thud. &quot;Ah crud! I dropped em!&quot; eddie yelled. &quot;DROPPED WHAT!?&quot; Rick exploded even more angry this time. &quot;The chocolates I picked up in that cool little goodie shop a corridor down from the bar. Milk Chocolate, with a nut coating and caramel goodness center, now if you'll excuse me, i have a 5-second rule to break.&quot; Eddie said told with his mouth full. &quot;EDDIE! PUT THOSE AWAY NOW! WERE GUNNA HAVE SOME XENOS COMIN, AND YOU'L BE EATING!!!!!&quot; &quot;Oh yea, sorry boss.&quot; More muffled sounds, &quot;Okeyday, im ready for those Xenos as anybody can be.&quot;  &quot;Lucky us.&quot; Jack muttered. &quot;Cut the comm noise you two.&quot; Razor and McLausky said at the same time.&quot; They sat there for another hour. And another. &quot;Unkown contacts detected.&quot; the femine computor voice reported, calm as could be.  &quot;This is Detroit Muntions, state your intentions or we will open fire.&quot; &quot;Better start firing.&quot; a gruff colorado voice defided. &quot;The Xenos don't answer to anyone!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Thats them boys! BREAK FORMATION PICK YOUR TARGETS AND ATTACK BOYS!&quot; &quot;YYYEEEEHHHAA!!! LETS GET THIS PARTY STARTED!&quot; Micky's southern texas voice yelled. Rick was in a barrel role at full thrusters right towrads there sqaudrons guns blazing. &quot;Connor!&quot; &quot;Aye sir?&quot; &quot;hit cruise and sneak round their backs, well drop mines right before we crosss paths, those that dont die, blast em'!&quot; &quot;With pleasure sir!&quot; his Kusarian accent replied. Rick told Victor that his real Kusarian name was something like 
<br />Connsuwanzu, after joining the hunters, knowing he'd be leaving Shikoku, changed it to connor. The two sides were heading straight on at each other, like the ancient earth knights during a royal joust. Exept blazing their warriors, gunslinger turrets, and stalker missles, not long poles. The seven bounty hunters quickly destroyed the first wave down from 14 to seven. It was equal now. they got close, the knights poles would have collided now. Sweat violently dripped from Victor bow as Rick gave the order, more like yelled the order, to drop the mines. Their mines tore thru 4 Xenos, like a Sword thru air, the explosions rocked their ships violently. Bradley was thrown forward onto his console and knowcked out cold, right on the cruise aceleration lever. &quot;Bradley, where are you headin'?!&quot; Connor called. Only static answered him. &quot;He's in cruise!&quot; Jack gasped. &quot;He must be knocked out! And he's headin for the debris field!&quot; this happened right as they were tearing thru the xenos ships. &quot;Hey! Wheres Victor?&quot; &quot;Almost outta comm range! Heading in cruise for the debris field. Your gunna get yourself killed! Bradley's almost gone! Get your tail back here now!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Sorry boss! I'm losing your single! ill cya back at Newark!&quot; &quot;VICTOR!!!&quot; only static. &quot;Comon, we cant go after them now.&quot; Rick said, not knowing more to himself or his men. &quot;We need to keep fighting here the next wave will be here any second.
<br />
<br />TO BE CONTINUED!!!!</div>

			<div class="content">Bradly was only 30 seconds from entering to debris field. He would last less then two seconds in there. Victor was trying to gain ground but it was to slow! &quot;TOO DARN SLOW!&quot; he screamed. He did what was one of the most dangerous things to do. He fired his afterburnes and thrusters while in cruise. The ships ****ed around as stars flew by quicker and quicker the ship was breaking up. &quot;Thrusters at 80% left&quot; the computor said so calmly is seemed almost maniacal, even tho Victor knew he had been watching too many Pittsburg horor-holo-films. 15 seconds. he pulled closer. He would have to not be in cruise for him to efectivly tractor him, and Bradly would get away to quickly for that, the tractor would only work for seconds in cruise. Ispiration struck him, he set himself to match course and speed using tractor beam when he told the computor. he loaded up in an EV suit and got on the ship. 7 seconds. It was incredible. No sound. Nothing, just stars flying by. 4seconds. He snapped out of it and hit the engage tractor beam emiter telling the computor to from the outside. 3 seconds. a beam of light  shot by. And matched its course and speed. 2 seconds. Victor fired every thruster on his suit and flung himself thru space. His body was in almost slow motion it seemed, even tho he wasnt. he grabbed his puller magnets and attahed himslef to Bradley's ship's hull with a thud and crash to his head. 1 Second left. He wasnt going to let him and himself die. He grabbed his Detroit &quot;Miami&quot; Magnum Laser pistol . it was already set for wide dispersal. He fired his thrusters to get a 10th of a second gain on the two ships. He fired the pistol. An inch thin sheet of hot red laser vaporized the two ships engines. Time was up. Even tho he didnt feel the g's coming down on him from about 500 to 50 K.p.h. he could tell by the stars stoped moving. The asteroid the ships were going to hit would be thrown off by their thick hull armor. He, had saved both their lives, killed two xenos, captured one, vaporized two ships engines, and saved a new friend's, [and his own life. All in a day's job. It was too good to be true. Litterly. He disobeyed McLausky's orders directly on the very first day. Out of the firefight, and into the most-likely court-martial frying pan. Oh well. He made about ten thousand credits anyway. Wait til' Buster heard about this!</div>

And, Johnson,&quot; that was the first time he called Victor, Johnson. &quot;Stay after the debriefing, were going to have a little chat.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ooooh, somebody's in big trouble.&quot; Eddie muttered a little too loudly.
<br />
<br />WWWWEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!! a laser shot screamed right in front of Eddie's cockpit, a little present from McLausky.
<br />
<br />&quot;Gold Leader, is everything alright out there?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes Ma'am, it was an  accident, i'll try not to do it again.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Whatever you say Gold Leader, Newark out.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If I have to here from that girl one more time...&quot; Rick muttered
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey boss, I wouldn't say that, word is she's going to see if you want to go to Manhatten with her. You don't like her, I know. Do you?&quot; Eddie spoke clearly now.
<br />
<br />By the time Rick turned around to train his weapons on Eddie, he was already docked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Eddie, stay after the debreifing, were going to have a little chit chat.&quot; Rick delighted in his word choice.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;Thats the extent of the breifing.&quot; McLausky finished. &quot;Dismissed.&quot; everyone exept Bradly, and Victor quickly shuffled out of the room.
<br />
<br />&quot;EDDIE!&quot; McLausky grunted. 
<br />
<br />Eddie turned around, his face red. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Your not getting off that easy.&quot;
<br />
<br />Eddie gave a mock snap of the fingers, Connor just turning around real quickly, shrugging his shoulders and raising his eyebrows sheepishly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bradley,&quot; McLausky started. &quot;I don't remember asking you to stay.&quot; said, switching subjects.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well sir, it's just that, well, i-uh, when.. well,&quot; Bradley studdered, whether from embarassment, shame, guilt, or simply not knowing the words to use, Victor couldn't tell.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's alright. You can go home.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhh, thank you sir. Good night.&quot; he blushed, and quickly ran out, Victor fearing he might trip.
<br />
<br />&quot;Eddie,&quot; McLausky sighed. &quot;You can go too.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Boss?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I just wanted to make an expample of you.&quot; Eddie said he understand and tried to leave.
<br />
<br />&quot;One more thing Eddie.&quot; Eddie turned around, a look on his face like a mischevious child caught with a hand in the cookie jar.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yea boss?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;As far as anyone is concerened,&quot; McLausky started. &quot;I really chewed you out in here, and that none of any of them should make the stupid mistake you did.&quot; McLausky folded his arms and raised his eyebrows expectantly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh yea!&quot; Eddie got a lightbulb. &quot;Jees boss, you sure can get angry.&quot; Eddie smiled.
<br />
<br />&quot;Now get outta' here, before I do more than let you start a rumor.&quot; McLausky allowed himself a small grin. Very, very small.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh yea, sure thing boss.&quot; Eddie walked out, uninteruppted. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, looks like it's just us then Victor.&quot;
<br />
<br />Victor didn't know what to say
<br />
<br />&quot;What you did out there today.&quot; Victor looked down. &quot;Was directly disobeying my orders, nearly getting youself killed, saving a wingman, and probably well on your way to a promotion.&quot;
<br />
<br />Victor probably set the universal record of going from shame to beaming quicker than anyone else. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; Victor managed.
<br />
<br />Eddie walked by the door again, peeking his head in momentairily. &quot;Whoopseydays! Musta' the wrong right.&quot;
<br />
<br />McLausky shook his head as Eddie walked on. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Now you get outta' here too.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Aye sir.&quot; and with that, Victor left leaving only McLausky. 
<br />
<br />McLausky sighed and started to lock up.
<br />
<br />T-T-THATS ALL FOLKS!</div>
