<br />
<br />Half-Life - Revolution
<br />Chapter 1 
<br />
<br />Subject : Cam Sherman
<br />Employment : BMRF (Black Mesa Reactionary Force)
<br />Disaster Responce Priority : Very Low
<br />Prioritys : 1) Protect all Scientists working at BMRF
<br />               2) Contain any threat until Military assistance arrives.
<br />Observation : Commencing .......
<br />
<br />
<br />Cam Sherman woke up at 8:00 am, in his boot camp-style bed,as he usually did. He didn't know why he did, because there was only a day of training and drills to look foward to, as there usually was. There were very little &quot;threats&quot; to contain at the Black Mesa , and the scientists made no effort to contain their evident arrogance against the Reactionary Force, with snide remarks out of the corner of their mouths every time Cam and the rest of the Force went into the main complex. Cam sat up and got dressed, and left his room, and finally walked into the coffee lounge, where another team member, Grey, sat. Grey was a middle age man, the &quot; Techno-Weenie &quot; of the Reactionary Force.  He could handle any type of computer, or electronics device, better than even most of the scientists of the complex, but also trained with the boys at the Rifle range, and was becoming quite a good shot. Cam himself was ordinarily looking, muscular ,and reasonably tall, but he didn't want to be a hero, he just took on his role of team leader as best as he could. Carrying a standard MP5 rifle had been boring at first, but Cam got used to it, and could shoot a target in the head at one thousand metres with a single shot. All of the team respected him, and he gave them respect back.
<br />
<br />&quot;Morning&quot; Cam said, while moving to pour himself a coffee.
<br />&quot;Hey&quot; said Grey &quot; Got anything planned for today ?&quot;
<br />Cam shot him a scathing look, as if Grey didn't know what was going to happen.
<br />&quot; Drills, huh ?&quot; Grey shot back.
<br />&quot; Yup &quot; said Cam sitting down, dring his coffee.
<br />
<br />They both sat there for half and hour, making small talk, when finally the others, Jones and Stanley trudged into the lounge.  &quot;About time .... &quot; muttered Grey, winking at Cam.  Jones shot a viper glance at Grey, and Grey abruptly became quiet.  Jones was a tall, well buit man, suited to to his task of heavy-gunner in the team, but in addition to doing the usual drills he also worked at the BMRF Gym, which most of them didn't do.  Stanley was the team's sniper, and prefered his Dragnov Russian Sniper Rifle over any other weapon.  He, like Grey was reasonably well built, and carried around a vial containing Diazapam on his belt.  &quot;Guess we'd better get to the &quot;Briefing Room&quot; now &quot; he said tiredly, greeted by the ritural chuckles of the team.  The room hadn't been used for a briefing since the original excursion to &quot;Xen&quot; in the Lambda Core, six months ago, which had gotten a few specimen samples, with minor fighting involved to obtain them.  It had been a quick, ten minute job which had gotten the scientists so excited it seemed to the team that they had thought Christmas had come. &quot;I suppose we'd better get on with it &quot; said Cam, and the others nodded tiredly. After moving into the breifing room, Cam popped up his feet on the table, and the rest of the team moved into the room, with Grey holding the notices.
<br />
<br />&quot; So, whats in todays notices ? &quot; Cam asked with a bored denemor, knowing what to expect.
<br />Grey flicked through the notices &quot; There's only an experiment going on in the Anomalous Research test labs, no expected side-affects, we can sit that one out &quot; 
<br />&quot; Anything else ? &quot; asked Jones.
<br />&quot; Nope, I guess we'd better get to training before the Administrator comes down here personally&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />None of the team had ever met the Administrator, but were refered to the job from the Marine Corps, after training with the Hazardous Enviroment Corps. Their drill instructors had simply entered their rooms early in the morning, and told them to get dressed and get onto an awaiting helicopter outside.  Only once they were in the air did the instructor explain to them what they were doing. He told them that they would be a part of the Black Mesa Reactionary Force, a special team made by the Administrator to combat any initial threat in the complex before any other military units arrived.  They were told that while the Security Guards would take care of the equipment, they were to evacuate any scientists they found, and contain any threat until the Military Hazerdous Enviroment Corps arrived.
<br />
<br />The team walked into the armoury to collect their weapons for training, when suddenly the ground shaked, nearly throwing them off their feat.
<br />
<br />&quot; WHAT THE H--- !!! &quot; Grey yelled, grabbing onto the nearby railing, like most of the team.
<br />A siren rang after the earthquake, shattering the silence.
<br />&quot; All units to your nearest evacuation point, this is not a drill, I repeat ..... AAAHHH !!!!!! &quot;
<br />The person was cut off by a loud electronic sound, like a bolt of lightening had struck him.
<br />
<br />All the team looked at each other for one second, then bustled to grab their weapons.
<br />&quot; Some day .... &quot; muttered Gray

<br />Chapter 2 coming soon ............

<br />I just can't see how &quot;wolfy and the temple of spam&quot; can make a good fanfic. All the good fanfics I've seen have been based around a serious thing (apart from sycho_warrior's one of course, which is brilliant <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), so I kind of turned it into something I hope was sensible.
