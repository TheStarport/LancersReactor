			<div class="content">Crossover!
<br />
<br />Scene opens in some bar.
<br />
<br />Orillion: Trent! Good to see you again.
<br />
<br />Trent: Whatcha got?
<br />
<br />Orillion: I think I have something that might interest you.
<br />
<br />Fade to Cut Scene.
<br />
<br />In the foreground hangs a Dom Kovash hypergate. In the background is a beautiful nebula. The hypergate slowly rotates as the POV camera circles around.
<br />
<br />Orillion (vo): As part of our duties to guard against the Nomads' return, the Order has been sending exploration missions into the hypergate network.
<br />
<br />The hypergate begins its activation sequence.
<br />
<br />Orillion (vo): Since encountering hostile Nomads was always a possibility...
<br />
<br />A spacestation rotates into view. It is obviously modular in construction, but the modules are unlike anything in the Sirius sector. There appears to be a battle going on around the station.
<br />
<br />Orillion (vo): ...these exploration parties were of course heavily armed...
<br />
<br />A small fleet of 8 Anubis fighters followed by a Clydesdale freighter fly out of the hypergate and straight into the middle of the battle.
<br />
<br />Orillion (vo): ...in case they had to fight. One party did.
<br />
<br />The Anubises scatter as both sides turn on the newcomers in a free for all. The unknown fighters all have a flattish look to them compared to the Order fighters. They also maneuver strangely, often flying in one direction and turning to fire in another. When an Anubis and local fighter fly near each other, the local appears almost twice the size of the Anubis.
<br />
<br />Orillion (vo): But they didn't run into nomads. The other side was...
<br />
<br />Zoom in on the cockit of the local fighter until the pilot can be easily seen.
<br />
<br />Orillion (vo): ...human.
<br />
<br />The pov camera pulls away until the station is visible. On the side in clearly labeled Roman lettering is GALSPAN.
<br />
<br />Fade out.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br />Later on in the Campaign...
<br />
<br />Bora Fighter 1: What kind of idiot doesn't put shields on a capital ship?
<br />
<br />Bora Fighter 2: My kind of idiot.

			<div class="content">First of all,
<br />
<br />all parties must be more equally equiped, it is simply to easy after single player is over. Raiding in the liberty system is boring, they cant even hurt your shields.
<br />
<br />Weapons,
<br />why not come up with &quot;Set-Weapons&quot;, which alone is weak, but when combined with each other, or shield gets more powerfull. Needles to say that theese weapons cant be sold at any station, but has to be obtained in Battle.
<br />a little bit like in RPG games. And please a CLOAKING DEVICE!!!
<br />Missiles.....something has to be done, it is at the moment a waste of hardpoints on your ship to mount them.
<br />
<br />Ships, 
<br />well we need at freighter, which is able to carry level 10 guns.
<br />
<br />Story Line, well obviously the nomads are not finised yet, they will return in someway.
<br />
<br />Missions, what i would like to see is missions, like for instance sneak into a different system with a spy on board, or attack something in a different system. Not limiting the missions to 1 objective but to several. 
<br />
<br />Opgrading Stations deffence, their firepower is a joke at the moment!</div>

			<div class="content">I agree with equal systems. 
<br />
<br />More tweaking should be possible.  Guns with adjustable fire - damage rates. You can adjust it to shoot faster, but with less oomph.  Shields that can be tweaked for faster regeneration, but less overall power, or more power but less regeneration. Higher level items have higher potential of course. 
<br />
<br />A firing control computer option, that can be very upgradable. One that can autotrack turrets, and let you get hits easier. A low level computer would let you get hits from near misses, a high level computer would run turrets. OOH! even better! You could have one or the other, but not both. 
<br />
<br />More thrusters... Higher max speeds with higher level thrusters. 
<br />
<br />Missile only hardpoints, and missile turrets. That way you can have missile frigates for transports.
<br />
<br />Upgradable tractor beams, with the highest levels able to tractor from further away. 
<br />
<br />Multiple projectile torpedos, that split after firing.
<br />
<br />Vector thrusters for faster strafing.
<br />
<br />EMP cruise disruptors that SHUT DOWN a ship completely for an amount of time. Higher level=more time.
<br />
<br />Powerplant upgrades. For more &quot;gerbil&quot; units. 
<br />
<br />Mines that are more persistent. And minelayers. Ships that are designed to carry and deploy mines RAPIDLY. 
<br />
<br />The option to sacrifice cargo space for ammo space. 
<br />
<br />MORE THAN 10 LEVELS OF GEAR.  O yea... no more Uberguns. I mean really... why do 1100 damage when most things die fine from 200? Other than the HOORAH factor. 
<br />
<br />Every house should have level 1 thru 10 fighters, transports, and light fighters. HOWEVER, they should NOT be easily attainable.</div>

			<div class="content">An autopilot with an EVADE option. That way, I might actually use turret mode in combat. Freighters can become useful gunships.
<br />
<br />A slide mode.
<br />
<br />Missiles that'll track something other than fighters. I once fired an expensive missile while locked onto a weapons platform. The missile went straight ahead, not at the platform which was off to the side but still in front.
<br />
<br />Torpedoes with some kind of tracking ability.
<br />
<br />More mission variety.
<br />
<br />The ability to hire a squadron. I'd make one of my squadron mates a freighter.
<br />
<br />Hmm... should a pilot for hire come with their own ship or should you have to provide them with one? Or both? Shipless pilots are more expensive (you have to provide the ship), but you get a say in what they're carrying.
<br />
<br />I'd also like to be allowed to dock with a hostile station. Of course, if you do that, it'll be suicide since you'll either be instantly arrested (House bases) or executed (Pirate bases). Depending on your faction reputation, you might be able to talk/bribe your way out of a hairy situation. If the faction owning the base is also hostile, you're dead meat, but you might have a chance against neutrals and friendlies.

			<h3><a href="#p150285" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">@ Everyone who suggested the Coalition:Watch the Un-Cut Intro.
<br />@ Everyone who suggested the Nomads: The nomad story is totally faggy. No reason why they randomly start killing humans, how/what the ships are made of, they just are there. There is a mega Dyson Sphere only minutes away (assuming the use of the Alien Jump Gate) from the Order homeworld. GOOD PATROLLING Orillion. The Nomads are fags.
<br />@ Everyone who suggested the Corsairs/Outcasts:Good plot, good ideas, but I think that they, even with their great technology (and realistically), SHOULD lose in a battle, even if Rheinland is kinda weak right now. Realistically, Liberty say, SHOULD kick their ass. Except you start in Liberty so they make it suck balls.
<br />My Ideas: (1)Corsairs/Outcasts *Attempt* to attack Rheinland and the Sigma Systems.
<br />(2)Base Editor, System Editor, Ship Editor (maybe paintjobs. Someone already mentioned these, credit to them....But some to me <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) and Faction Maker.
<br />(3)Better AI <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />(4)For the story line, It should be longer and WAY more free, like Morrowind. You can go and kill Lord Vivec as long as you have the skill to pick the lock on his temple. Try killing Orillion or President Jacobi in Freelancer. The plot should have 2 houses, (Say Rheinland and Kusari) Fighting over the Idependant Systems that interconnect them. While this fighting happens, (Say Sigma 13) they find out that the sun there is actually just....Forget that part about the sun <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Say while the fighting happens, The Red Dragon's attack Tekagi's Arch, which is now renamed to {New Kusari president's} Arch. So Kusari withdraws their forces to return to Tohoku to fend of the Red Dragons. Only to find that the President has been kidnapped. You start where ever you want to, you can start as a Red Dragon planning that great attack, A rheinlander that is trying to secure Sigma-13, or Kusari who is getting wooped and you help turn the tides by smuggling in a secret project from Juneao Shipyard in Alaska, after you hack into the security files of the Lib Navy. Then Liberty hates you. The news boards should reflect more on what's ACTUALLY happening, not some Lane Hacker that won a Surf Competition or a Hamburg Robot Mascot that got shot. Trust me, I read them both. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> There needs to be WAY more FREE in the Lancer.
<br />(5)More than just space things, like you walk around in a base, looking for a certain person trying to ilude you. There are like, 4 or 5 equipment shops in Manhattan, same thing with bars.
<br />(6) More freedoms on things that would be locked on MP or after SP. Like in the story, say when and if you hack into Juneao Shipyard, and then run out, the Navy changes the codes and ways of the gate opening for you so you can't get in. But if you ambush a Naval Convoy that has been in Alaska, you take the data, and so on.
<br />(7) As many have said, hire people, get people, escort missions, rob missions, MORE MISSIONS!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Ok, that's about 4 expansions right there, but it's a topic to go around. Now to plot out the rest of that story line for a fan fiction. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I just erased my editing history, because damn, I just read it over after I posted it and it had millions of mistakes <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I think that SHOULD the people of Siris encounter a new alien race it would be completely new to the game... the Dom Kavash shouldn't be it especially when their technology is so insanely far ahead of the terrans millions of years before humans existed (the female doc said that) it would be slightly one sided unless they r some weak ass species that never had to fight a war.
<br />
<br />Scenario: Dom Kavash patrol  (say 3 fighters) enters Alaska, a fleet of dreadnoughts open fire on them.
<br />
<br />Dom Kavash 1: I don't like those lights they are pointing at us
<br />Dom Kavash 2: Yeah i know, why do they have to do that?
<br />Dom Kavash 3: Oh well... i guess they need to be taught how to be polite.
<br />Dom 1: ok just leave a couple for me
<br />Dom 3: i'll try
<br />Collective thoughts of Lib fleet: holy shi...
<br />
<br />personally i think they should go back to the colonization of siris and expand/clarify on the 5v8 sleeper ships thing and the hispania and not let this turn out to be a can Aerith/Aeris be revived thing that FF7 turned out to be
<br />
<br />Courage isn't the ability to fly head on into the jaws of death with an arrogant smile.  Its the ability to run away from a couple of Xenos and face the laughter.

			<div class="content">I bet Juni turns out to be a fembot.
<br />
<br />Seriously though- the game should be larger. And maybe the coalition expanded as well till they became almost as powerful as the old alliance. And there should be a full scale war.
<br />I can just imagine the fight. Liberty gets sent in and promptly owned. So does Bretonia. Half the Kusari fleet comes limping back. Rheinland goes in and loses a handful of gunboats and one battleship.
<br />
<br />And finally, the GMG, Outcasts, Bounty Hunters and Corsairs (the most powerful groups, with lvl9-10 vhf's) go in and own the coalition.</div>

			<div class="content">About the Coalition...
<br />
<br />Why is it that everyone's all set to avenge the Alliance? After 800 years, there is no Alliance anymore. There are just four major feuding Houses with numerous smaller factions. No one in the game is interested in going back to Earth at all.
<br />
<br />By the same token, there's probably no Coalition anymore. Odds are, whoever holds Earth has morphed into something else. They are probably just as faction ridden as the Sirius sector. They're also probably more advanced technologically because they didn't spend the past 800 years sleeping or building up from almost nothing.
<br />
<br />That's why I liked to use the Tachyon background for what the post-Coalition Sol System looks like. It posits a weak central government with feuding frontier factions. Tachyon: the Fringe also takes place about 400 years prior to FL's present so we get to see how Tachyon turns out. It's a setting that's different from the Sirius sector, but similar enough to be compatable with FL.

			<div class="content">I think there will be no expansion pack, but a whole new game. Continuing on with Trent, Juni, etc.
<br />
<br />Why people think the coalition should come into it i dont know, and the Nomads, well they know their no match for us.
<br />
<br />I think the next episode should have a more in depth view as to why the Hispania never made it. The Outcasts members onboard the Hispania somehow changed, why? The Cardamine, where did that develop/originate, maybe it was found along with the Rhienland expedition to the uncharted planet. A deeper insight to the 80 year war between the GMG and Rhienland. And Finally Quintaine and Sinclaire discover what actually happend to the Don' Kavosh, and maybe their return, freind or foe
<br />
<br />Plus the extras, new ships
<br />                        Weapons/equipment.
<br />                        The uncharted Systems
<br />                        Reverse engined hyper gate
<br />                        etc......
<br />
<br />&quot;Of you haven't got anything nice to say, come and sit next to me&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Stealing a page (or the whole book!) from Starflight, maybe the Dom Kavash happen to be the orange grass the Outcasts make Carmadine from. The Nomads are mad at humanity because humans are essentially grinding up their masters and imbibing them. They discovered this because one of the Rheinlanders on that expedition was a Carmadine user.
<br />
<br />The previous contacts the Nomads had with the Outcasts were at a distance, and the genetic changes in the Outcasts may have made them part Dom Kovash.

<br />Freelancer Online would incorporate something called: Pay after you buy the game.
<br />
<br />And throughout single player, and also after the campaign, there are some things that just don't seem to fit, like on Toledo, where you see the 'hover rings' that you see under a ship when it's on the ground. Some believe that there was supposed to be a ship there.
<br />
<br />What is the deal with the unknown systems? There are so many things missing from there. On one of the planets, the navigation hud that lets you go to the bar, equipment dealer, launchpad, and things like that is unfinished. For example, in the bar, you can go to the launch pad and equipment dealer. But from the equpment dealer, you can only go to the commodity dealer or the launch pad. Someone didn't have enough time to finish coding all of the buttons before some company *cough*Microsoft*cough* forced Digital Anvil to cut it short. 
<br />
<br />The point I'm trying to make, is that I really don't care if the game comes out later than the announced date, just finish it before you release it. I'd rather get a full game with many secrets and things to explore three weeks late rather than a semi-completed game on time.
<br />
<br />
<br />My suggestions for a sequel would be that during the times like when they're all on the prison ship, you take a 1st person control like the 007 games. Then you run back to your ship when you complete your objective.
