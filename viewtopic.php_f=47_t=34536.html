			<div class="content">OK, since no one joined my last RPG, Total War topic, I will attempt to resurrect it.
<br />
<br />the story:
<br />
<br />The year is 313 A.S., and peace was all through the colonies. After the Alliance's final stand against the Coalition, five sleeper ships were launched in the year of Gemini. One was sabotaged and drifted off to the edge of the Sirius system, but the names of the other four are now legend, the Bretonnia, the Rheinland, the Kusari, the Liberty. When the ships were launched and broke throughout the Coalition blockade, they embarked on a 74 year journey to the Sirius system. Now, 313 years after the first sleeper ship arrived, times were hard, and were getting even harder. A small faction of people broke away, they were known as The Resistance. They had no plans to live in peace beside the new Sirius Government, instead, they wanted war and hardship.
<br />
<br />The war started when Kusari began to blame Liberty for the convoy attacks in the Galileo system just Northeast of the Colorado system, and Southeast of Shikoku. Kusari claimed it was Liberty's inability to control the Rouge problem. When the president of Liberty, Georgia Brush was going to meet with Shogun Motsumo on planet New Tokyo, things went horribly wrong. Three of the four Liberty battleships that were escorting her were secretly hijacked by a group of Resistance mercenaries. They used the massive front cannons to destroy the Liberty Cruiser Omaha, killing the president of Liberty.
<br />
<br />Liberty blamed Kusari for the assassination of Brush, but they denied it. After intense disputes, Liberty declared war on Kusari. When Bretonnia tried to stop, they were attacked by Kusari. Bretonnia had been a close ally of Rheinland, and finally, Rheinland got involved. After learning of the attack, Rheinland declared war on Kusari and Liberty. Bretonnia felt they needed no allies, and ordered Rheinland to withdraw from the war, but they refused. It was then that Bretonnia ordered war against Liberty, Kusari, and Rheinland. All four of the major houses were now in an all out war....
<br />
<br />OK, now it is your turn. I have a couple of rules, so please be considerate and follow them, as they are quite simple.
<br />
<br />1) No Nomads (unless they are in the unknown systems and around the jump holes in OA and OG.)
<br />2) No story characters. No Trent, no Juni. Keep it realistic, this is like five hundred years before they are even born.
<br />3) I set any major events. A major house getting it's butt kicked, that sort of thing.
<br />4) When you start out, please don't go over 5 million credits.
<br />5) Instead of me having to explain this, just look at my example below.
<br />
<br />Name: Nicholas Masters
<br />Ship: Sabre
<br />Location: Omicron Beta, Ruiz base
<br />Faction: Outcasts
<br />Credits: 4.5 million
<br />
<br />6) My sixth and final rule is, please follow the other five rules. Hope you like this one a little better than the last one.</div>

<br />Life is so much simpler when you are shooting at people. They had run into some bounty hunters on there patrol. Man, Im glad im not in an army. Borderworlds were now getting alot more traffic from people escaping and live in the freeports or other hidden bases. The leders had ordered to up patrols to make sure no intruders got in. Mostly around the jumpholes. More weapons platforms had been deployed around all jumpholes 5 encircling each Beta, Theta, and Tau 37 jumphole. He was wondering if Outcasts should stay out of it, or join in attacking systems.... Bah it doesnt matter he thought. He had just made a ton of money on attackng a Zoner convoy of engine components. He bought a shiny new Series Z &quot;Sabre&quot; outfitting it with Krakens and Wyrms he felt pretty good. We would only get involved if they attacked us.

			<div class="content">OK dudes, I'm gonna join my own RPG now!
<br />
<br />Name: Nicholas Masters(my usual, <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />Ship: Titan
<br />Location: Planet Crete, Omicron Gamma, Edge Worlds
<br />Faction: Corsairs
<br />Credits: 1.5 million
<br />
<br />Nicholas Masters, a tall man at age 16, strong and well built. Today was his sixteenth birthday, and did he have a day ahead of him. It was the duty and test of all to-be Corsair pilots to complete what was known as the Rite. The Rite was a test all Corsair pilots had to pass before they were an official Corsair. His grandfather and his brother were both killed during the test, and his father barley survived. All who came back alive took an oath to never tell what it was like to those who have not already taken it, and therefore, many young people speculated about it. After eating breakfast and saying good buy to his mother and father, he headed out for the landing pad. Normally, he would be flying the ship one level under the Titan, but when he got to the landing pad, he was very surprised. Insted of the Centurion that he was expecting, there was a Titan waiting for him.
<br />
<br />When he got to the ship the pilot climbed out. The two shook hands and the man introduced himself. &quot;I'm wing commander Black, I will be your instructor for the flight.&quot; After Nick introduced himself to the strict, stern looking man, he smiled. &quot;Don't worry, I'm not a butt hole like some of the other instructors. But I will warn you, that when we get to a certain point, you will be on your own.&quot; He said. But all Nick could do was nod. Although the colonies were in chaos due to the Resistance, he still felt anxious to become a full-fledged Corsair. With all of the Liberty forces off to war, it would be much easer to pirate convoys in Liberty and Bretonnia. 
<br />
<br />When Nick and Black climbed into their ships, they launched for space. The trip through the atmosphere was smooth and went exactly as planed. From time to time, Nick thought he heard rumors that Samura and Agira had developed something called a &quot;Docking Ring,&quot; but were still in the testing phases. When both ships turned on their cruise engines, they headed for the green dust cloud on the Eastern edge of the system. He knew now that was the grave of his brother and grandfather, and a chill went down his spine. The instructor came over the radio, &quot;Don't worry, this test won't be for you to go and blow some aliens out of the sky. You just need to travel into the Unknown system and retrieve something from one of the planets. I can't tell you witch one, but it is only on one. There are hostile aliens throughout the system, but you don't have to fight them. When you have what is known as a Nomad Cannon, you can come back to Crete or Tripoli. Well, this is where I have to go, sorry kid, your on your own.&quot; The man turned off and headed back to Crete just as Nick entered the dust field.
<br />
<br />When he got to the jump hole, it began to glow like something was using it. When strange blue ships of an alien design emerged, they opened fire. Then the computer said something that sent a chill down his spine. &quot;Shield failed.&quot; He was going to die........
<br />
<br />hope you like my person ppl.</div>
