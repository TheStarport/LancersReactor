<br /><b>Freelancer Misc. Database made by SuBXeRo </b>
<br />This database contains most information modders use when creating their mods. For those of you who have used this before you know how helpful it is. Although you may have thought the older version was helpful, this new version is totally revamped from the older version. It now includes a better organized layout, and what I like to call &quot;The Easy Reference System&quot;. Almost all data in here now comes with it's IDS Number, Name of the Piece of Equipment and It's all in one Line. The data is also mostly Alphabetized by name for easier referencing. Newb modder or Ace modder should have this file, makes work go allot quicker.

<br /><b>WORTH A LOOK </b> 
<br /><b>FreeLancer CMP exporter made by Mario &quot;HCl&quot; Brito </b>
<br />FreeLancer CMP exporter plugin for Milkshape3D - v0.1
<br />Useful for converting new ships into FL.
<br /><b>What this plugin can do: </b>
<br />- It can export a model with multiple meshes and using multiple materials to CMP format.
<br />- It can place hardpoints on a ship, using specially made textures.
<br /><b>What this plugin can't do (but is planned for future versions): </b>
<br />- Properly do wireframe (as soon as VMeshWire is documented)
<br />- Animated ships.
<br />- Destroyable ship components.
<br />- Eventually cover objects other than ships

<br />
<br /><b>FreeLancer UTF editor made by Mario &quot;HCl&quot; Brito (w/ MFC) </b> 
<br />A small UTF editor which allows you to manipulate the tree-like structure of these files. It has importing / exporting commands to load and save to files the data present on the leaf nodes of these trees, for easier editing. You can even edit directly simple data structures (strings, integer arrays and floating point arrays). MFC library is statically linked.
<br />Texture: ((this part was rippped from the Tutorial Making a new ship from scratch by Imagine))  
<br />Open up your utf editor, for the texture the .mat file must be created from scratch.
<br />Create a file that looks like this
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=22614&amp;forum_id=29&amp;Topic_Title=%2A%2A%2ATUTORIAL%2A%2A%2A+Making+a+new+ship+from+scratch&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Editing+Tutorial+Forum&amp;cat_title=Freelancer+Editing&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank> <img src='http://www.lancersreactor.com/images/news/s146.jpg'></a>
<br />(antioch is the name of the texture)
<br />-in the dt_name branch, store a string with the name of your texture file, which in this case is &quot;antioch.tga&quot;
<br />-in the type branch, store a string &quot;DcDt&quot;
<br />-flip your texture file upside down.
<br />-in the MIP0 (MIP zero) branch, import the upside down texture file.
<br />-save this utf file with same name as your cmp file, except with extension .mat

<br />Freelancer SDK is set of decompressed ini files (over 1200) from the original game of Freelancer, you can use this package to make your mod making life easier since it contains fixes for all the major errors in the original source.

<br /><b>An Excellent scripting tool... Worth taking a LOOK </b> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /><b>Freelancer ids_name / ids_info to ids_info3 Generator developed by Crabtree </b>
<br />1. What this tool could do for you?
<br />* Generates automatically the strings which are used in ship scripts if you like to make your mod without editing a custom dll.
<br />* Because it is a science to understand how the Reshacker works and very hard to get the information out of the custom.dll created by modmakers.
<br />2. What it does.
<br />* Generates ((from your info)) in the fields special strings used by FLMM V.1.2.1 and above. 
<br />* Example
<br />o ids_name = 0 ;GENERATESTRRES(&quot;Y-Wing&quot;
<br />o ids_info = 0 ;GENERATEXMLRES(&quot;&quot;E-Wing&quot;
<br />o ids_info1 = 0 ;GENERATEXMLRES(&quot;&quot;xxxxx&quot;
<br />o ids_info2 = 0 ;GENERATEXMLRES(&quot;&quot;xxxxx&quot;
<br />o ids_info3 = 0 ;GENERATEXMLRES(&quot;&quot;xxxxx&quot;

<br /><b>Lancerthing v 2.3 made by MadPommie </b>
<br />A really cool graphical utility that visually shows you -
<br />1. Ships - gives you the base data for all pilotable ships.
<br />2. Map - gives you an overview and the inter connectivity of the systems - click a system or use the dropdown to get a detail map.
<br />- Detail maps - scales as close as could get. NB In Freelancer, the maps do NOT accurately show the data positions of objects so tried to emulate the positions as shown in Freelancer maps.
<br />- Click the base name or icon on map to get sell prices.
<br />- Click a secret icon to get the name/specials.
<br />3. Base Prices - select from drop down and click get info.

<br /><b>Freelancer CRC Calculator made by Reven </b>
<br />This is a very simple utility that simply calculates Freelancer CRC values. Many times when trying to decipher Freelancer file formats or the purpose of some UTF files, you needed to see what Freelancer nicknames are referred to by what ID numbers. Since a special CRC is used to do this in most cases, being able to generate a quick CRC from some text is essential. This little utility will generate a Freelancer CRC from text that you type. Also, if there is text on the clipboard, it will automatically give you the CRC for whatever text is there. This was compiled as to not require any external DLLs so as to make it easier to use.

<br /><b>For Mod Makers </b>
<br /><b><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=2126' Target=_Blank>FLScan Version 1.3 Freelancer Mod Scanner</a> by Accushot </b>
<br />FLScan is a program that will scan your modified Freelancer ini files looking for errors, saving you the time and headaches that this usually entails. You can direct the program to scan certain areas of your project or to simply scan the whole lot. An error report will be created which details the problems, common causes and possible ways to fix the problem.
<br />Another new feature introduced since version 1.2 is FLScan's ability to repair THN files that have been corrupted by the Fled-Thorn decompilation process. When the files are decompiled certain fields are incorrectly decoded and as a result the resulting scene is often completely unrecognisable.
<br />The PathBuilder is a new feature introduced in version 1.3 that can generate pathfinding information for a mod automatically. As well as saving you time this should help eliminate errors caused by incorrect pathfinding files, such as AI and navmap errors that can be serious enough to crash the game. In order to do this FLScan will inspect your universe files and attempt to plot paths around the universe, travelling as a player or NPC might do.

<br />What the zip file contains is the Missions folder from the Freelancer\DATA\MISSIONS folder.
<br />If you have ever scanned your mod with FLScan 1.3 you will find that, the Missions folder has 20 Errors in it after you applied SDK 1.3 or SDK 1.5.
<br />This zip folder fixes those errors. I have tested it many times with no problems in the Storyline Missions. These files should only be used with the SDK 1.3 or SDK 1.5.
<br />Extract the zip file into:
<br />C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Freelancer\DATA\MISSIONS
<br />letting it overwrite the files.
<br />It was made for those mod makers who want an error free mod.
<br />This is a fix that I have worked on for over a year now, so enjoy!

<br />This is an editor for use while modding Freelancer. It supports MDI/MTI (Multiple Tabbed and Multiple Document Interface). It will allow for the editing and saving of freelancer ini files (though they have to be decompressed already), saved game files (will decode on the fly if needed), and will allow for Regular Expression powered search and replace. The Regex is the core of this little (or not so little for a text editor) mini monster. I'm releasing it to the community as a pre-release Beta, and am looking for input. I'm not a professional programmer, but I'd like to know what people think of the software and am hoping that people like it enough to use it and to also help me to expand on it. I feel that it has good potential, and I welcome you all to use it and tell me what's good and not so good.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=2295' Target=_Blank><b>FL Rotation Calculator (FLRotCalc) by Erik McClure </b></a>
<br />(FLRotCalc) is a command line utility used for determining the rotation necessary for one object to point to another object.
<br />You enter in a first set of coordinates, and then enter in the second set of coordinates.
<br />The program will return rotational values that make the first object point to the second set of coordinates.
<br />The most practical use of this is Tradelanes.
<br />Put the value of the first tradelane in, then the value of the second tradelane in,
<br />and then assign the resulting rotational value to all of your tradelanes.
<br />They should match up in a perfect line! Useful if you need to calculate the rotations for tradelanes that go up or down.
<br />3D patrol paths are also an application of this.
<br />As long as you copy the position values into the program as you see them in the INI (minus the spaces), of course it should work like a charm.
<br />If it crashes on you, check the format of the coordinates your feeding it, and make sure there are no spaces, no weird characters, only the coordinates, a comma separating each of the 3 coordinates, and negative signs where necessary.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=2254' Target=_Blank><b>Freelancer Server Manager - server version by Buck Rogers </b></a>
<br />Here is a brief overview of what it does.
<br />The package incorporates excellent cheat prevention but needs the player to install a small client for it to work. (Microsoft .Net Framework v2.0 is needed) The cheat prevention uses a CRC checksum on crucial ini files and checks with the server before allowing the player to connect.
<br />It has built in banning, kicking and kick to bases. There is a nifty little auto unban function that will allow you to enter a time and date for banned players to be unbanned automatically and it will announce the unbans to the freelancer universe.
<br />It has built in Server Monitoring so if your server crashes it will shut down that awful error reporting window and restart your server. It has a built in timed restart 
<br />option to restart your server every X hours.
<br />It maintains a list of online players which displays their location, their ship and how many credits they have.
<br />It has a very comprehensive ship editor for changing ships and equipment and will even detect if a player has multi mounted during heavy lag and give you the option to remove the excess.
<br />There is a similar cargo/equipment editor.
<br />There is a rep editor that will allow your players to have those faction tags at the front of their names.
<br />A banners section that allows up to 34 individually controlled announcements.
<br />View Accounts by character name. A nice touch here is that the cheat prevention system uses a players MPAccountID as it's username and so stores their Account key server side so you will never get players saying that they have reinstalled and lost their characters. You can now retrieve this server side.
<br />It has a built in stat generator that allows you to create 5 different pages filtered by Kills, Missions, Money, Time Online and by Account. It also allows you customize how the page looks.
<br />There is a scheduler for the stats so they can be automatically generated each day.
<br />FLSM has a built in FTP Client that will upload your stats pages and it can schedule this to happen on a daily or hourly basis. It will also upload individual files to your web server.
<br />Lastly FLSM has a built in back up system that can backup player files and stat pages and keep copies for up to 14 days.

<br /><b>fladmin.dll made by FiiK </b>
<br />FiiK has come out of the lair to tweak out FLAdmin.DLL for server administrators to use in conjunction with <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=720' Target=_Blank> the IONCROSS Freelancer Server Operator</a> (JoeBoomz's awesome creation). This new DLL is a speed demon compared to its predecessor and is (probably) more efficient as well. If you use IFSO, it is advised by both Joe and FiiK to grab this ZIP file and update your version. (The ZIP file also contains the usual documentation for you programmers out there that might need it.)
<br />Server administrators: Close IFSO first. Then copy the FLAdmin.dll from the ZIP file to your &lt;WindowsSysDir&gt;\system32 directory. (You overwrite the previous file there.) Then start IFSO once more.
<br />No version number will be updated to this. It is a patch with minor updates.
<br />Technical support is always available at <a href='http://www.fiik.net/freelancersupport.html' Target=_Blank> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fiik.net/freelancersupport.html">http://www.fiik.net/freelancersupport.html</a><!-- m --></a>

<br />* Adobe Photoshop 5.0, 6.0, or 7.0 
<br />* HCL's Freelancer UTF Editor (with MCF) that you can find in The Lancers Reactor &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/editing/download/download.asp?id=202' Target=_Blank> Editing Utilities</a> &gt;&gt;&gt; <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/editing/download/download.asp?id=201' Target=_Blank> FreeLancer UTF Editor</a>

<br /><b>Hostile Universe Ships </b> 
<br />Description: A collection of Milkshape3D source files for some of the ships found in Hostile Universe.
<br />
<br /><b>Hostile Universe V5 Save </b> 
<br />Description: A saved game from Hostile Universe Version 5 that should avoid the save issues players have when running mods and trying to use old saves. Use this only if you have problems. This save should work with the latest version of Hostile Uninerse.
<br />
<br /><b>Hostile Universe </b>  
<br />Description: Hostile Universe expands Freelancers trading options and adds new missions, treasure hunts, lots of custom ships and many more things to the game. Unlike other Freelancer mods, HU does not change the freelancer combat system but it does add several new systems including but not limited too our very own Ringworld and NewMars systems.
<br />
<br /><b>HostileUniverse Plus! </b> 
<br />Description: This mod does not require HostileUniverse v8 but is designed to provide extra ships and weaponary that are aimed at this mod in terms of balance.
<br />This mod provides new multi-player characters with a complete map of normal Sirius (i.e. Non-Hostile Universe Systems, Bases, Holes and Gates).
<br />Adds Sabre XR Borderworlds Heavy Fighter to the game as an improved version of Sabre Borderworlds Heavy Fighter. Buyable at Planet Malta ship dealer.
<br />Adds Thunderbolt MkII Heavy Fighter to the game as an upgraded version of the Thunderbolt. Buyable at all Liberty/EFN Battleship ship dealers.
<br />Adds Lightningrod Experimental Tactical Fighter to the game as a redsigned version of the Thunderbolt. Buyable at Battleship Missouri ship dealer. RUMOUR: &quot;There is thought to be another variant of this ship design available as no evidence of the designers demise has been found&quot;
<br />We would like to give credit to the author's of the HostileUniverse v8, Drepanon, and Sabre XR mods as these mods are what prompted us to create our own and also provided the raw material to start our mod.
<br />
<br /><b>Ringworld V2 (for mod makers) </b> 
<br />Description: Ringworld is a collection of files for Freelancer mod makers so they can easily add Ringworld their own mods. It is not a playable mod in its own right.

<br /><b>FreeLancer Data Storm v3.8 - the complete Starmap made by HellFire </b>
<br />Version 3.8 of DataStorm runs like a finely tuned race car. HellFire has DataStorm working so good now it can parse the Freelancer files with a Mod installed in 60 seconds. Version 3.8 of DataStorm still comes with a Full-Installer which checks for missing Files on your System and downloads the files automatically if any are needed. So the file is still quiet small at just 2.24MB The included setup.bat checks for missing files on that system and downloads the system files. DataStorm can read all modified-data in the correct order and works fine with Mods (Shows ALL Ships).
<br />DataStorm also gives you an Error-Log. Nice for checking your Mod for errors. By default DataStorm stores the ((DataStorm.fl Error Log file)) in My Documents\My Games\Freelancer\Accts\SinglePlayer the file name will be DataStorm.fl. That way the Mod-Manager from IGx89 v1.2+ and higher saves the MapData together with save games and if you activate a new mod.
<br />DataStorm can:
<br />Show the complete Map, all systems even Modified and new systems show up.
<br />Calculate Prices per Base/Station.
<br />Search for Planets, Stations, Bases and Objects.
<br />Search for a Ship by Name.
<br />Search for Equipment.
<br />Search for Bribes.
<br />And Print Maps or show them on screen.

<br /><b>Ship Icon Tutorial made by Osprey </b>
<br />This is an excellent tutorial for making ship icons in Freelancer. After much research, trail, error, and frustration, I've finally gotten it down. Now I'll share it in complete detail with everyone else. I purposely made this tutorial very detailed so that absolutely anyone would be able to follow it. Therefore, I beg forgiveness from the more artistically adept amongst you. Or, for that matter, the more technically savvy. Lots of screenshots are included in this tutorial to make it even easier. I use Photoshop 7, so the explanations and images here reflect my preference in image editing software. If yours is different, you should still be able to follow along.
<br />Tools needed:
<br />Photoshop (or another image editing program)
<br />Freelancer UTF Editor
<br />Freelancer CRC Calculator

<br /><b>Freelancer Trading Tool version 4.1 made by Acid </b>
<br />I want to point out that this application is in Active Server Pages ((ASP)) format so if you don't run ASP on your computer this Tool is not for you. If you don't want to go to all the trouble of loading IIS on your PCs at home, there is a freeware ASP compliant web server that has no problem running this application. It's called Baby Web Server, it's about 300k in size and takes minutes to install and configure. Take a look if you want to use this application at home while playing the game. The URL for Baby Web Server is on the download page.
<br />After a few hours sleep Acid got a brain wave and has revamped most of the inner workings of the FLTT application to make version 4.1 run a little faster and make the changes a little more global. This application is more of a data browser, which allows people to look at a large array of data in different ways. The first screen comes up and asks you where you are, you select a station and then the application shows you what that station sells, and where you can sell those commodities for a higher price. There is also nav data for the base, etc.
<br />There is also a system detail page which shows you where all the bases and jump holes are, and there is information on ships and weapons as well. On the list pages for the weapons and ships the info can be sorted by clicking on the appropriate column heading. There is also a commodities summary page which gives you the min sell and the max buy locations for each commodity, and shows the maximum profit possible for the commodity.

			<div class="content">PJT15253 there is no &quot;known&quot; ship modeling program that can make ships. You are always going to have to code some where. Milkshape is a good program but if you have no experence in Milkshape your SOL (unless you read up on the tutorials about milkshape). Hope i helped.

			<div class="content">Hey Guys.
<br />
<br />In reference to &quot;Not being able to use GMAX or MS3D to make ships&quot; you can try this alternative.
<br />
<br />1st, Check out Drizzt4.0's Tut: <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=27904&amp;forum_id=29&amp;Topic_Title=%2A%2A+Tutorial+%2A%2A+%2D+Drizzt4%2E0%27s+FL+Ship+Creating+Tutorial&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Editing+Tutorial+Forum&amp;cat_title=&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank>** Tutorial ** - Drizzt4.0's FL Ship Creating Tutorial</a>
<br />
<br />and also, check out my Tut: <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=31888&amp;forum_id=29&amp;Topic_Title=%2A%2A%2ASubstitute+Ship+Creation+Tutorial%2A%2A%2A&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Editing+Tutorial+Forum&amp;cat_title=&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank>Using Valve Hammer Editor to do the structure creation of your ship</a> if you cant get the hang of GMAX. I cant do anything in GMAX except the EXPORT part in Drizzt4.0's tutorial, so I played with VHE till it worked.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this is informative.
