			<div class="content">Hi space sims fans &quot;Spaceforce 2&quot; will come out in a few weeks or months and it could very well be the next best one after Freelancer,it's got it all look below.
<br />
<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.spaceforce2.com">http://www.spaceforce2.com</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />What I would like is for us to discuss it here and hopefully make a forum for it later.
<br />
<br />Eventually they might enable MP and Mods, but first they want people to enjoy the game,
<br />This isn't the original post it was moved and I couldn't find it, hopefully now it's in the right place.
<br />So let me know what you think.
<br />
<br />GAMEPLAY
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Player can easily recruit pilots whose status is friendly to your civilization, while hostile-status pilots will attack you
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Player can recruit and command up to 3 wingmen at the same time, which can be individually managed to attack, form-up, and do some other commands
<br />
<br />&#8226;   An open ended, beautiful and innovative 3D space environment decorated with stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, black holes, star bases, floating cities and open for exploration, trade, crafting, diplomacy, fight
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Infinite number of action-filled adventures and endless missions
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Choose your role among many professions and start exploring the space or follow the storyline
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Player is able to develop his avatar following the role he/she likes to play in the game and can choose between trader, spy, soldier, scientist, headhunter, doctor, pirate, policeman or simply an adventurer
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Player is able to explore the galaxy as a member of one among 10 civilizations placed on different starting location across the universe
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Trade goods, destroy ships and buildings, explore unknown anomalies and ancient ruins, visit orbital stations and distant places and travel using jump gates
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Make your way through known and unknown star systems in the Milky Way galaxy
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Discover a lot of special equipment including damage boosters or mining tools
<br />
<br />&#8226;  As you progress through the game, each ship can be modified in your own creative style by upgrading: speed, target system, jammer, shield, armour, manoeuvrability, weaponry, afterburner, cargo space and weight
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Integrated in-game diplomacy system can determine whether you are at war or at peace with a civilization
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Loads of galactic press news will help you combine facts, making your funds go up or down, because by investing, you can make more money or lose everything
<br />
<br />&#8226;  10 civilizations available
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Since the AI has a crucial role in SpaceForce2, it will create a thrilling playing experience throughout the game
<br />
<br />&#8226;  Non-stop action with loads of star vessels within beautiful constellations make SpaceForce 2 an intriguing and exiting space game
<br />
<br />&#8226;   The ships neural core computer system &#8211; Harmonia, will guide you through the game, help you win situations and make your coffee 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Rank advancement
<br />
<br />&#8226;  The dynamic universe
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Build a steady reputation and be well known throughout the galaxy
<br />
<br />&#8226;  ID cards will help you infiltrate, and communicate with your enemy's
<br />
<br />AI
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC is aware when he's locked 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC knows when we are on his tail 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC calls for assistance through radio if he's in danger 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC can respond to calls of other NPC's 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC knows when a missile is fired upon him 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC is aware of surrounding objects (buildings, meteors, spaceships...) and also of his locked target and chooses the best maneuver
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPCs advances through skills, just like your character 
<br />
<br />&#8226;  NPC knows when he has disadvantage in a battle and when it's time to flee 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC's awareness in diplomacy makes him act accordingly to rules 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC will attack us if our cargo is valuable to him 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   NPC recognizes if we fire upon him, and he communicates with other ships to convince them to attack us 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Some races are more intelligent than others, and for example are aware of the sun direction so they can use it to flee 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Every NPC will make enough room for himself to make the attack
<br />
<br />&#8226;   During a battle NPCs communicate with each other in order to rearrange forces, so there will be maximum two NPC's on one target, and they will not be on each other's way
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Every NPC has his own personality, and can make his own decisions despite his current orders. His decision also depends on pilot's race, for example, collective pilots are violent and inhuman, which makes them hard to give up when lose in battle and they are easy on trigger to attack you without cause. Pirates can attack if you carry valuable cargo, but they will easily flee if situation is not favorable for them. 
<br />
<br />ENGINE
<br />
<br />&#8226;   High performance realtime 3D rendering using DirectX 9.0c 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   True 64 bit HDR rendering if card supports it, HDR fresnel, HDR specular, HDR bloom and glow, star effect, tone mapping (adaptive exposure), HDR antialiasing, blue shift 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Real time enviroment lightning 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Cool post processing effect like full screen motion blur, black and white rendering, blur, screen filtering, screen space refraction 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Pixel doubling rendering for slow graphics cards 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   3 different rendering engines SM 1.4, 2.0, 3.0 so a wide list of graphics cards is supported 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Advance particle system with collision including effects like billboards, flares, lens flares, smoke, fire, sparks, debris, beams, all particles can be rendered in refraction buffer and make effect like glass, smoke, heat effect, shock wave and much more 
<br />
<br />&#8226;   Flare perpixel occlusion 
<br />

<br />
<br />We all know but won't admit it FL is getting very old most mods but not all are dying. Even on popular ones no matter how many ships or systems are in, it's the same old thing.
<br />
<br />I would love Asgard among others to move to a new game when the time is right but personnaly I will move on when a better one comes along.
<br />
<br />Some of you will choose to play FL until you're 85 and on a respiratory system and I respect that...
<br />
<br />The purpose of this thread is to browse the Spaceforce 2 forum and FAQ section and to begin discussion on something fresh and exciting...
<br />
<br />Enjoy and no flaming please...

			<h3><a href="#p420166" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Q: Release date?
<br /> 
<br />A: The expected release date for the game is Q1 2007 (First quarter of 2007)
<br /> 
<br />Q: Is the game going to be released in english?
<br /> 
<br />A: Yes
<br /> 
<br />Q: Is the game going to be released through online digital distribution as well?
<br /> 
<br />A: Yes
<br /> 
<br />Q: Widescreen? 
<br />
<br />A: Yes the game has widescreen support but not hard tested. Before I posted this I tryed it in 1920x1080 and it looks awesome. Wide screen + HDR + Soft shadows + 3.0 shaders 
<br />
<br />Q: Distribution Plans, Where, When &amp; How? 
<br />
<br />A: Yes we will try to cover much as more areas including electronic distribution as well. For now we are working on rusian and english version. 
<br />
<br />Q: Copy protection? 
<br />
<br />A: No we are not bothering with that. Who wants to buy it, that one will buy and who wants to copy that one will copy. There is no chance that we can force someone to buy our game. With copy protection we can only harm sincerely ones that properly buy our game. And if someone like game why don't buy. It only can get better sequel. Especially from us, because we are very small team in development. 
<br />
<br />Q: Is there going to be any &quot;end-game&quot; playability? 
<br />
<br />A: Yes there will be the end game playability. First if you solve main quests there are plenty of side quests to do. But main quests are not so easy to solve because they are all over the system and you can't jump easily to that place. End even when you solve that there are 2000 side quests. Those are all side things and you don't need to bother with that if you don't want to. One of the goals is to make money to improve your ship so you could solve some quests that are more difficult than the others. At the beginning it is better to solve for example the satelite quests than the quests that include destroying the buildings. Not until your ship is upgraded. There are three classes of fighters: light, medium and heavy class. First class is the cheapest and can go max up to 5th level for every upgradable part. Only heavy fighters can go up to 10th level. And you have approximately 100 levels to upgrade. That costs to much and you must earn that cash. Every action you do gives you experience points and after that a rank. You have 30 ranks to reach and then you can say that you are an experienced pilot. Also there are medals. You can think of that as an extra side quest because you must do specific things to get those medals. And you have for now also two more side quests that are specific tehnology devices you must collect in order for your ship get specific abilityes. One si the &quot;Time device&quot; and the other is the &quot;Cloaking device&quot;. With one you can manipulate time aka &quot;matrix mode&quot; for short period of time and another is to become invisible. But there is one catch, those parts are not easy to get. There is a story behind those devices that will tell you how those devices came into existence. But in short there are plenty od pices to collect. And you have known stars systems which you can find on the map, secret jump gates and maps made by civilisations and secret maps made by mother nature. Plenty places to explore. And finally all maps are pretty dynamic so it will never be 100% the same. 
<br />
<br />Q: Will work on videocard Geforce 4-mx? 
<br />
<br />A: But this will get some changes. Right now, at this morning, I tryout game on radeon 9500 with 64 MB RAM. Options was: All medium settings, 2.0 shaders, postprocesing off, 1024x768, pixel doubling on, screen filtering on and everything run very smooth at 40-55 FPS. Very smooth fight. And don't forget that engine also supports 1.4 shaders and low texture quality and even lower resolutions. I would like to try it on GeForce4 but I don't have that card at this moment. 
<br />
<br />Q: Hardware recomandations 
<br />
<br />A: SF2 iz very flexible because the engine supports three different types of rendering: SM 1.4, 2.0, 3.0 so maybe you don't need to upgrade your PC. For instance one tester's configuration was radeon 9500 PRO, 512MB of RAM and everything at 1024x768, SM 2.0, all HIGH options was working average of 25 FPS. Radeon 9600 XT has average of 30 FPS with the same options but with 2x AA turned on. But with SM 1.4 turned on you can gain much better perfomance. We have even &quot;pixel doubling mode&quot; where graphics card renders 3D scene in half resolution but HUD, GUI and text is in full resolution. That mode in combination with &quot;filter screen&quot; option gives blazing fast FPS and acceptable image quality. But if you want the game look the best it can you must have a high end graphics card with minimum of 256 MB ram. Something like ATi X1xxx series or NVidia 7xxx. Especially if you want to play in HDR mode. But even 6800 will be great. The game has a built in benchmark so we can compare game perfomance with different configurations in order to get a better picture of supported configurations. After we test the game on a wider list of PC configurations we will publish much more accurate results here and on the site. That benchmark will be distributed with the game so any user can test his configuration.

<br />
<br />Q: Consoles? 
<br />
<br />A: For NOW there are no plans to release the game for consoles! 
<br /> 
<br />Q: will this game run on something else than Windows (r) ? For instance... on Linux ?
<br />
<br />A: &quot;No linux support for now&quot; - LevaOpaki
<br />
<br />Q: Will there be any micromanagement? 
<br />
<br />A: As far as I can see in my version (SF2 is dynamically changed every week) I wouldn't tag it &quot;micromanagement&quot; (the expression common used in strategy games), but yes, you must take care of hull, crafting, materials, cash, diplomacy, etc. but not of fuel, ammo and energy - except during shooting, there you must shoot effectively before your energy status goes low. Ah, and also there is thruster energy consumption, which is better when you upgrade your beast. The thing that also made an impression on me is upgrading - you can earn good cash and dock on base and there you can buy upgrades, BUT only to some percent (e.g. 60/100) of that part (targeting, speed, etc.) if you have enough money. And then comes sweet thing - if you want (we all want that) to make your ship a beast, you must buy or mine crafting materials in huge quantity (understandable if you want better upgrade) and add it to you ship to overflow number of 100. So your armor can be 120, weapons 115, targeting, jammers, etc. all better than enemy's and you are the boss That crafting thing is what makes me lurking around galaxy in abscence of story in beta version. Good enough, ha? 
<br />
<br />Q: In game bookmarks? 
<br />
<br />A: Right now we are working on the bookmarks where you can place a node in space and later auto pilot will bring you there if you press shortcut key. Cool if you find some mining filed and want to come back later. 
<br />
<br />Q: Will it be possible to comunicate with other ships in space, in order to trade, make &quot;friends&quot; (i mean co-opp), or get info? 
<br />
<br />A: Yes you can make all of that but in single player. You can select and scan other players, invite them in your party for money if they like you. Later, to that same pilots in your formation, you can give orders. Also you can trade with other trade ships. You can even hide your identity with ID cards if neccessary because trade ships can reject you if they don't like you by diplomacy. 
<br />
<br />Q: How do you improve your diplomacy rating with a civilization? 
<br />
<br />A: We can do that with different types of actions like solving their quests or paying them a tribute in credits. Attacking their enemy can be useful, too. Paying for diplomacy is the most expensive way. But also you can't pay to all races like for example collective. 
<br />
<br />Q: Will the game contain multiplayer and how will it work (i.e. Freelancer or something different)? 
<br />
<br />A: For the first release multiplayer is not planed but maybe it will be released in next patch or expansion. We imagined it to look like a deathmach (particulary action and dynamic fight). But we will see. 
<br />
<br />Q: Trade with military, narcotics, technology, tobacco, medicine, materials, industry, consumer, computer, chemicals and luxury goods 
<br />
<br />A: Yes, the trading system is dynamic, so the prices are never the same. And what also influences the prices is the demand on some product in the current system. The info about the economics and the demands you can read in the galactic news any time you like. So if you pay good attention to these news you can be a better trader. 
<br />
<br />Q: Player can recruit and command up to 3 wingmen to his fleet, which can be ordered individually to attack, form-up, and other various commands. 
<br />
<br />A: Number of wingmen depends on the class you have chosen in profile screen. In example, if you are a scientist, you have a possibility of recruiting only one wingman and if you are a soldier you can recruit up to three wingmen. During flight, when you encounter a ship, you can invite it's pilot to join you. If he is not your enemy by diplomacy and if you have enough money, he will accept and follow you wherever you go. You can also give him commands to attack your target, return to formation etc. 
<br />
<br />Q: Mouse control/Joystick control? 
<br />
<br />A: Flying is ultra easy like in the Freelancer but your skills, good manoevre and good aming can help you a lot. For example, don't espect that every heat seeking missile will hit a target. You must fire it at appropriate time. We are traying to make a game that depend on your skills. Your upgraded ship can help you a lot but your skills are on the first place. That is separating good pilots from noob ones. In game, for controls, you can chose between: mouse+keyboard or joystick(gamepad)+keyboard 
<br /> 
<br />Q:How are the space physics in SF2? 
<br />Newtonian: as in if im going really fast and I cut power to the engines will I continue to coast forward? 
<br />Arcade: or am I going to stop as though I have brakes and tires gripping the road? 
<br /> 
<br />A: The physics will be implemented in a ration of 50:50 (half Newtonian and half Arcade)
<br />
<br />Q: Physics in general 
<br />
<br />A: &quot;Yes, every explosion has an impact on all the objects around it. For example, if an explosion occurs in the middle of a meteor field they will all be scattered by it. Also, when two meteors collide, they break into smaller pieces which are also influenced by physics so we can collide with them and they will transfer their force on other near objects. Our ship can also be influenced by the explosion's blast radius and we will feal the shake depending on the distance from the blast. If any projectile collides with our ship, the ship will be diverted from it's original path so the pilot could ran into something while trying to align with the original path. The explosion's blast power can also divert lasers from their path. Some lasers can deflect from their target and hit another one. Big projectiles can be destroyed while moving to their target so you can prevent them from damaging your ship (nice targeting practice). 
<br />You can even lead biger and slower projectils to onother target while projectile is follow you. Watch out where you are opening fire because you can by mistake (e.g. destroying asteroids) begin galactic war The damage on our ship depends on the speed our ship was going when we ran into something. The movement and maneuver of our ship depends on the cargo we are carrying. So it's not reccomendable to go into battles while your cargo is full because the ship will be less effective. And there are some other things like particle physics, so for example when your ship flyes through the particle fog it will push it. You will make  hole in fog cloud.&quot; 
<br />
<br />EDIT 1: Every item has weight and occupation of space. Some items are large but not heavy. You must combine those to values for optimal use of you ship space. 
<br />
<br />EDIT 2: We are also implemented real time gravity of black holes but we don't know if we gona use it in that manner because we gate strange but anticipated result. Black hole suck all near by objects (e.g. asteroids ). I will try to use that for some big gravity bombs (short time gravity) and see what result we can get. 
<br />
<br />Q: Docking on planets? 
<br />
<br />A: There will not be docking on planets only on stations.  But we will have real large planet for the purpose of good feeling. You will burn your ship if you enter into atmosphere. 
<br /> 
<br />Q: 3rd person view? 
<br />
<br />A: And I am already known as info leaker, so here's the answer: yes, pal, there is a very good ship animation from 3rd person view. And there are cockpits in 1st person and you can also move HUD completely (just a crosshair), and there is &quot;orbital view&quot; (you can take screens outside the ship, while in move), and there is also &quot;spectator mode&quot;, similar to orbital but more flexible during pause, so you can watch explosions and take screens while you slow down the game by +/- keys (or speed it up). 
<br />And in the last version you can also zoom whenever you like. e.g. while you are behind ship, while you are in ship, while you are in orbit view. And this is not only  cosmeting thing. I use this all the time in fight for better aming. Great thing.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Docking in general
<br /> 
<br />A: You approach the base following blinking lights around gate. As soon as you see docking icon become in full color (not fade) you hit Enter key and base control confirm or refuse your docking.
<br /> 
<br />A: You can also use ID cards for docking. ID cards you can buy around are successful in percents, so if you fail with ID card of 65% for that race, try to find 90% ID card, for example.
<br /> 
<br />A: Also U will see in game (engine) short dock animation.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Missiles and countermeasures
<br /> 
<br />1. Will there be different types in regard to missiles homing capabilities(ie. radar, heat seeking)?
<br /> 
<br />2. Also will there be countermeasures(chaff, flare) and will there be an option(buy an upgrade for computer) to fire them automatically(ie. computer will detect missile lock and fire countermeasures without our intervention)?
<br /> 
<br />A: 1. For now all missiles are heat seeking. But distance on which you can lock someone is determined by the targeting level. 
<br />
<br />2. Both in some ways. On your ship you have upgradeable jammers and they are automatic. Better level of jammer, better chance to avoid missile. And you have EMP. You can activate EMP whenever you like but EMP wastes your shield energy. EMP destroys only missiles on short distance so it  must be activated at appropriate time. Also, better level of your shiled has more energy and you can fire more EMPs.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Tractorbeam
<br /> 
<br />A: Yes you have teleport beam and after you destroy non organic ship you can take his cargo on your ship and after sell it if you like. Also you can 
<br />analyse ruins and debris and teleport minerals and metals to your ship. Later you can use those metals  for crafting or selling.
<br />Everything you find you must teleport on your ship if you want to use it.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Will SF2 include somekind of Torpedo or MOAB (Mother of All Bomb) for massive bombardment?
<br /> 
<br />A: Yes we are working on something like that!
<br /> 
<br />Q: Will we be able to buy hydra-like missiles? One single missile that explodes mid-air and releasing smaller rockets?
<br /> 
<br />A: Yes we have that missile and we call it ecstasy rocket!
<br /> 
<br />Q: Crafting
<br /> 
<br />A: CRAFTING (simple version) I would like to post you a screen of what I am talking about here, but I don't know if it is against Provox policy, so read below: 
<br /> 
<br />1) if you want to upgrade your ship's armor, for example, you need Diamonds and Highsteel-7 as crafting materials. You can find it in some asteroids (you must do some mining around) and as a trading goods at bases and trading ships.
<br /> 
<br />2) when you get enough diamonds and highsteel-7, dock on any friendly base and go to tech-lab
<br /> 
<br />3) there you choose what level of armor you can make, according to quantity of crafting material you have. At first level of armor upgrade you need 7 units of diamonds and 11 units of highsteel-7, on 10th level you need 207 diamonds and 331 highsteel-7
<br /> 
<br />4) when you choose your armor's upgrade level, just let tech-lab make an upgrade for you
<br /> 
<br />5) go to ship upgrade room and apply your new armor (your older one you can sell). For example, if you apply 7th level armor upgrade, you can pull down your old 3rd level and sell it for some cash
<br /> 
<br />NOTE: All the same with other parts - speed, afterburner, manoeuverability, jamming, targeting, shields, weapons, etc.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Big Bertha aka Nuke bomb
<br /> 
<br />A: Yes it will be something like that. And you must run from blast wave 
<br /> 
<br />Q: Stations in general
<br /> 
<br />A: In one sector it will be more than one trade station but only one is licensed for giving quest mission and this is a main station. 
<br />With short cut key &quot;Jump to station&quot; you can fast jump near to main station. Of course only if you have enough jumping fuel.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Sectors
<br /> 
<br />A: For now we have 56 sectors and about 200 000 objects (ships, buildings, asteroids,...) in all sectors.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Is it possible to purchase capital ships?
<br /> 
<br />A: No
<br /> 
<br />Q: Ships in general
<br /> 
<br />A: For now there will be 14 buyable ships. 
<br />Don't take this surely, because game features vary from day to day but this is a minimum.
<br /> 
<br />A: 
<br />EMD
<br />- Interceptor   - Fighter   - Valkyrie
<br /> 
<br />UF
<br />- Interceptor   - Fighter   - Valkyrie
<br /> 
<br />Collective
<br />- Coocoon Bomber    - Hive defender   -Insecta fighter
<br /> 
<br />Alreani
<br />- Ressurector
<br /> 
<br />Chulta
<br />- Praying Mantis
<br /> 
<br />Draglon
<br />- Explorer
<br /> 
<br />Ezodar
<br />- Glider
<br /> 
<br />Makkinist
<br />- Fighter
<br /> 
<br />Ord
<br />- Patrol Ship   -Dreadnaught
<br /> 
<br />Yah-An-Ra
<br />- Made out of energy, so no ship we could fly I guess.
<br /> 
<br />Pirate
<br />- Corvette
<br /> 
<br />NOTE: You can't fly collective ones.
<br /> 
<br />A: Ships are devided in 3 groups: light, medium and heavy figher. 
<br />With first one you can go up to 5th level, second to 7th level and last to 10th level. 
<br />Every ship has different starting points so some ships are better for trading and some are better for fighting. When you buy another ship, the new one will have all upgraded stats from the last one so you dont need to go from the beginning.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Modding ships
<br /> 
<br />A: You can mod ships and stations as much as you like! The thing to keep in mind is that you cannot expand the number different ships and stations in the game so you will need to reuse the ships already in the game thus changing their models, texture, stats etc...
<br /> 
<br />Q: RPG or freeflight
<br /> 
<br />A: Some classes have unique skills. For example engineer can repair other ships e.g. wingmans. Some skills are shared by all classes but not all of them use them equally effective. For example all classes can hack but hacker is dealing better with security risk and is harder to catch him.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Cockpit
<br /> 
<br />A: There is 2D HUD and 3D cockpit. And you can turn off everything. Or maybe go in the 3rd person view.
<br /> 
<br />Q: Can I play my music files while I'm playing the game?
<br /> 
<br />I must mention here one cool feature that all of you will like. 
<br />With SF2 console you can control WinAmp. In the options just turn off music, you start WinAmp and write the commands in console to change songs, stop, pause etc. Commands examples:
<br />WinAmp Play
<br />WinAmp Stop
<br />WinAmp Next
<br />...
<br /> 
<br />Q: Due to the way each race seems to be different including technologically as well as functionality in their ships,will there be weapons that work only on a ship made by a particular race or are all weapons universal ?
<br /> 
<br />A: &quot;Some weapons you can buy only from specific race. But every ship can use that weapon.&quot; - LevaOpaki
<br /> 
<br />Q: Will the AI advance as the player gain experience or the AI will have ranks?
<br /> 
<br />A: &quot;... some kind of mixed solution would probaly be the best, so the more experienced your pilot is, the higher the probability it is to go against Ace pilots. &quot; - Augustini
<br />&quot;Then we will do something like that. &quot; - LevaOpaki
