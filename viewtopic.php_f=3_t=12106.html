			<div class="content">I think one thing I would really like to see further developed is your ability to immerse yourself in a given faction.  Wouldn't be cool if you joined the Corsairs and through various missions aquired through the &quot;bar&quot; system you moved up through the ranks of the Corsairs and maybe even help them expand their territory.  Maybe become a General of the Corsairs and have the option to command wing-men of your choosing.  
<br />
<br />Essentially, Freelancer allows you to have NO affiliations that are stronger than basic aquaintance.  You cant ever really become a member of a faction and take actions that affect the strength/territory/wealth/power of a given faction.  Wouldnt I be cool if you wanted to make ALL space taken over by Liberty?  Or by the Mollies?  And you could be the one to lead them to victory?  
<br />
<br />And, when you attack space stations/cruisers they should launch missles and fighters against  you.  None of this silly pansy turret stuff that doesnt even ding your sheilds.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p113637" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Altough I really like your ideas, I think a few of them are beyond the scope of a patch. What I think would be feasible though are the following:
<br />I feel that TOO many of the advanced ships cannot be accessed until after the plot is over. While I feel the sabre, titan, eagle should be left for after the plot, you do run accross bases that sell the stiletto on more than one occassion in the main game itself and it is frustrating not to be able to buy it. I would like to see the requirement for purchasing the stiletto lowered to level 17 so that I can purchase it before the whole stretch of missions at the end of the game. 
<br />Next, I think it would be bad if you could destroy battleships that are dockable bases in the game you could end up with a multiplayer server with no bases...it would suck. I think those should remain invulnerable. However, I feel that some other battleships should be added that aren't dockable and that are around to find in random encounters and in missions...ie: just cruising around like they were in Privateer one. They should be undockable, but vulnerable to attack just like installations in the random missions: u can't dock to them but you can destroy them. 
<br />I think both of those ideas should be easily feasible as the models already exist and simply need to be edited slightly. (Random no**d battleships would be nice too)
<br />Thirdly, escort and cargo random missions should be created, and unlike the current random missions, some should require that you leave the system.
<br />Fourthly, in accordance with changing the level of the stiletto, in the single player campaign, I think the difficulty of all the systems should increase with your level. That way you could return to liberty in a sabre and still be challenged while a level 1 ship would not be.(This was implemented in Privateer 2)
<br />Finally, if it is possible, the really unique and artistic stations seen in the E32001 trailer should be replaced.  They were awesome. I understand this might not be possible, but at least the first two suggestions would make the game more fun. 
<br />Last but not least..THANKS TO THE DEVELOPERS FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK&gt;&gt;YOU GIVEN US A GREAT GAME!</div>

			<div class="content">vogner,That sounds more like another game not Freelancer at all.What I would like to be incorporated in a patch is more along the lines of as Wing C3 had mentioned plus
<br />
<br />1.The ability for auto-turrets to not only be available in the game but also to turn them on or off in-game as an option.
<br />
<br />2.Different speeds for ships.
<br />
<br />3.Make the darn Corsair freighter available.
<br />
<br />4.Make all equipment available if your at the max. level since it is sort of unfair that the AI can have access to better equipment then the player. {e.g Champion &amp; Adv. champion gravitron shields}
<br />
<br />5.Shields for NPC's rejuvinate normally giving the player more than a challenge,since many say it is too easy &amp; also reduce the no.'s by 1/3 or 1/4 to compensate for game fighting balance issues.
<br />
<br />6.Blackholes
<br />
<br />7.More unknown system but make sure that they have relevance to there surroundings in that they would be occupied either by some other criminal faction or Nomads themselves instead of monkeys or robots.
<br /> 
<br />8.The SP campaign when finished should impact the universe around the player not a simple reset of the game.
<br />
<br />9.The ability to still receive missions from SP characters after the game or just to see them.
<br />
<br />
<br />Heh sounds more like an expansion patch or a really big mod but still within in patch circumstances.

			<div class="content">Yup definitely. Some of that stuff is an expansion pack type thing, but most of it seems quite reasonable. There are after all, a number of things that were once part of the game and were removed for performance issues such as some of the unique stations that can be seen in E32001 trailer. The game wasn't a complete reset, your liberty factions are, but I still remained very friendly with the dragons, GC, Lane Hackers, and at least neutral with the outcasts, corsairs, and rogues. I've since managed to make 18 of those friendly and EVERY one else neutral except the xenos. There are lots of things to mess around with...your rep is never exactly the same twice. There are soo many bases. Anyway...I would also love to see dynamic commodity pricing...that would make trading more interesting. If they had the technology to do it in privateer 1 and 2 then they can do it now. I remember that every now in then in the news boards you would see that one planet was having a plague and the price of medical supplies was up...that would be good in FL and the infrastructure is already in place...</div>
