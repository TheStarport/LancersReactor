			<div class="content">Hi all in LR World
<br />
<br />We run a 32 Player Jolt Uberserver Freelancer 1.1 server 
<br />
<br />It is a pass worded universe &amp; we only let in those who we think will play the game, the way it's meant to be played, ir lots of fun, no cheating or abuse.
<br />
<br />Our server is run on the same rule-set as the Jolt official server (and on the same spec Box) We are in the process of refining these rules, but only with feedback from the current players.
<br />
<br />We are currently inviting players &amp; clans to join our server for some permanent &amp; good spirited play. SGW don not run a FL clan as such but about 8 of our members from MoH &amp; BF1942 play regularly on it as well as quite a few individuals &amp; some small squads. The reason for posting this is not to step on Jolt's feet, but there FL server is over subscribed &amp; it doesn't look like they will put up another one for a while.
<br />
<br />As it is pass worded &amp; our admins monitor player levels we never intend to get it to the point where no peeps can get on. Once we are up to our estimated numbers then we will only admit more when some leave or accounts are severely inactive.
<br />
<br />For more information on the SGW server &amp; password applications then please visit our FL forums via our website @ <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.5thss.com">www.5thss.com</a><!-- w -->
<br />
<br />Applications from Clans must be made by the CO and specify player numbers etc.
<br />
<br />We are always looking to refine the play so if any have suggestions then again just post on our boards.  For the next few days the server will be left open for people to test drive
<br />
<br />See some of you out there.....
<br />
<br />195.149.21.24:2302
<br />
<br />And don't worry. We're very freindly 
<br />

			<div class="content">SGW Server Rules
<br />
<br />We are all aware that the gameplay possibilities of Freelancer make it extremely difficult to create a definitive set of rules and restrictions that everyone will be happy with. However, we as part of the Jolt Administration Staff will do everything we can to ensure the server is a fit place for everyone of all abilities to play the game on. 
<br />
<br />We understand the importance of having Player Vs Player (PvP) enabled on the server, both to promote teamwork and extend the lifetime of the game, so it will not be removed. However we feel certain restrictions are necessary to allow everyone to enjoy playing on our servers without feeling intimidated by more experienced players. 
<br />
<br />We have spent a great deal of time forming the following set of rules, which includes a code of conduct that players wishing to role play as pirates must abide by or face being kicked and possibly banned from the server. 
<br />
<br />As always, an admin will use his or her best judgement in deciding whether you have committed an offence and the severity of punishment to administer. 
<br />
<br />&amp;#8226; SGW General Rules &amp;#8226; 
<br />
<br />
<br />Cheating/Exploits 
<br />
<br />Cheating is defined as manipulating the game code to gain an unfair advantage over other players. This includes the use of map bugs and exploits. If you are caught cheating on our servers, or if cheats are detected on your computer, you will be banned on sight without warning. Jolt reserves the right to scan your hard drive for installed cheats when you use our servers. If you do not agree to this then you should not attempt to connect to any of our servers. Jolt has a zero tolerance policy for cheating and once you are banned you will not be unbanned. 
<br />
<br />Offensive Player Names 
<br />
<br />If you are caught using an offensive name we will kick you and erase your character from the server. Repeated attempts to use offensive names will result in you being globally banned from our service and servers. 
<br />
<br />Abusive Behaviour 
<br />
<br />If you are caught being abusive to other players we will globally ban you from our service and servers. People play the game for fun, they do not expect to receive abuse. If you act anti-socially, expect to be dealt with accordingly. 
<br />
<br />Racism 
<br />
<br />If you are caught making racist comments on our servers then we will globally ban you from our service and servers. We have a zero tolerance policy. Racism is not a joking matter, and we take it very seriously. 
<br />
<br />Crashing Servers 
<br />
<br />Deliberate interference in the running of servers, by using bugs to crash them or exploits is a very serious offence and we will not hesitate to globally ban you from our service and servers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&amp;#8226; Freelancer Rules &amp;#8226; 
<br />
<br />
<br />No PvP in New York 
<br />
<br />Players are not allowed to attack other players in the New York system under any circumstances. This is to give new players a chance to learn the game in relative safety. If you are caught attacking other players in this area you will be kicked and possibly banned from the server. 
<br />
<br />No PvP in Omicron Theta 
<br />
<br />No PvP is allowed in this area unless both parties agree to fight. Players that attack other players in this area without confirmation will be kicked and possibly banned from the server. 
<br />
<br />No spawn killing 
<br />
<br />You are not allowed to attack players as they undock. Players often have no chance of escape and can be killed repeatedly, which eventually forces them to leave the server. It is considered a flaw in the overall design of Freelancer and anyone engaged in such an activity will be banned on sight. 
<br />
<br />Engaging outnumbered or outclassed players 
<br />
<br />You are expected to use common sense when engaging other players. Attacking players that are significantly outnumbered and/or outclassed may result in you being kicked and possibly banned from the server. The admin will use his or her best judgement in deciding whether players have been unfairly killed and will take action accordingly. 
<br />
<br />Role playing as pirates 
<br />
<br />Players wishing to role play as pirates must abide by a set of rules known as the Pirate Code of Conduct (see Pirate Code of Conduct below for details). 
<br />
<br />Failure to abide by the terms in the code of conduct will subject you to a fine of $500,000 (credits, not real money) collectable by members of the Hunters Guild and server admins. 
<br />
<br />Repeated breaches of the code of conduct will result in your pirates licence being removed (your pirate character will be deleted). 
<br />
<br />Role playing as hunters 
<br />
<br />Players wishing to play as hunters must abide by the Hunters Code of Conduct (see Hunters Code of Conduct below for details). 
<br />
<br />Warning - Admins on Patrol! 
<br />
<br />Server admins are exempt from any tolls/taxes/mugging. We need access to every area in order to do our job, if someone is preventing us from doing our job we will prevent that person from playing. Simple. 
<br />
<br />Just so there is no confusion from people claiming to be admins, current admins are: Starkiller (me) &amp; Lord_Dubbd&#228;ck (Khold) 
<br />. 
<br />
<br />&amp;#8226; Pirate Code of Conduct &amp;#8226; 
<br />
<br />
<br />Players wishing to role play as pirates must abide by the Pirate Code of Conduct whilst using their pirate character. 
<br />
<br />Failure to abide by the terms in the code of conduct will subject you to a fine of $500,000 (credits, not real money) collectable by members of the Hunters Guild and server admins. 
<br />
<br />Repeated breaches of the code of conduct will result in your pirates licence being removed (your pirate character will be deleted). 
<br />
<br />
<br />Pirate Tag 
<br />
<br />Pirates must have the tag [Pirate or [X at the beginning or the end of their name. This is to let other players know your style of play so there is no confusion as to what your intentions are. You may use a clan tag in addition to the pirate tag. We understand that you will have to create a new character, however it is usually only a case of transferring some credits and weapons to your new character. 
<br />
<br />Pirate Activity Areas 
<br />
<br />Pirates are allowed to travel wherever they want, however pirate activity itself is only allowed in certain areas. Engaging in pirate activity outside of these areas will be considered a breach in the code of conduct. 
<br />
<br />Mugging/taxing/tolling and lane hacking are all considered pirate activity. 
<br />
<br />Pirate activity areas: 
<br />
<br />Omicron Alpha 
<br />
<br />Omicron Beta 
<br />
<br />Omicron Gamma 
<br />
<br />Omega 41 
<br />
<br />Omega 11 
<br />
<br />Omega 7 
<br />
<br />Omega 3 
<br />
<br />Tau 37 
<br />
<br />Tau 31 
<br />
<br />Tau 29 
<br />
<br />Tau 23 
<br />
<br />Chugoku 
<br />
<br />Hokkaido 
<br />
<br />Edinburgh 
<br />
<br />Dublin 
<br />
<br />Cortez 
<br />
<br />Magellan 
<br />
<br />Bering 
<br />
<br />Kepler 
<br />
<br />Galileo 
<br />
<br />
<br />Pirate Vs Pirate and Pirate Vs Hunter Exemption 
<br />
<br />Pirates are allowed to engage pirates and hunters regardless of level and number of group members as long as both parties are wearing their tags and it is not in a no PvP area such as New York and Omicron Theta. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&amp;#8226; Hunters Code of Conduct &amp;#8226; 
<br />
<br />
<br />Players wishing to play as hunters must abide by the Hunters Code of Conduct. 
<br />
<br />Hunters failing to abide by the code of conduct may find themselves being hunted down by their own kind. 
<br />
<br />Repeated breaches of the code of conduct will result in your hunters licence being removed (your hunter character will be deleted). 
<br />
<br />
<br />Hunter Tag 
<br />
<br />Hunters use the tag [Hunter. This is to let other players know your style of play so there is no confusion as to what your intentions are. You may use a clan tag in addition to the hunter tag. We understand that you will have to create a new character, however it is usually only a case of transferring some credits and weapons to your new character. 
<br />
<br />Hunter Vs Pirate and Pirate Vs Hunter Exemption 
<br />
<br />Hunters are allowed to engage pirates and pirates are allowed to engage hunters regardless of their level and number of group members as long as both parties are wearing their tags and it is not in a no PvP area such as New York and Omicron Theta.
