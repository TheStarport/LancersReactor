			<div class="content">It really just started doing this two days ago, and just enough to actually get me concerned. Even during idle time, my CPU usage will jump from 0-4 % (which is normal on this comp) up into the twenties, thirties and this morning up into the 80s and 90s. It lasts for about a second, then goes back down to the normal usage, but about three or four seconds later it does it again. I noticed it when I was playing WoW and would hang up every few seconds. Ever since then there hasn't been a period of more than ten minutes where it didn't do it. Now, I know that probably the most likely explination is my motherboard, which I'm getting a new one in January anyway and hopefully that'll fix this. However, I'm not sure that it's the motherboard and I'm also not sure how to find out. So, is there anything that I can do from here to check? I'm tempted to just do another backup and restore the factory defaults, but I'm not sure that'll fix it. 
<br />
<br />A few days ago my virus scanner (Stop-Sign which has served me well in the past) said that I had a virus on my comp that their automatic cleaner could not remove, and that it required a custom cleaner. A few days later I recieved the cleaner, and it says it got rid of the virus. I then did a scan and it came up clean. Last night I got AdAware, scanned it and had it remove a few suspicious files, scanned again and it came up clean as well. However, none of that fixed this, and it's really getting me concerned. 
<br />
<br />The reason I'm thinking it's my mobo is because my comp has been doing other weird stuff reciently. I'd go to delete a file off my desktop, and when the window came up showing the progress the bar would either stay empty or become full, and just stay like that. It wouldn't close automatically like it should, and I'd either have to hit cancel or X out to close the window. And now when I try to shut down it literally takes ten minutes. If I go to start and then shut down, it takes five minutes to pull up the window asking if I want to restart, log off or shut down, and if I select restart or shut down it then takes five more minutes to actually do it.
<br />
<br />Like I said I think it's my motherboard, but I don't know that it is and I'm not sure how to find out. Here's the dxdiag info. (Sorry for the long post but I wasn't sure what of all this I could get rid of to shorten it. I didn't want to remove something you may wanted to take a look at.

			<h3><a href="#p417328" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">it might be your motherboard, but more probably it's software related, the result of viral/trojan or spyware/malware activity. 
<br />
<br />update your AV and do a full scan on drive C: including the memory areas, startup objects, mailboxes etc. You must let this finish. Quarantine or delete anything that it finds. Personally I'd recommend changing your AV suite to Kaspersky, F-prot, or Macafee, as I know that they're all very, very good.
<br />
<br />update Ad-Aware to the latest build and definitions then run a full scan, not a smart scan. Quarantine or delete everything that it finds.
<br />
<br />run a registry cleaner throug the system, Norton Windoctor, CCleaner, Registry Mechanic, they're all good. Fix everything they find.
<br />
<br />Now, here's the harder part (it's not really hard though) Delete the <i>contents </i>, and <i>not </i> the directories themselves, of the following locations:-
<br />
<br />C:\Documents and Settings\<i>your account name </i>\Local Settings\Temp\*.*
<br />C:\Windows\Temp\*.*
<br />C:\Temp\*.* (but you may not have this directory anyway)
<br />C:\Windows\Prefetch, except for the file layout.ini which you must keep.
<br />
<br />and then empty all this cr*p out of the Recycler, you don't need it and viruses/trojans love it.
<br />
<br />rather more involved now - look at the stuff that's running in your system tray and decide if you need it or not. Printer utilities, various &quot;smartstart&quot; programs, multimedia apps, ad-supported rubbish like Gator and Bonzi Buddi, you don't need any of it. To stop it running, go to start, run, and type &quot;msconfig,&quot; go to the startup tab and untick all the ones you don't need. Also disable MS-Office as a startup item as it's a resource hogger and doesn't do anything remotely useful.
<br />
<br />That might take a bit of trial and error as it's not always obvious what the various bits and pieces in Startup relate to! 
<br />
<br />And defrag - I use Diskeeper, not Windows Defrag, but the bundled one is ok if you haven't got anything else.
<br />
<br />Now then, I would advise that <b>before you start all this stuff, you create a system restore point, then DISABLE System Restore - why? because many many trojans and nasty bits of code love System Restore and make their homes there, happily hiding from many virus scanners only to pop back up when the scans over or the system rebooted. You shouldn't have System Restore on while doing this kind of diagnostic and repair work, it should only go back on when you're happy you've sorted the problem(s.) But if you created a restore point, at least you'll have something to go back to if you mess it all up! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />You might also want to check the obvious things in your BIOS, no shadow functions on, everything set to PNP, caches enabled, sufficient video aperture. 
<br />
<br />Incidentally are you using a firewall other than the XP one? And is this pc networked to other pcs in the house? </b></div>

			<div class="content">Great advice Taw, but you forgot about fixing windows files. They may have been damaged when he removed the virus. Killa Right click your C drive then go to properties,Tools then Error-Checking and put a check mark in automatically fix file system errors. Don't check the second one unless you have alot of time to kill. Now reboot and let it do its thing.

			<div class="content">From one hp Pavillion user to another...
<br />
<br />remove, reformatt and reinstall. done
<br />The &quot;Surge&quot; you see in CPU activity means something is definately running in the background...sometimes it's a program trying to access the internet. 
<br />In your Task Manager, you'll notice that surge in CPU Performance is most likely linked with some Process that appears briefly and then dissappears. It can be hard to catch and find out what it is. 
<br />
<br />I recently had a problem with my anti-virus program causing just exactly the same shut down problems. After contacting Norton about it, they told me what I needed to change to fix that. That did the trick (at least for this pc) .
<br />
<br />If you have a built in Recovery Partition: (I'm sure you have one)
<br />Turn off System Restore so you don't reinstall any unwanted nasty stuff by accident. (Viruses and such love the Restore function, so turn it off until you're reformatted back to factory settings)
<br />Save what you want to keep to a separate CD, DVD, HD backup device. (Before loading it back onto your newly formatted Hard Drive....you'll need to scan them with the anti-virus program)
<br />Then do a complete full destructive system recovery (recovers to original factory default settings)
<br />(Restart, press F1 or F-something to go into Recovery operations)
<br />After Recovery is accomplished, you'll need to reinstall your anti virus program and get it's definitions back up to date. I stayed with Norton since it came with mine. But I got rid of my spy ware detectors since they also mucked up some essential programs.
<br />
<br />Normally, the recovery partition is left alone by &quot;bugs&quot;...but if they ever get into the recovery partition...you're screwed. If they get into the Boot system...the same results. 
<br />Only option then is to take it to a PC specialist..unless you really know what you're doing.
<br />
<br />If things are really running slower than usual...that means something else is using up your cpu. It could be a bug or a bunch of programs running in the background that you really don't need to have running. 
<br />If possible, consult with HP service support (1-800-474-6836) to find out what basic programs are needed to keep your hp running quick and smoothly.  Something like 12 basic programs that are determined in the msconfig settings.
<br />(Believe it or not..once I took one PC off line and removed the antivirus program..it ran incredibly faster...but it stays off line)
<br />
<br />I've lost count of the number of times I've done a full destructive recovery. But I've gotten better. LOL (That's one of the things I love about hp..its very forgiving of my muckups)

<br />it doesn't sound like file and directory structure stuff to me at all, although I'm sure they're damaged as well by now. it sounds far more like registry corruption and runaway processes caused by viral/trojan damage. I see this all the time from the nuggets who whine that their laptop or pc isn't working, then I go along and find that they've been downloading loads of rubbish that's trouncing their machine. it's invariably some adware/spyware riddled tripe they've ignorantly downloaded despite all my warnings to the contrary. They never admit it, not at first anyway; I always get &quot;it just started&quot; or some other excuse, then on further investigation (usually armed with security audit log as evidence) I'll extract a confession of &quot;so-and-so told me to go to this site&quot; or &quot;so-and-so installed this for me&quot; which invariably means I get to restrict someone else's account rights <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> there's always a dark cloud to every silver lining.....
<br />
<br />wipe the thing with your recovery disk. might as well, at least it gets the pain over with. I have <i>never </i> used a recovery disk to fix a pc! only to repartition and reformat/reinstall after machines have returned from their deployment as something else (UNIX terminals or NT Workstations, for example)</div>

			<div class="content">Well, either that AdAware has gotten rid of some of that crap that was causing this, or this is the calm before the storm. The last few days my comp has been acting normally. The CPU usage line doesn't look like a heart monitor for someone in cardiac arrest, and my programs haven't been hanging up (WoW is running just as smoothly as it always has, although that's really the only game I've played for the past week.) My processes are at 52 right now, the normal number as it's been 51 or 52 for as long as I can remember. I haven't shut down in the last few days, so I don't know if that's back to normal, but other than that it's working fine again. (All I've done was get AdAware and have it remove some critical objects that Stop-Sign missed.) I have an uncle who's a comp expert that lives near me, so if/when I have to do the reformating, I'll have him do it. (He actually knows what he's doing.)</div>

<br />Respects to you;
<br />
<br />He's using an hp (Hewlett Packard) machine that has a built in recovery partition on a hard drive..just like mine. There is no separate &quot;recovery disk&quot; for these machines.
<br />If you format the whole disk, you destroy the machines built in recovery capability which is a very bad idea for this type machine. If that is done, the only recourse would be to order the disks direct from Hewlett Packard. However, the machine will never be the same once this is done. Trust me.
<br />Hp was very diligent when they built these pc's with this capability to ensure that the pc can &quot;repair&quot; itself with as little outside intervention as possible.
<br />
<br />On a more serious note:
<br />If something goes wrong with the system that even &quot;Destructive Recovery&quot; cannot fix, it is by far a more prudent thing to take the pc to a repair specialist.
<br />Preferably to a certified Hewlett Packard repair specialist in this case.
<br />
<br />The registry is one of those areas that you don't want to go mucking around if you don't know what you're doing and don't know what to look for. Screwing around with that can lead to nearly irreparable damage. But for sure, screwing around with the recovery partition will surely lead to irreparable damage that only an special order recovery disk might be able to fix.
<br />It is best to refer to the Hewlett Packard Specialists to avoid making serious mistakes on this type machine.</div>

			<div class="content">yes I know about the recovery partition. I immediately delete it on every HP machine that crosses my path, as i don't want my users even knowing that it exists. They have an IT dept (i.e. me) to fix these problems for them, and (trust me) every single time I've ever let them try to fix something themselves with a recovery disk or recovery partition, even if it's just to extract a driver, it's been a disaster and they lose all their work and e-mails. So in my experience, it's a terrible idea; it's purely to serve HPs purposes in reducing turnaround times of their outsourced technical support SLAs, by forcing the uneducated to reset the machine back to it's original state, in the process losing everything they've done in the meantime (but HP's SLAs class that as a fix.) Dreadful idea and should never have been invented.</div>

			<div class="content">Taw,
<br />I can see you keep your herd in check and I don't blame you there. I guess there can be nothing worse than a network full of rookies trying to fix their own workstations especially when they don't know anything about hp's.
<br />That's job security for IT experts like you!
<br />However, for pc end users like killa and me, we tend to need that extra padding the recovery partition gives us and if we're careful...we survive till the next wave of lunacy that strikes us. 
<br />We on the end of the line have to learn (sometimes the hard way) what we have to avoid to keep our pc's running smoothly.
<br />All the spy ware detectors, the anti-virus programs and anti-intrusion software adds up to no better than a hill of beans if we first don't mind our own activities with our own pc's as we use the internet.</div>
