			<div class="content">OK, I have a few bones to pick with Microsoft .
<br />
<br />#1: SINGLE PLAYER ISSUES
<br />Don't get me wrong, the story was excellent, but it's too short and needs to be longer. Not to mention, the entire storyline, I had to follow it exactly, there was no 'Decide which way you want to go'. Not only is there only one path, it's not really that long. The story ended abruptly and now there is nothing left to do save do missions for stupid bases. Where's the rest of the singleplayer game? (lets wait for the $50 expansion pack!). There needs to be a choice of what you do. I'm talking something like instead of the starting mission being Juni and King on Manhattan there is other people on other planets with storylines as intricate.
<br />
<br />There's not enough realism. Every time I go into a battle, it's everyone vs me, no matter how many damn allies I have. I get pulled over by Hessians demanding my 20 Food Rations when there's a freighter with a million diamonds not more then 1K away. Where's the justice? I want to be the guy who drives the damn battleship.
<br />
<br />#2: MULTI PLAYER
<br />
<br />Can I stress the importance of variety in multiplayer? Here's a few ideas:
<br />
<br />a) Escort missions -- Escort freighters or VIP's to a destination, very basic, easy missions to begin with that would get harder as you venture out into the border worlds.
<br />
<br />b) Commodity -- I see in the spoiler forums 'BEST TRADE ROUTE EVER'. This is what happens: everyone takes the 'best trade route' to get millions of dollars and the game becomes less based around Freelancing and more based around going from one place to another and back and forth and back and forth and buying and selling. There's no variety there. It's all one spot to another. How about factors that affect the buy/sell price of a commodity at a station? the &quot;Trade Routes&quot; button would give you current prices of the bases. After your sale of a million Diamonds to a base, obviously they would pay less for Diamonds to other bidders.
<br />Not only would this make the multiplayer game alot more interactive, it would make the game harder and take longer.
<br />
<br />c) Exploration -- OK. I have a Sabre. I've had a Titan and pretty much all of the other ships. I have four nomad cannons equipped, a Sunslayer Torp, ultimate mines and missiles. Spare, I have about a million nomad cannons and blasters. I have seen pretty much every star system and I can't find anything that I haven't been to. Everything in the spoiler forum spoilt nothing except my attitude at this game being so easily beatable.
<br />
<br />#3: THINGS I CANT FIGURE OUT
<br />
<br />Ok, what the hell is the Monkey faction and how do I get them to sell me things? What about the damn Robots? I'm friends with the Samura but the Monkeys wont even sell me shield batterys? Not like it matters because I take down two Nomads per pass. (You know, it being way too easy and all). The only thing I can't do is figure out (a) how to get to that Unknown Object in Tau-37 (b) what the hell the unknown system with the sun does (c) where the hell the nomad's base is and (d) how to find ships that can beat me.
<br />
<br />#4: THINGS I REALLY HATE ABOUT THIS GAME
<br />
<br />How the hell do you kill a battleship? Can you even kill a battleship? I'm sitting there launching Sunslayer after Sunslayer and pounding it with nomad lasers, killing all of the turrets and attacking the engine, It says 'Battleships killed' but I can't kill one! What about killing freighters? Why can't I be like the Hessians and demand cargo from freighters?
<br />
<br />There should be a Criminals Campaign as well as working for the liberty navy. what if i decided to take off and go to Leeds? What would I do there? NOTHING. THERE IS NOTHING TO DO ANYWHERE EXCEPT FOR MANHATTAN. Where the hell is the Bretonian Army? Don't they need another wingman to hang out with their commanders?
<br />
<br />The multiplayer game isn't enough like the single player game. It's totally open. There needs to be more of a single-player feel to the multiplayer game. You should be able to join in with Juni+King but instead of doing the single-player mission  exactly like the single-player mission it should be an ongoing problem. It would add alot more to the realism. In the multiplayer game I never see any systems attacking other systems or trying to take over a planet or venturing into unknown systems.
<br />
<br />Why does everyone start at Manhattan? Let us start somewhere else. How about a random starting location from Kusari Rheinland Liberty Bretonia? How about you let me be an Outcast? Where's the outcast missions?
<br />
<br />This game is nothing but kill kill kill. All the missions are SEEK AND KILL. Everything is SEEK AND KILL. How about something else except killing? Like exploring?!?!?! Maybe you should get put on missions to explore or patrol? I mean come on. The only mission I ever get is 'Go to Sector 0X and kill ships. kill them all'.
<br />
<br />How about another sector besides Sirius? It's kind of boring. I've been everywhere (or have i?) How about those Unknown Universes? Where do they lead? Maybe there should be another jumphole to another sector.
<br />
<br />It needs to be easier for the server admin to make the game longer. I want to be able to spend 10 billion dollars on buying that 2000000 cargospace freighter. The best ship i can find costs only $700000.. and thats a fighter. the freighter is tiny.
<br />
<br />Feel free to add to my frustration or even answer a few of my questions. I'd love to know where otherpeople have gotten up to cause I sure as hell feel like I've been everywhere and back twice.
<br />
<br />aspirationz.

<br />In the Single Player, I'm getting a lot more fun out of this by ignoring the SP campaign and doing my own thing while things are hard, instead of rushing through it and then having the best of everything.

			<div class="content">I think the game is great. It could be alot better, but what game couldn't. It's still a great game, I'm having a blast. I've probably played about 40-hours, and I'm only level 15, still playing the Single Player Campaign, and haven't seen even half of the systems supposedly out there.
<br />
<br />I love the variety in the look of all the new and different systems that I visit. Some are full of dust, some full of debris, some of asteroids, some colorfull with different gases, some pitch black and you can see galaxies far, far away, etc.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, I forgot....and I've only flown three different ships so far.............I see hundreds of hours of play ahead of me!

			<div class="content">I figured out how to find jump holes and become friends with the enemy and now any time i want to go  somewhere no matter if i am friends or enemies with them i can be on the other side of the map and best friends with the enemy.. It's really easy, there really needs to be another sector
<br />
<br />Only level 38 ships can get to this sector, it is possible to go back but anything obtained from the new system is destroyed on the way back (you know the drill). Levels need to be pretty much infinate and based more on experience/ship rather than money/cargo/ship.. i was level 38 in a matter of hours after i  started playing this game and now i want another challenge, how about a sector where nomads is the dominate side?
<br />
<br />'Hail': This is Faction. I am from Planet. I am going to Planet.
<br />
<br />So radio was invented to let people know where you're going? How about some interactivity like a &quot;Want to be allies?&quot; &quot;YES/NO/ATTACK&quot; sort of thing. Trading commodities needs to be more focused on player-trading rather than base selling. Bases seem to have infinate money and commodities.. it's rather set.
<br />
<br />Also an issue relating to commodities: WHY CAN'T WE USE THEM? HERE IS AN EXAMPLE:
<br />
<br />H-Fuel: When set to 'use commodity' setting, H-Fuel does exactly what it's sposed to. Increases thrusters and efficiency ETC. but uses 1 h-fuel per 15 sec or someth.
<br />Oxygen: you need oxygen to go to some planets? here's where it comes into play
<br />Food Rations: Trent needs to eat. Eat Trent Eat.
<br />Water: Drink Water. It's another thing that Trent needs.
<br />luxury food: satisfies trent's hunger more then the average food rations
<br />
<br />These are all great ideas .. right? I hope someone takes me seriously because I think it's a good idea. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
