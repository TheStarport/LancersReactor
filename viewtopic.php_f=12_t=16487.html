<br />
<br />( and yes im spamming )
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The Bastard Operator from Hell is back ... 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />So I'm in my office again, reconfiguring the router when the phone rings. Somehow I knew this was going to happen. I'm obviously going to have to change my number (and Operator) YET AGAIN. 
<br />I pick it up. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Start talking.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Is this the network engineer?&quot; 
<br />
<br />Sigh. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes it is,&quot; I say, resigned to my fate. 
<br />
<br />I check the phone - there's no corresponding name on caller ID, which can only mean one thing. 
<br />
<br />&quot;You're new here aren't you?&quot; I ask. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, how did you know?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Lucky guess. Tell me, how did you get my number?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, I just called the helpdesk.&quot; 
<br />
<br />How helpful of them.. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Anyway, I was just ringing to tell you that you've got a problem with the network.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;No,&quot; I answer, &quot;no problems here.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;You do have a problem - I can't get my PC to work.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's just look at this logically,&quot; I say. &quot;You can't get your PC to work, so I have a problem.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;With the network, yes. It's probably a loose connector somewhere.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Of all the things that REALLY piss me off, the 'loose connector' and 'loose wire' theories TOP the queue. He obviously thinks that my day consists of sitting in a comms room somewhere 'wiggling loose wires' to improve network services. Or that I designed the network by calling up a cable supplier and ordering several drums of CAT-5 and asking for it to be &quot;scattered about the building in a spider web shape&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Next thing I know he'll be telling me that maybe one of the 'bulbs' burnt out on my FDDI ring. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, maybe one of the bulbs..&quot; 
<br />
<br />A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, it's not that! You've kicked out your patch cable,&quot; I say. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I can't have!&quot; he backpeddles. 
<br />
<br />&quot;You've kicked out your patch cable.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, all the wires are securely plugged into the back of my PC...&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;You've kicked out your patch cable.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;...and they all go to the box in the flo.. Oh, hey! I kicked out the patch cable!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course you did. It happens all the time. It's because the twisted pairs in your cable get tangled, shortening the effective length of the cable. It's just like the telephone cord when it gets tangled.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh right! I think I read something about that..&quot; he burbles. What a plonker. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Is there anything I can do to stop it?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, all you need to do is unplug it from the floor socket and give the cable a really really hard yank. Then all the twisted pairs come into line.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;But won't that damage my machine?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Heck no! The connector at the other end is made to pop out when the strain might damage the cable!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;OK, here goes...&quot; 
<br />
<br />CRASH!! 
<br />
<br />&quot;HEY! I PULLED MY MACHINE ONTO THE FLOOR AND A BOARD'S RIPPED OUT OF THE BACK OF IT!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh well, you obviously pulled too hard,&quot; I say calmly. 
<br />
<br />&quot;WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? IT'S MY FIRST DAY!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know,&quot; I reply. &quot;It sounds to me like a hardware problem. I'm just a network engineer..&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;But...&quot; 
<br />
<br />I hang up. It's time to have stern words with the helpdesk. First step, into the comms room to 'wiggle their wires around' and drop out their network. Step two, set their call-forwarding so all their calls go through to the boss. 
<br />
<br />I pick a floor at random and remote boot both the main and redundant routers. 
<br />
<br />REQUEST LINES ARE NOW OPEN! 
<br />
<br />Scant seconds later I hear the boss's phone ringing. I'll give the boss about 10 minutes of irate users, then wander round and suggest the helpdesk staff need a lesson on what's funny and what's not. Forwarding your phone to the boss at network failure ISN'T funny. Helpdesk personnel investigating the job market IS. 
<br />
<br />My thoughts are interrupted by a call on the Red 'Bat' Phone. It's obviously the boss. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Is this the network engineer?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;It certainly is, how can I be of help?&quot; I crawl. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, you've got a problem with your network.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Have we?&quot; (grease grease). 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I guess it's probably a loose wire somewhere..&quot; 
<br />
<br />Sigh. 
<br />
<br />He'll have to go.. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />The Bastard trips up ... 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />&quot;So what you're saying is that the network is wide open to hackers?&quot; the boss asks. 
<br />The department Brown-Nose nods. I, however, shake my head. 
<br />
<br />Guess who he believes? 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, what have you been doing about these security holes?&quot; asks the boss, now more than a little concerned. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah...&quot; 
<br />
<br />I consider the topic carefully for almost a nano-second prior to providing my answer. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Not a thing.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;But our network is wide open. The security implications are horrendous!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;That is correct,&quot; I say. &quot;My much maligned co-'worker' has hit the nail right on the side with his diagnosis of our situation, which I will now attempt to summarise. 
<br />
<br />&quot;In the unlikely even that someone manages to pick both the seven-pin tumbler locks on one of the comms room doors, bypass the alarm systems and security cameras, then open the locked FDDI cage, or alternatively, smash their way through six inches of reinforced concrete piping buried four feet under a busy suburban road, then tap into our fibre-optic cable without us knowing...then yes, we are wide open. 
<br />
<br />&quot;However, if as I surmise this is a thinly disguised ploy by the departmental Brown-Nose to edge his way one rung up the perk ladder into a trip to look at new security software, then I believe that our exposure to danger is somewhat overstated.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Did you say trip?&quot; the boss asks, eyes gleaming. 
<br />
<br />EVERY TIME A COCONUT! 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; Brown-Nose chips in innocently. &quot;Just to a manufacturer in the US who has some software to quadrupally encrypt data streams while retaining data integrity and not impacting bandwidth.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Of course, as soon as the word 'US' pops up the boss has visions of himself overseeing the 'evaluation' procedure at a convenient beach, staying at the nearest resort because of its central placing. 
<br />
<br />Right. 
<br />
<br />Brown-Nose smirks as his dreams of a holiday on the company come to full fruition. 
<br />
<br />It seems almost a crime to take his dreams and strike them with the iron bar of reality, but network engineering is a dirty job... 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, that really does sound like a good idea. However, I believe that there is some quintupally encrypting software with a manufacturer who is presently on a six-week tour of the States that I'd already lined-up a meeting with.&quot; 
<br />
<br />To add to the impact of my statement, I flash a sheet of paper with impressive writing and letterhead as proof. They are not to know that it is in fact from my lawyer who is attempting to defend me from some libellous allegations of an illegal wiretap at my previous workplace (a sordid blackmail allegation completely fabricated by some other employees who were jealous of my six figure salary and my five minute working day). 
<br />
<br />Flashing the paper at this stage is of course unnecessary, as the boss wants to believe this... 
<br />
<br />I tip him the 'junket-nod' with: 
<br />
<br />&quot;Hopefully we'll be able to catch up with them as they had booking problems and had to review their venues and dates.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Now the boss has carte blanche at junket level. His two options are either he goes with Brown-Nose to the States for a brief holiday with a small amount of technical content, or he goes to the States with me, expenses-paid for five weeks, never quite catching the manufacturer, returning home empty handed and still needing to find some encryption software (in other words, up for another junket), no technical content, with the minor danger of alcoholic poisoning. 
<br />
<br />Choose the first option and Brown-Nose will wilt under their respective inspections. 
<br />
<br />The Boss smiles. I smile. We both smile. 
<br />
<br />Brown-Nose sobs - he knows what's on the cards. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course,&quot; I say &quot;we don't really want to muddy the waters of purchasing and spread ourselves too thinly in researching this. A small team to concentrate on the hardware should do.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Engage cover-up plan. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; the boss concurs knowingly, &quot;.. too many cooks and all that. Some technical reshuffle seems called for... I hear there's an opening for a technical consultant in our site maintenance division in Hartlepool.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Tears well up in Brown-Nose's eyes as he contemplates his next five years of gardening and rubbish bin emptying... 
<br />
<br />&quot;That will do nicely sir. Book the tickets now?&quot; 
<br />
<br />I try not to think of it as spite, just seeing the job through to completion. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The Bastard gives advice ... 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />I'm preparing for a six-week US junket on the company with the boss to look at new comms gear. This means I'm going to have to take on someone to do my job while I'm away. 
<br />The ex-office brown-nose applied for the position, but unfortunately he was late for his interview when the lift in which he was a passenger mysteriously blew a control breaker. A pity they didn't discover him till after the weekend, by which time he was a drooling vegetable. It all adds fuel to my argument that I require a larger 'miscellaneous' budget to employ part-time staff to check things like lift emergency telephones and alarm switches. 
<br />
<br />As far as the job went, within a couple of days I have a 'green and keen' contractor occupying the spare desk. Now to teach him the ropes... 
<br />
<br />&quot;OK quick outline, we look after every communications entity in the building. And they all belong to me. Not the user. Me. Remember that, it's important!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;They belong to you.&quot; he repeats 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, never say that. Always say, they belong to 'ME'. You don't want to give the users the idea that comms is something they should get involved in.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;They belong to me. So we look after phones as well?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Phones, fire and intruder alarms, intercoms, networks, microwave link, miscellaneous control systems; hell, if they bought semaphore flags we'd probably be looking after them,&quot; I say, pointing out the respective chapters in my site management bible. 
<br />
<br />&quot;How do you get away with it?&quot; he asks. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Simple. I apply the basic rule of standardisation. Everything gets done in a standard way, and no-one but me knows anything about it.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;It's all in your head?...&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, no. It's all copiously documented in that safe over there,&quot; I reply, indicating a large armageddon-proof box in the corner. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Who has access to it?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Me.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;And your boss..?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;He has a key that he likes to think will open it. In actual fact, it's a duplicate of the key to the CEO's wine safe in the basement.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Does the boss know?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;How could he. He's not allowed in either area.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;He's not allowed in here?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course not. He's management and this is a sensitive area. Standardisation, remember. Just mention to the CEO that we have phone-tap equipment and you get a fat security budget to play with.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Aren't you worried the boss will find out about the key?&quot; my employee asks. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Not as worried as he'd be when I mention informing the CEO about it. There's been a surprising amount of pilfering going on. It wouldn't look good on his permanent record when he went looking for his next job...&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What a tragedy. Okay, I've got all that, what do I do?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Nothing, I've done it all. Familiarise yourself with the site management bible. It'll tell you all the major problems that could befall us, what to do and who to contact. See that phone on your desk - don't ever answer it, it'll just be some user who's moved his machine and expects the data-sockets to be live.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;That's it?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Like I said, it's mostly in the site bible. Oh, remember to put the voice recorder tapes into the fireproof back-up safe!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;That's in case we have a verbal contract disagreement?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, that's so I can listen to the boss's personal phone calls. Honestly, it's better than 'Days of Our Lives'. Also, never mention the name 'Pooky' or he'll know I'm onto him.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;OK, what if the helpdesk corners me?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Hmmm. Well, as I haven't introduced you to them, you've got a week's grace. After that, use the excuse that you can't accept helpdesk calls until you have a username to receive the email so that the process can be tracked by me when I return. That'll buy you another couple of days. Add two more days for documentation on paper and then you might squeeze yet another week or two out if you use the old routine 'log a fault call' - preferably on some ancient noticeboard using the tried and trusted postcard method. Remember to make some number up and write it on the incident board as 'proof'. When you can't delay any more, use the network monitor to drop the CEO's data ports. He has priority and you can kill at least a day 'isolating the failure'.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What happens if the CEO corners me?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Play it safe and brown-nose. Get him a coffee and take him on a tour of the central comms room. When he's mesmerised by the flashing lights, nudge his arm when you open a cabinet door so that the coffee spills through the floor tiles. The master breaker will pop so fast he won't even have time to say 'woopsy'. After that, no-one's going to complain about anything. Got all that?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Sorted!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Right, get to work.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
<br />The Bastard gets non-PC 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />So I'm in the States with Sharon, the ex-boss's secretary, to check out some new networking hardware and software. The boss couldn't make it after unfortunately having a disagreement with the CEO when the CEO somehow got 'listen-only conferenced' into a telephone call between the boss and the CEO's wife. (The bit about the boardroom table got to him apparently). Being the only other person familiar with the whole deal, Sharon, a young, part-time aerobics instructor and non-subscriber to the motto &quot;Don't screw the crew&quot;, was obliged to accompany me. 
<br />What a tragedy. 
<br />
<br />Strangely, it couldn't have worked out better if it were planned. (You know, someone telling Sharon to familiarise herself with only 10 of the 1000 or so documents that pass over her desk every month; someone accidentally tampering with the exchange configuration to allow listen-only conference calls; someone tampering with the exchange to make it auto conference calls to the CEO's home number back to the CEO's private phone that no-one but his secretary has the number to...) But of course, that's ridiculous. 
<br />
<br />Of course I blame myself. If I hadn't taken the boss for a 'working lunch', bought him 10 pints and mentioned the CEO's wife had a fixation on him, perhaps none of this would have happened. 
<br />
<br />Sigh. Oh well, at least I did my duty by the firm and made the most of it; difficult though it was. I must remember that at contract renegotiation time. 
<br />
<br />We book in at a modestly priced hotel - (modest by the standards of the Royal Family that is) and suffer an upgrade in rooms when it is discovered that due to some computing glitch a Mr Babbage and a Mr Pascal have been double-booked in our economy rooms. It's funny the number of times that has happened to me... 
<br />
<br />I ring my temp to see how he's doing in my absence. The phone rings about 50 times before finally being diverted to talking clock. At least I know he's read my Site Management Bible... 
<br />
<br />I then ring the boss's temporary replacement from the bar. 
<br />
<br />&quot;How's it going?&quot; he asks keenly, disguising the fact that he's annoyed at not being here. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we're having some trouble tracking down the supplier's tour dates, but we figure we'll track them down through computing magazines. Speaking of which, can you wire me another thousand quid for...miscellaneous expenses - the computing magazines, phone calls etc.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I sure can,&quot; he replies amiably. &quot;Of course, you'll be bringing these magazines back with you when you return so our accountant can rectify all this with the bean counters upstairs?&quot; 
<br />
<br />Sneaky bastard - he's just upset that he didn't get to go and is obviously going to cause problems. Best to nip this in the bud right now. 
<br />
<br />&quot;No problem - could you make that three thousand quid, the air freight costs are likely to be quite high for the 250 odd magazines...&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Perhaps that IS unnecessary,&quot; he says, thinking about his plummeting operations budget. 
<br />
<br />&quot;OK. Well I'll get back to you in a couple of days,&quot; I reply. 
<br />
<br />He hangs up and immediately I whip back to my room and dial through to my private modem pool at work. 
<br />
<br />I wait 10 minutes for the temp-boss to type and print the expense memo, then ethersniff his text and digitised signature on its way to the printer. I quickly bash up another expense report for a couple of hundred quid requesting some 'photographic' magazines from a dealer in Amsterdam appending his home address as the delivery point. I 'accidentally' queue it to print at Bean-Counting-Brown-Nose-Central then logout. 
<br />
<br />Knowing the religious background of the CEO I expect to find yet another empty desk on my return. Just applying the first law of networking - loose ends are bad, termination is good. 
<br />
<br />To enhance my job security, I make another phone call to a number that's permanently etched into my memory. In a darkened comms cupboard on the 5th floor, the call is answered by a 'Home Security Dialup Unit' and I type in my pin number. Then type a three-digit code and hang up. The clock starts now. 
<br />
<br />Six minutes and twelve seconds later the phone rings. The helpdesk has found me which can only mean that the temp-boss has given out my contact number, which in turn must mean the CEO is displeased. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Something's wrong with the network!&quot; the operator cries. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I see. Put me on hands-free and tell me what's going on,&quot; I reply in a business-like manner. 
<br />
<br />The earpiece tells me I'm on hands-free, speaking to, if my calculations are correct, the helpdesk operator, the temp boss and the CEO (who likes to be around when major panics are in session to get firsthand knowledge of what the problem really is). 
<br />
<br />&quot;What's the problem?&quot; I repeat. 
<br />
<br />&quot;The network appears to be bridged out somewhere in the computer room.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;OK, have you looked at the network topology in the documentation cabinet?&quot; I ask, playing the knowledgeable and helpful network-person to the hilt. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Your temp's trying to get into his office but there appears to be a lockout on the comms room swipe-card lock.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Really? It sounds suspiciously like we've dropped a breaker in the distributed UPS Unit.&quot; 
<br />
<br />No-one has a clue what I'm talking about at this stage, but they also don't want to appear ignorant. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh huh,&quot; the help desk operator says (probably accompanied by en-masse nodding in the room). 
<br />
<br />&quot;OK, call the operations room, tell them to open the third UPS cabinet from the left, and they'll find a breaker, number 15 or 16, has tripped. If they reset that, the computer room repeater should come back to life and the door access system should start communicating with the office again...&quot; 
<br />
<br />Five minutes later I'm back in the bar, with one of the safest contracts since Al Capone was alive. The CEO thinks I know each circuit breaker personally, and that my temp will have to go as soon as I get back. Situation Under Control. 
<br />
<br />Good networking depends on good planning. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The Bastard on a devilish buying mission ... 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The story so far... The Bastard Operator from Hell and his ex boss's secretary Sharon are on a fact-finding mission to the States to check out on some security hardware ... 
<br />Sharon and I have to make the junket look more plausible so I track down several trade-shows for us to go to and pad out our cover story. I use the basic two-step junket cover-up plan: 
<br />
<br />1. Drop business cards saying I'm interested in everything so I get lots of correspondence when I get back. 
<br />
<br />2. Sign up for every free subscription and on-site demonstration (to be farmed off to someone once I get home). 
<br />
<br />I then engage the one-step Make The Most Of It Plan - get to the bar as soon as possible and get freebies and drinks from suppliers. 
<br />
<br />Later that day at a sales stand... 
<br />
<br />&quot;..combined with dual, redundant power delivery systems, opto-mode indicators, and rapid install strain relief fixtures&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;So what you're saying is it comes with a spare power cable, a 'power' LED and a bag of cable ties?&quot; I ask. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah well, you're obviously not aware of the full ramifications of system redundancy, hardware stressors and high availability.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;IT'S A BLOODY ROUTER!&quot; I shout. &quot;If the power goes out, it doesn't matter how many spare power cables, lights or cable ties you have, it still stops, you lose your net and get lots of phone calls!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, but it does come in a nice black case with eight rubber feet instead of four!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;WHAT I'M AFTER,&quot; I repeat for the fifth time &quot;is an FDDI hub with IMPRESSIVE LOOKING ENCRYPTION built-in. I don't need another router.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;It's a nice router..&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't care, I have routers. I want IMPRESSIVE LOOKING ENCRYPTION!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What do you mean by impressive LOOKING?&quot; the guy asks. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Something that'll fool a technical manager,&quot; I reply. 
<br />
<br />&quot;What about converting everything to lower case?&quot; he suggests, knowing the level of competence of the average technical manager. 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, no we might get an intelligent one sometime in the future.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Lowercase and all words spelt backwards?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Better..&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we do have this encryption chip set for terminal servers that we could whack into a hub..&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What sort of speed would we get?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;FDDI in.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;And out?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;96K.. ...on a good day.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;NOT really what I want is it?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, that would be version one. But we promise that version 1.1 would have perfect performance, no lag, and so secure it'll seem like magic.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;You're lying aren't you?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course, I'm in sales!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What would we really get?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Like I said, version 1.1 would have the lot - everything you asked for.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;When would it be delivered?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Third quarter.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Third quarter?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;2012.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Thought so. Perhaps we give this one a miss?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;But it's the only hub on the market with high-speed-opto-interfacing!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;They all have that - that's what FDDI means.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, but no-one else calls it that in their brochures. And you get a couple of bottles of 40-year old scotch with every one as a product endorsement.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Make it half a dozen with each one and I'll take 10.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Sharon looks a little concerned at this. 
<br />
<br />&quot;We'll never get away with it,&quot; she whispers. &quot;They'll cripple the net!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Sharon, Sharon, Sharon,&quot; I sigh. &quot;We're never going to use them, that's the key. We'll buy them and mention to the CEO that we'll be able to ensure that absolutely no-one can snoop our networks without being detected. He'll realise that the piece of software he uses to detect the schemers among his junior execs will be compromised, and late one night all the routers will disappear from the storage cupboard to reappear in a landfill somewhere in Bognor.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;You mean the CEO spies on the other execs to protect his job?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course! I'd be most put out if I'd written that software for nothing!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What if he's not snooping any more?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Please! Upper management has all the 'filial loyalty' of a piranha infested toilet bowl. And anyway, should that fail I will engage the old-favourite 100 per cent-foolproof kit-destruction ploy.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;What's that?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Switch the voltage to 115 and PLUG 'EM IN! Works every time.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;How much do they pay you to think up this stuff?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;NOT ENOUGH!&quot; 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The Bastard wreaks his terrible revenge ... 
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The problem with being away on a jolly, sorry fact-finding tour of the States, is that there's a hell of a lot of paperwork to catch up on. Normally, I shove this to one side and if any of the paper pushers upstairs complain they get shown the door swiftly when the CEO receives insulting e-mail from their PCs. It's amazing the rude words the chair warmers can come up with sometimes. 
<br />But this time it's different. It's yearly budget time again, which means once more it's time to print the 'Basic Computing' OHPs so I can explain to the technical management committee why we should look at upgrading our network. 
<br />
<br />I briefly consider not printing the 'This is a BIT, This is a BYTE' slides, but reconsider when I remember that one of the committee avoids lace-up shoes because it takes him an hour longer to get ready for work... 
<br />
<br />While I'm planning the phone rings. Caller-ID tells me that it's a nasty specimen from Public Relations who just yesterday, as chance would have it, was lucky enough to slip into a parking space that I myself was about to enter. 
<br />
<br />Lucky is, of course, a relative term, and subject to revision over time. The time is now. I press the 'record conversation' button. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Hi, network ops,&quot; I say. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I need a PCMCIA net card for my laptop. By Friday, 9am.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Of course it's Thursday afternoon, 3:45pm. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, equipment purchases must go through your department,&quot; I say. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Then you'll have to loan me one. The purchase order wouldn't go through in time. Besides, it's my personal machine, I've got a presentation to give to the CEO that I've been working on at home.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Wouldn't it be preferable to transfer all this via back-up floppies to your work machine?&quot; I ask, praying for the desired response. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't be stupid, it'd take me a year to back this lot up. Just get me a card and I'll do the presentation from my laptop tomorrow.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I've got a ... doctor's appointment right now so I won't have time to configure your machine for the card,&quot; I say, giving him the chance to dig a nice big hole. &quot;Also, I won't be in until about 9:30am tomorrow.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I'll do the bloody configuration!&quot; he growls. &quot;It's not rocket science, despite what you geeks attempt to imply!&quot; 
<br />
<br />Hole dug nice and deep. Now to work on the edging details... 
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know, if you get something wrong, or the card's incompatible..&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;IT'S A BLOODY PCMCIA CARD. HOW CAN IT BE INCOMPATIBLE!?!&quot; 
<br />
<br />The hole is perfection, in fact it looks almost grave-like. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, OK, I'll leave one in the equipment room. But take a network card and not a SECURE-network card. Do you know the difference?&quot; 
<br />
<br />He's in a lather now and there's no way he'd admit ignorance. 
<br />
<br />&quot;JUST LEAVE THE BLOODY CARD OUT AND I'LL PICK IT UP IN THE MORNING!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well OK..&quot; 
<br />
<br />He hangs up. 
<br />
<br />From the 'documentation' safe I pull out the 'special' PCMCIA card and pop it on the desk in the equipment room. 
<br />
<br />The next day I roll in at about 9:30 in time to be summoned to the CEO's office. 
<br />
<br />&quot;WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?&quot; he rants. 
<br />
<br />&quot;About what?&quot; I ask, innocence personified. 
<br />
<br />&quot;THAT BLOODY EXPLODING NETWORK CARD THAT CARSON IN PR GOT!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Exploding network card? What explo.. Oh dear. He didn't try to install a SECURE-network card in his machine did he? I told him yesterday to be careful about installing and configuring it. They're programmed to self-destruct if someone attempts to override their access parameters...&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;By self-destruct you mean..?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Well there's a tiny nitrate charge in them which burns out the circuitry..&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Or perhaps blows a hole the size of a saucer through the laptop in question?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;They DID have teething problems with the first batch, which is why I had them recalled to the equipment room in preparation to send them back to the manufacturer. But it shouldn't have been used in the first place. I warned Carson yesterday when he asked, it's all on the voice tapes...&quot; 
<br />
<br />Much later as I'm watching the name 'Carson, MJ' being removed from the floor directory and 'Carson, MJ' in person being removed from the premises, I can't help but wonder what makes people think they can beat the system. 
<br />
<br />It's a good system. It's MY system. 
<br />
<br />I like it. 
<br />
<br />Now, to complete plans for the budget meeting...</div>
