			<div class="content">Alright everyone, I am presenting my OWN Freelancer fanfiction, labeled &quot;Undertone&quot;. The beginning basically gives you background information of what happens in the first section. Ok, here it goes!
<br />
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />Undertone
<br />
<br />&#8220;They say curiosity brings new light to darker mysteries&#8230; I say it brings bull****.&#8221; Track threw his cigarette over the edge of the building as he scoffed and turned away.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What it doesn&#8217;t accomplish in science, it sure brings in the money.&#8221; Alice murmured. She was leaning against the side of the building, looking at the ground as she spent her last few minutes with her friend Track.
<br />
<br />Track and Alice were both members in the Rhineland military. They were around when Rhineland had invaded neighboring star systems. As a matter of fact, they were the front line soldiers who were thrown into a savage attack against Kusari. Their standing orders were to terminate any ship caught firing back. Generally speaking, they were forced to take out several ships.
<br />
<br />Their career as killers for an unknown cause ended when they abandoned their unit; left for one of the ice nebulas to avoid detection. Eventually the Blood Dragons found them, and after much negotiating, they managed to get their attention. The two pilots join their ranks to assist in any way for the greater good. Their missions were numerous, and both were only caught and identified on one occasion.
<br />
<br />After the war was ended quickly by the Freelancer who was rumored to have had something to do with the entire situation, both pilots returned home, only to find not handcuffs and court marshals ahead, but rather a hero&#8217;s welcome. It seemed Rhineland intelligence was better informed than the two knew.
<br />
<br />Track was not a very strong figure, 26 and built for speed. In fact he was very skinny, not sporting much muscle tone, but he had a reputation of getting into some nasty fights in some of the more ruthless areas of downtown New Berlin, and as a matter of fact there are many of those places. His record as a cargo escort pilot got him into the military. He hadn&#8217;t lived a grand life before he signed on, so he considered it his big break.
<br />
<br />His experience went further than just a cargo escort. His record featured many accounts of drug smuggling from entire sections of the system to the other undetected. Not many knew about this, but Rhineland Intelligence decided that it was best to have the criminals work to their advantage. Track probably wasn&#8217;t very tough looking on the outside, but inside he was a ruthless rouge. 
<br />
<br />However, while he did get in bed with the wrong crowd, some Outcasts, some of the Blood Dragons, even some of the Rhineland Military who decided to get rich quick, and found ways to avoid their own patrols due to their substantial knowledge of how their wings patrolled. Life was one adrenaline rush to the next. Getting caught wasn&#8217;t the hard part, it was getting out that was the hard part. Escaping a heavy Rhineland patrol, or an advanced Liberty Defender squadron was no picnic. This was when the criminals often fled into asteroid fields or nebula.
<br />
<br />While his career may seem like he was a bad person inside, he really didn&#8217;t have any intention or love for killing. He often spared civilian patrols whom stumbled across their smuggling convoy, and only disabled pursuing ships and left them behind for someone to find.  In his heart, Track wasn&#8217;t much in terms of a punk, criminal, degenerate or low-life. He was only looking for his cut, and now that he had signed up for the greater good, things may have just turned flip-side for him.
<br />
<br />His friend in all of this, Alice, seemed his exact opposite. She had lived fairly wealthy during her time in Rhineland, and previous time in Liberty. She often frowned upon visiting Bretonia due to what she called, &#8220;filthy living conditions and ghastly stench.&#8221; Her parents could only laugh at the thought.
<br />
<br />During her time growing up, her father had made several millions off trade exports. During the time new trade routes were being established, her father often took the opportunity to hit them first, and would make deliveries twice as fast as before. Most trading was dealt with between companies, such as AUG, Spa and Cruise, so on and so fourth. Her father owned his own private shipping business.
<br />
<br />He had gathered up a rather small group of employees, each one an experienced pilot. He gave each his own funded freighter, each one loaded down with the latest commodities and sent out to trade. Often, the usual convoy would head for Kusari space, where they would sell the newly discovered and very popular diamond imports for an enormous price. His cargo runs would estimate at least five million per run, and he often stimulated ten runs a day. This eventually lead to his success.
<br />
<br />However, through all the riches, Alice looked down on her family&#8217;s wealth as an embarrassment. She decided to take her chances amongst the stars, not as a freighter pilot, but instead a fighter. Her first idea was to enroll in the military and take up its courses. She managed to bump herself up the ladder of command, and found herself flying in the Rhineland patrols, and sometimes even in the Rhineland assault teams, poised to strike at hostile craft.
<br />
<br />In the same manor as Track, Alice is also a very slender figure without much build, and is 22 years of age. While she may not support a fighter pilots body, her look goes far by the stem of what Track calls, &quot;pilot sex appeal&#8221;. The thought makes her laugh every time she sees him bring the subject back up.
<br />
<br />While her stories of valiant Rhineland attacks and great slip-ups of hostile craft are numerous, she is still viewed as a rookie pilot in Track&#8217;s eyes, but instead of fighting him on the subject, she would rather contently agree on his comments. After all, he led the life of secrecy while she lead a life of fairly noisy expenditure.
<br />
<br />Getting back to the thought at hand, Track&#8217;s comment was referring to the new assignment given to him by Rhineland Command. His mission was to escort a supply of science vessels from nebula to nebula, located from various points in Rhineland space. Their purpose for doing this was unknown him to him, his partner Alice, or the rest of his squad.
<br />
<br />Rhineland Intelligence was also keeping its lips sealed. The nebula they were heading into had no significant features about them. Some had pirate activity, others radiation lurking in its gasses, and others just a large body of gas.
<br />
<br />Track sighed, and wished he hadn&#8217;t thrown his cigarette over the edge of the building. Alice walked towards him slowly and put a gentle hand on his shoulder. She looked back across the landscape and sighed as well. What a waste of their time, they both thought. It was going to be a long escort mission.
<br />

			<div class="content">Chapter 2: Walking the Walk...
<br />
<br />Track and Alice met up in the briefing room as planned, sat next to each other as always, discussed ideas, thoughts, and then waited patiently for the briefing. At first glance it would appear it wasn&#8217;t worth their wait.
<br />
<br />Commander Oldabeck appeared on station, neatly dressed in uniform with speedstick in hand. He promptly stood at his podium, the rest of the soldiers sitting up and paying attention. Track continued his slouching routine. Alice sat up, like the good girl she was intent on being.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alright, this is a simple mission, so I&#8217;ll be brief. A convoy of science vessels and other supply ships will be moving from eight different waypoints, until they reach their destination. At each waypoint, they will stop to take readings and intake, and then move on. Once they reach their final waypoint, they will dock with planet Stuttgart, and we will move from there. You aren&#8217;t to ask any question on where those transports are going. You will get there when you do. The only thing you should be required for is overseeing their mission. Chances of attacks are small. Report to the landing pad in thirty minutes. Dismissed.&#8221; The commander stepped back and then walked out of the room quietly. The pilots chattered amongst themselves.
<br />
<br />Track and Alice wasted no more time, and with a simple nod they bid each other farewell, and headed for the landing pad. Track lifted his wrist to his mouth and spoke into a small radio to the tech crews.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Track. Have my fighter on the pad and ready to go in a few minutes. Twenty tops.&#8221; He simply clicked it off after giving the order. He expected the crews to have his fighter on the pad with weapons equipped when he got outside. He always demanded a lot. His partner Alice was likely doing the same.
<br />
<br />Track stepped out of the building and into the sunlight, where his fighter began coming out of a port located next to the pad. The crews were running alongside the fighter and shouting orders at each other as they went. Track smiled at the timing, and effectiveness.
<br />
<br />Track made his presence known when he stamped his feet on the hard walkway. Some of the men looked back at him to check, and stood up when they caught sight. The others were too busy working to notice anything. Track stepped over to his fighter, a 90-ARKM-N9 &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, the perfect ship for him. After flying the common trade fighters he received when doing illegal business, he was thankful to have a fully operational military ship. While he had seen better, this ship was sturdy, able, and loaded with decent weapons. At least enough to scratch some Unioners.
<br />
<br />The flight deck was deemed clear, and Track was ready to launch into space. He quickly scrambled into his fighter, fumbled his headset on, and quietly lifted off the ground with a shudder, and then gently floated into space.
<br />
<br />Alice was waiting outside the docking ring, patiently tapping her foot on the floor of her fighter, the same as Track&#8217;s, and she came into formation as he exited the atmosphere. Track let his weapon systems come online, his engines reach top speed, and his sensors float out. No bandits in the areas, friendly vessels located only a few meters away. The science ships were waiting nearby.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I was wondering when you would get out here.&#8221; Alice said impatiently. Track only laughed slightly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Being late by a few seconds doesn&#8217;t mean you are any faster.&#8221; He replied. Alice smirked, and then exited formation and flew towards the rest of her team. She entered the frequency for the team, and then tapped in.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Might I ask which one of you gentlemen is in charge?&#8221; she politely inquired. Gamma 1 spoke up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am. I&#8217;ll be assigning you two teams, so, listen carefully.&#8221; Gamma 1 said quickly. Track pulled up and tapped in the frequency.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Track, you are to lead Alpha wing. You will fly right flank of the science ships. Alice, you have Beta wing, and you will fly left flank. My team, Gamma, will break in-between the top and bottom. We should have it covered. Alright, move out.&#8221; 
<br />Gamma 1 finished speaking and flew into formation with the science ships. Track nodded, and pulled over to the right with Alpha wing. Alice followed suit with Beta.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Track&#8230;&#8221; Alice spoke up over the comm channel. Track tapped in.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah?&#8221; he asked. Alice seemed to be fumbling around in her cockpit.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Remember a while back, when you said you would invite me over some time?&#8221; she asked. Track was puzzled by her inquiry, but responded.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah&#8230; what of it?&#8221; he asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Can we do that when we get back?&#8221; she asked. Track rolled his eyes.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Of course we can. What did you have in mind?&#8221; he asked. Alice giggled over the channel, and it seemed innocent at first, but Track found something behind her voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ve known each other for a while now&#8230; I thought we could try something new. You know&#8230;&#8221; Alice trailed off, and let Track fill in the blanks for himself. He then came to his senses after realizing what she was getting at.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That is absolutely fine with me. Just make sure it comes off easily, because I hate fumbling with tight clothes.&#8221; He advised. Alice laughed, and Track managed a smile. She narrowed her eyes and looked over.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sure to wear something&#8230; appealing&#8230;&#8221; she said in a low, sexy tone. Track felt like going nuts in his fighter, but decided to keep his heading.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alright. Don&#8217;t get me too excited before an escort mission. It will only take longer to get finished. Let&#8217;s stay focused.&#8221; He said. Alice agreed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;See you soon.&#8221; She whispered. Track switched to a public channel afterwards. Boy, this was going to take a while&#8230;
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">Chapter 3: &#8230;And Fighting the Fight
<br />
<br />The trip that the science ships had taken proved to be remarkably safe. Why Rheinland Command believed that they needed so many fighters seemed unheard of. They were flying twelve Valkyrie fighters alongside four science ships, heading for a nebula outside of New Berlin. The area was uncharted and the nebula was deemed for exploration later on. It seemed this was the opportunity to do some exploring.
<br />
<br />Track was nervously waiting for something exciting to happen. He had hopped someone would ambush the convoy and attack, that way he could get some action. At least to kind he was waiting for. They had been traveling on cruise speed for at least an hour now, and the planet New Berlin was barely visible.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Spot contacts on radar?&#8221; Track asked Alice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No contacts. Not even for fifty klicks. This seems stupid.&#8221; She sighed and leaned on her elbow. Track also felt tired and rather annoyed at the overuse of protection on this small and safe escort mission.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Sigma 3, we are heading into the gas nebula. All ships, keep a tight formation.&#8221; The science vessel gave orders quickly, and the ships soon were at the edge of the nebula. That&#8217;s when Track noticed something on his radar.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Gamma 1, I am reading fifteen contacts coming out of the nebula. Their configuration is unknown. The nebula is blocking too many readings.&#8221; Track signaled. Alice checked her own sensors, and sure enough, there were several contacts coming in quickly from the nebula.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alpha wing, you are to break off and move ahead to establish contact. Beta, move back and to the rear in case they try a flanking maneuver. The rest of you, stay on course.&#8221; Gamma 1 ordered. Track took his wing ahead and flew into the large yellow nebula. Alice took hers behind the convoy and they spread out into formation.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Unknown fighters, this is Alpha One of Rheinland Military, squad 21. You are ordered to identify yourself or break away. If you do not comply we will fire upon you.&#8221; Track made the order sound as formal as possible. The contacts continued to fly at them quickly. Track thought he might be able to get a decent reading if he flew just a bit closer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alpha wing, stay here. I&#8217;m going to go in for a closer look.&#8221; Track hit his thrusters and flew a few feet above the contact&#8217;s readings. He closed to at least three klicks out. He just needed to get only a little closer. Track flew higher, and faster as he went. When he was in range he did a quick scan. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is strange&#8230;&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Gamma 1, I&#8217;ve got a reading on the enemy fighters.&#8221; He reported.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What did you find?&#8221; Gamma 1 asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;They are&#8230; Stilettos, sir&#8230; Outcast Stiletto fighters.&#8221; He said softly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised.&#8221; The Gamma 1 commented.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What?&#8221; Track asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You will find out soon enough. Science ships, proceed into the nebula. Beta wing, move to the front and prepare to engage the enemy. The rest of you, fly around the transports. Alpha, you are to engage the enemy. Beta will assist you. I&#8217;m calling for some backup.&#8221; Gamma 1 finished speaking, and Track ordered his wing to follow him ahead. Alice came in from behind them, ready to assist.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alpha, I want two of you to break to the left. Alice, order two of your wingmen to break to the right. They will flank the enemy. We will hit them head on.&#8221; Track ordered. Alice called a few wingmen to move to the right, and the four remaining fighters took up flight alongside each other.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There they are&#8230; I see them.&#8221; Alice said. There was a clearing in the nebula that they could clearly see the fifteen engine signatures and Stiletto ships moving within range. Track flipped his weapons systems on, and the Stealthblade weapons under his wing became active.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Closing to fifteen hundred meters&#8230;&#8221; Alice reported. The enemy drew closer, however, they didn&#8217;t show signs of aggression.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Twelve hundred meters&#8230;&#8221; Alice reported again. Track let his fingers glide over the two weapon joysticks in his hands.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ten hundred meters&#8230;&#8221; Alice said. Track pulled out his comm and rang in to all wingmen flying with them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Break and engage. The fighters on the flanks, hit them from behind and from the sides. I&#8217;m going in.&#8221; Track put down his comm and hit afterburners. He hit weapons, and the Stealthblade&#8217;s flew from their cannons quickly with a green hue. Track nailed a fighter from the front, and it quickly spun out of formation and flew overhead. The enemy Stiletto&#8217;s broke off and began to fire back.
<br />
<br />Track and Alice tag teamed an enemy Stiletto, Track moving in behind it while Alice cornered it from the side. Track&#8217;s gunfire hit it from behind and its shields rippled. The fighter made a move to evade, but Alice shot off a salvo of Slingshot missiles. One of the missiles went after a dummy countermeasure launched by the Stiletto. The other hit him in the wing and blew it off. The Stiletto spun out of control, and Track hit a raw spot in his shielding. The Stiletto was destroyed, and its pieces scattered across space.
<br />
<br />Without congratulating each other, Track and Alice broke off to engage more hostiles. Alice saw one of her wingmen being chased by another Stiletto, the ship desperately trying to evade him. Alice flew intercept and came from its side. She fired off a pair of Slingshot missiles, and then let loose with the Stealthblade&#8217;s under her wing. The missiles caused the Stiletto to venture off, making the Stealthblade&#8217;s come on target and eat through his shielding and then pound his hull. Alice was sure he was finished, so she fired off one more Slingshot, and the missile impacted in the open spot in his shielding and hit him right under his wing. The ship went up in fire, and Alice broke off.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alpha wing, this is Gamma 1. Reinforcement are on the scope. You should be able to see them coming in from behind you.&#8221; Gamma 1 reported in. Track turned, and a large wing of Banshee&#8217;s swooped in from behind them and engaged the Stiletto fighters. Track saw the Banshee&#8217;s tear up at least three fighters on their approach to the battle, and the rest of Beta wing was chasing after another two. Alice however was coming under fire from a persistent Stiletto fighter.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Track, get this son of a ***** off my back!&#8221; she shouted. Track maneuvered his fighter in course with hers, and they moved on a collision course with one another.
<br />
<br />&#8220;When I say go, break upwards.&#8221; Track ordered. Alice kept on course with Track&#8217;s fighter, and they were moving towards one another very quickly. Distance was seven hundred meters. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Almost&#8230;&#8221; Track said to himself. The closing distance was getting uncomfortable. &#8220;Now! Go!&#8221; Track yelled over the comm. Alice&#8217;s fighter shot upwards, and Track nailed the Stiletto with a heavy stream of Stealthblade lasers. The enemy didn&#8217;t even have time to react. His fighter was blown to pieces, cockpit going up first and the rest exploding quickly thereafter.
<br />
<br />Track counted at least three Stiletto fighters left, and saw them retreating into the nebula. Gamma 1 rang in over the comm channel to inform him of their situation.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The enemy is retreating. Do not follow them. Zeta and Epsilon wing will remain behind with the transports. Beta 1 and Alpha 1, you are to come with me back to planet New Berlin. The rest of you, stay with the escorts. Gamma 2, you are in charge.&#8221; Gamma 1 ordered. Track flew next to his fighter, and Alice followed suit.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell is going on Gamma? Stiletto fighters? Outcasts? What was that convoy really for anyway?&#8221; Track asked. Gamma 1 sighed in his fighter.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you when we get back to New Berlin. In the meantime, consider what you saw out there classified.&#8221; Gamma 1 ordered. Track sighed, and leaned back in his seat. This really was bull****.</div>
