			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 2: A New Threat  </b> (apparently the prolog was chapter one<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />Trent loves his new cloaked ship. So he decided to go off to Omicron Gamma to chill with the Corsairs. Trent lands on Crete, sips on some Sidewinder Fang. He feels at home with his newfound friends. So he goes and starts talking to this Corsair chick.
<br />
<br />TRENT: Hi, my name is Trent.
<br />
<br />CHICK: Hi, my name is Gabriella.
<br />
<br />TRENT: Well, Gabriella, I have lost my number. Can I have yours?
<br />
<br />CHICK: OMFG, get away from me you Liberty Pansy.
<br />
<br />TRENT: WTF? Whats your problem?
<br />
<br />CHICK: Well, I just got back from a patrol. We were attacked over by a new jumphole we discovered.
<br />
<br />TRENT: Nomads?
<br />
<br />CHICK: No, but what I saw made my blood chill.
<br />
<br />TRENT: What?
<br />
<br />CHICK: While I was dogfighting, I saw letters on the side of the ship.
<br />
<br />TRENT: What did they say?
<br />
<br />CHICK: COALITION.....
<br />
<br />Trent thought to himself, Coalition? Was this some sort of prank? Some sick headed Outcast or something? He laughed to himself. Coalition forces, here in Sirius. Ha. They are all stuck on that rock, Earth. However, curiosity got the best of him. He payed the Corsair chick like 10.000 credits or something, and headed off to the coordinates she gave him.
<br />
<br />Trent flew for what seemed like hours. Then, he heard his Neural Net beep telling him he was getting close to the jumphole. Rubbing his tired eyes, he took the ship out of cruise. What he saw will remain burned in his mind forever.
<br />
<br />A large fleet of ships, complete with a couple battleships and the works, were all rallying together. Trent started to jump back into cruise, afraid of them seeing him, but remembered he had the cloak. So he slowly slid closer to the odd looking ships. His neural net showed them as UNKNOWN. The ships looked nothing like anything in Sirius. As he edged closer, he began to see markings on the side of the ships. Letters. Letters that spelled out a word he knew couldn't be true. COALITION.
<br />
<br />However, this was nothing compared to what he saw next. Behind the COALITION battleship,he thought he saw a few ships, bluish in color. Glass like. He gasped. NOMADS!
<br />
<br />In his panic, he accidentally pushes the UNCLOAK button on his console. His ship decloaks. Trent, just watches in awe as the ships begin to converge on his ship. Oh no! In a last second decision, he punches the thrusters. The Nomad and Coalition ships begin to fire upon Trents ship.
<br />
<br />TRENT: Faster, baby, faster!
<br />
<br />The ships shields were nearly down. So he heads to the unknown jumphole, and enters the unknown.

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 3: El Diablo  </b>
<br />
<br />Trent breathes a sigh of relief. He made it. He escaped through the jumphole. New question began to arise, as he wonders what will happen to him once he gets to the other side of the jumphole. More Coalition forces? Nomads? A new galaxy? Trent grows pale with fear as he approaches the end of the jumphole.
<br />
<br />WHOOSH. The familiar white and blue of hyperspace dissolves to the black and white of space.
<br />
<br />TRENT: Where am I?
<br />
<br />The space around him is tinted with green, much like the Omicron systems. His ship is illuminated by the twin suns, embraced in a cataclysmic struggle, throwing off yellow light everywhere. The nav computer struggles to identify the system, but only reads &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.
<br />
<br />All of a sudden, the tranquility of space was shattered by the sound of his computer...
<br />
<br />&quot;WARNING : INCOMING TORPEDO&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;WARNING : INCOMING TORPEDO&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent immediately snaps out of his trance. He hits the thrusters, and struggles to pull back the joystick. The force of his manuever has him planted in the back of his seat, sweat dripping off of his brow. Pulling over 9 G's, he watches as the torpedo sails past him, missing him by mere meters. He could feel the ambient heat from the torpedo as it sailed by, and he killed the engine leaving only his thrusters on for better manuevering.
<br />
<br />&quot;THAT WAS NO TORPEDO I'VE EVER SEEN!&quot;
<br />
<br />After he whispers this, he freezes as he notices the torpedo changing direction.
<br />
<br />TRENT : HOLY JEHOSAPHAT!
<br />
<br />The torpedo moved at speeds matching a missile. It streaked back towards his ship. As a reflex, he hits the thrusters, trying to outrun it. However, the torpedo quickly closed in on him. So Trent, out of ideas, drops his last countermeasure. The torpedo detonates mere meters away. His ship is shuddered as the torpedo ignites, knocking down his shields with the shrapnel, and then the shock wave hit his ship. Lights flickered on and off on his HUD, and he noticed he was loosing control of the ship. His once nimble fighter now handled like a Humpback freighter.
<br />
<br />Trent hits the cruise engines, and thats when he sees his attacker. A most unusual ship, much like the dagger, but bigger. And it was much faster than he was.
<br />
<br />The unknown ship fires what appears to be a cruise disruptor, and Trent his knocked violently forward as the ship dissengages cruise. This makes Trent very angry.
<br />
<br />TRENT : &quot;You wanna play it soft, I'll play it soft. You wanna play it hard, I'll play it hard&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent begins to use evasive manuevers, trying to fend off his attacker. The ship behind him isn't as agile as him, so Trent fakes left, then pulls hard right. The ship, thrown off, streaks past. Trent pulls a quick loop, and situates himself behind his attacker. He fires his captured Nomad Cannons at the ship, watching them bounce off the shields.
<br />
<br />Then the ship hits the brakes, and turns away. Trent, too late, streaks past him, and sees the letters &quot;COALITION&quot; printed on the side. Trent and the Coalition fighter then go head to head. They head towards each other in a life or death game of chicken.
<br />
<br />&quot;WARNING : INCOMING TORPEDO&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent quickly slides left at the last second, watching his attackers torpedo sail past, and Trent lets a Sunslayer do its business.
<br />
<br />WHOOOSH ---------------BOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Coalition ship is instantly nuked. However, the close proximity of the explosion blew his shields clean off, leaving him exposed. And then he remembered the torpedos have a very deadly homing mechanism. He punches the thrusters.......
<br />
<br />&quot;WARNING : INCOMING TORPEDO!&quot;
<br />
<br />Quickly, as his ship hurtles through space at nearly 200 kilometers a second, he spins to face backwards, and fires on the torpedo.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOM - His ship, unshielded, feels the effects of the torpedo's antimatter properties. His ship is shredded up, as pieces of hull fly off in all directions.
<br />
<br />He was defenseless. His cloak didnt work. His thrusters were gone. His cruise was disabled. He could only limp away at 80 k/s. His cloak was destroyed. Shields were damaged. Half his weapons rendered unoperational. He could only drift......
<br />
<br />&quot;WARNING : LIFE SUPPORT DAMAGED&quot;
<br />
<br />That was when he really began to realise, he'd experience asphixiation in less than five minutes. Already he could feel the cold of space trickling in, biting through his flight suit. He could only wait.
<br />
<br />Then, all of a sudden, he realised he wasnt alone.
<br />
<br />Trent's blood turns to ice, as the coalition fleet de-cloaks around him.
<br />
<br />One ship stood out in particular. The one that was many times the size of any battleship. The one that registered as a Juggernaut class ship, named the El Diablo.
<br />
<br />Trent can only watch in awe as the Coalition fleet closes in on him.
<br />
<br />TRENT : Oh no............

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 4: Escape </b>
<br />
<br />Trent is terrified as the Coalition fleet closes in. The El Diablo, a gigantic battleship, closes the distance slowly. He begins to feel the tractor beam pull him in gently, pulling his defenseless ship into one of El Diablo's bays. Trent trembles in fear as his ship is sucked in, and darkness floods the interior. The bay door closes behind him, and Trent begins to sweat.
<br />
<br />All of a sudden, the bay is flooded with light, as the overhead lights come on. A squad of troops come rushing in, bearing the eerily familiar star of the Coalition forces.
<br />
<br />TRENT : How can this be?
<br />
<br />Among these troops, walked a very strange being. A nomad. He spoke to the troops in his Nomad tongue, as the troops surrounded his ship.
<br />
<br />SOLDIER : We have you surrounded! Open the hatch or you will be fired upon!
<br />
<br />TRENT : Go to hell!
<br />
<br />SOLDIER : FIRE!!
<br />
<br />Lasers converge on his defenseless ship, ripping off panels of hull, and shattering the glass of the windshield. Trent jumps on the floor and grabs his pistol. As he begins to fire back, he powers up the ship with the last of the power, and flys into the midst of the troop formation.
<br />
<br />SOLDIER : Get down!
<br />
<br />The ship lands on the Nomad warlord, smearing his entrails as the ship careens around the bay.
<br />
<br />TRENT : DIIIIIIEEEEEEE!
<br />
<br />Trent is in a frenzy. The ship drops to the floor with a big clunk, and Trent whips out his pistol and dives through the window, taking down a few Coalition soldiers as he lands. Pulling out his machete, he desperately tries to take down as many troops as he can. However, a shot goes through his left leg, and he drops to the floor in pain. However, Trent isn't done. He slices the closest soldiers leg off.
<br />
<br />ZZZZZZZOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM
<br />
<br />Another shot goes through his shoulder, making him drop the machete. In a desperate effort, he drop kicks a soldier in the knee, watching as he falls to the floor in pain. Then he runs into the nearest hallway, firing as he went. All of a sudden.
<br />
<br />&quot;WARNING : INCOMING TORPEDO&quot;
<br />
<br />TRENT : What the hell?
<br />
<br />The ship shudders as a torpedo blasts a hole in the side of the El Diablo. All of a sudden, the bay door is blown away, sucking everyone out. Trent hangs on to a rail, as Coalition troops go flying out the window. A very familiar ship zooms in and stops in front of Trent. He gasps as he watches Orillion calling to him from the open hatch in the Order ship.
<br />
<br />ORILLION : Jump on you fool Lets get out of here!
<br />
<br />Trent leaps into the hatch, breathing a sigh of relief as the ship zips out of the bay. However, it seems he has just jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. As they make distance between them and the El Diablo, they realise that the Diablo isn't merely a battleship. It was a huge carrier.
<br />
<br />Thousands of Coalition ships came out of the El Diablo like hornets out of a nest. A Nomad battleship was parked not too far off, firing on the attacking Order ships. They couldn't last long.
<br />
<br />Then, they read familiar ships coming from the jumphole.
<br />
<br />TRENT : Oh my god! Were saved! Corsairs are coming to help us!
<br />
<br />A dozen wings of Corsairs came streaking into the fight. The Corsair pilots were heavely outnumbered, but they were much better pilots. Thats when they realised that there was a Corsair battleship behind them!
<br />
<br />ORILLION : Impossible!
<br />
<br />However, there wonder didn't last long.
<br />
<br />BOOM!
<br />
<br />ORILLION : We just lost our left wing! We have to land for repairs!
<br />
<br />Orillion, thinking quickly, guides the ship to the Corsair battleship. He notices that there are also Outcast Sabres, helping the Corsairs out. As they draw closer, they realise that what they saw is impossible. The ship was a sleeper class ship. And on the sides were written,
<br />
<br />&quot;HISPANIA&quot;.</div>

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 5: A New Beginning </b>
<br />
<br />Orillion guides the crippled Anubis into one of the many bays of the Hispania.
<br />
<br />TRENT : This is impossible! The Hispania was never found! HOw could this be?
<br />
<br />ORILLION : Well, maybe you should ask the captain. He will straighten things out.
<br />
<br />They both hop out after their Anubis lands. He notices that in the bay, there are fighters of all kinds. Order Anubis', Corsair Titans, and the newly engineered Outcast Sabre XT's. Then it dawns on Trent.
<br />
<br />TRENT : You guys are allied now!
<br />
<br />ORILLION : There is more. There's the captain. Ask him any questions you have. I have to get this wing repaired and go back to battle!
<br />
<br />Orillion runs back to his ship, as Trent approaches the captain.
<br />
<br />TRENT : Whats going on here?!
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Well, let me start from the beginning. For about a year or so, the Corsairs, the Outcasts, and the Order have put aside their differences and banded together to from the Hispanic Alliance, or just the Alliance.
<br />Anyways, we rebuilt and refitted the Hispania to be our flagship. Much more powerful then your typical battleship, it is nearly 3x the size as a Rheinland Battleship, and has about 6x the firepower. Most of the space is devoted to bays, so the Hispania also functions as a carrier to carry or fleet.
<br />However, about a month ago, we spotted this jumphole. We sent out some scouts, and discovered that the Coalition's evil can never be escaped. They are currently trying to cultivate a small moon on athe other side of those twin suns.
<br />So, our dear friend Orillion spotted you guys in trouble, and we immediately slipped throught the jumphole and saved you.
<br />
<br />TRENT : HOLY JEHOSAPHAT!
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : I must go to the bridge now. The battle continues.
<br />
<br />The Captain leaves down a corridor, and another man comes up.
<br />
<br />MAN : My name is Armando, and I will be your guide here on the ship. Any questions, just ask me.
<br />
<br />TRENT : Another ship?
<br />
<br />ARMANDO : Already taken care of. Follow me!
<br />
<br />They run across the bay to a shiny new Sabre XT.
<br />
<br />TRENT : Sweet!
<br />
<br />ARMANDO : Good luck sir!
<br />
<br />Trent makes the brand new Sabre XT roar to life. The bay door opens, and he zips out to fight in the fray.
<br />
<br />As Trent zooms out, he notices that the battlefield has become a huge space battle. The Nomad battleship was now parked by the Hispania, trying desperately to destroy her. However, the Hispania dwarfed the Nomad battleship, and the Nomads were now trying to limp away.
<br />
<br />The Coalition juggernaut, El Diablo however, was another story. It was the same size as the Hispania, and was coming for her. The El Diablo sat on the other side of the Hispania, blowing holes through the Hispania while the Nomad Battleship fired on the other side. The Hispania began to take on heavy fire.
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : DAMN! GET RID OF THAT DAMN NOMAD BATTLESHIP! ALL AVAILABLE FIGHTERS ARE TO FIRE ON THE NOMAD BATTLESHIP!
<br />
<br />Trent was already firing on it. The Sabre XT came with two Sunslayer torpedo tubes, and Trent was already searching for the weak spot. The bridge of the battleship. He knew that the Nomad ships weren't mechanical, they acted more like they were alive. The bridge was the battleships heart, so he let off 2 sunslayers at the bridge.
<br />
<br />BOOM! BOOM! CRAAAAASSSSSSSSHHHHHH!
<br />
<br />The torpedos impacted with tremendous force, causing secondary explosions to rock the Nomad battleship. The battleship couldnt take much more.
<br />
<br />Trent comes in for the second pass, and this time, lets off six Sunslayers before swerving left.
<br />
<br />TRENT : EAT THIS YOU BASTARDS!
<br />
<br />BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Nomad battleship disintegrates with a brilliant flash. The shockwave rocks Trents Sabre as he yells out &quot;YEAH!&quot;
<br />
<br />With only the El Diablo left, the heavily armed Hispania concentrates all its firepower on the El Diablo. Explosions went off all over the Diablo. Then, sensing it had enough, it coasted away towards the twin suns, slowly changing to a black color as the ships cloak was turned on.
<br />
<br />A great cheer went off throughout everyones radios, as they realised that the Coalition forces could be beat.
<br />
<br />A giant party was thrown on the Hispania, as everyone celebrated their victory over their ancient foes.
<br />
<br />Only one thing troubled Trent.
<br />
<br />Orillion had a very grim look on his face.
<br />
<br />ORILLION : They'll be back.....</div>

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 6: Fear </b>
<br />
<br />Trent made friends easy on the Hispania. Many he knew from his frequent missions at Crete and Tripoli Shipyard. The ship was very large, and Trent was almost lost in the vast size of the Hispania. She was also relatively agile for her size, at nearly 3 times the size of a Rheinland battleship. Ships this size fell into the Juggernaut class. Every House was now constructing their own Juggernaut class ship. However, this was done in secret, to prevent attacks from pirates and other terrorists.
<br />
<br />These Juggernaut ships held vast amounts of ships, serving as both a carrier, and a huge platform for offensive weaponry. The vast bays of the Juggernaut class ships could hold ships as big as Cruiser class ships. It just seems that everything was getting bigger.
<br />
<br />Everyone knows that the Nomad battleships can pack a much bigger punch than any of the House ships. If this was so, what if the Nomad battleships are just a small taste of some of the deadlier ships they have? A Nomad Juggernaut? Or maybe something even larger? These questions worry Trent, like a splinter in his mind.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile......in the New York system........a Liberty patrol guards the Zone 21 area.
<br />
<br />ALPHA ONE : Two more hours guys, then we can head back to Newark.
<br />
<br />ALPHA TWO: There is nothing out here sir. I dont get it.
<br />
<br />ALPHA ONE : Get what Alpha Two?
<br />
<br />ALPHA TWO: Why are we patrolling this area? This is Zone 21! Why are we guarding a damn mine field?
<br />
<br />ALPHA ONE : It was a special assignment given to us by Officer Jun'ko Zane herself.
<br />
<br />ALPHA TWO : And why do we have to cooperate with those Order pilots? Weren't we against them not too long ago?
<br />
<br />ALPHA ONE : They helped save the universe, you moron.
<br />
<br />ORDER SHIP : Thats right. You see, there is a jumphole to Alaska in the midst of this minefield. And guess whats in the Alaska system?
<br />
<br />ALPHA TWO : Who?
<br />
<br />ORDER SHIP: Nomads, Alpha Two, very bad Nomads...
<br />
<br />All of a sudden two wings of Nomad fighters materialize out of the jumphole.
<br />
<br />ORDER SHIP : Nomads! Holy Jehosophat!
<br />
<br />The Nomad fighters didn't sit still for long. They made for the patrol, firing bolts of purple destruction.
<br />
<br />ORDER SHIP : Watch out! Their weapons are extremely powerful!
<br />
<br />The Nomad ships stayed in formation, firing on the weak Liberty Patriots.
<br />
<br />ALPHA TWO : ARGGGGGGGHHHHHHH..........
<br />
<br />BOOOOOM! Alpha Two vaporizes in a incinerating ball of fire and Nomad laser fire.
<br />
<br />ALPHA ONE : Does anybody read me? This is Alpha One. We are under attack by Nomad forces. Request backu..........
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOM! Alpha One is no more, as the other Nomad wing closes in on him and fires all at once.
<br />
<br />ORDER SHIP : NOOOOOO!
<br />
<br />The Order ship fights valiantly. The Anubis fires its deadly Death's Hand cannons at the nearest wing of Nomads. As he fires on them, the second wing pulls in behind him, spraying him with deadly Nomad cannon fire. He wouldnt last long. Then he saw something worse.....
<br />
<br />Coming out of the jumphole. More Nomads. What appeared to be eight battlships, a sea of Nomad fighters, and a very very large Nomad ship, dwarfing the other battleships. It read as Juggernaut : Unknown on his sensors. It was at that moment that the Order Pilot knew that all hope was lost. A Nomad Torpedo closes in behind him, and vaporizes him instantly....
<br />
<br />The Nomad fleet doesn't waver long. Once formed up, they head for the nearest planet.
<br />
<br />Manhattan...........
<br />
<br />Meanwhile in Manhattan's orbit.......the battleship Chicago begins its checklist for its cruise to West Point. Recent reports of Nomad activity have the Liberty Navy on guard. Most of the entire fleet is based over at West Point, ready to deploy. The Chicago is the last battleship to report there.
<br />
<br />CHICAGO PILOT : This is the Liberty Navy Battleship Chicago, asking for all clear on the checklist.
<br />
<br />CONTROLLER 1: ALL GREEN!
<br />
<br />CONTROLLER 2 : ALL GREEN!
<br />
<br />CONTROLLER 3 : ALL GREEN!
<br />
<br />CONTROLLER 4 : SIR! I have a incoming radio transmission.
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Whats goin on? Put it on speaker.....
<br />
<br />TRANSMISSION : *****Does anybod*****her**me****
<br />This is ****lpha One*****we are u**** attack b*** Nomad *****orces. Request backu***********************************************
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Set the waypoint to those coordinates! Full power!
<br />
<br />PILOT ONE : Aye aye sir..
<br />
<br />The Captain looks concerned. Nomads? In Liberty? How? He tries to remember his briefing. There have been reports of Nomad activity out in the Omicrons. But thats light years away! How could they be here in Liberty? The worst thing they have here are Rogues......
<br />
<br />Then he remembers. He was in a top secret meeting with all the other captains. Jun'ko Zane was speaking......saying something about the Zone 21 minefield. And a jumphole inside, that may be dangerous.
<br />
<br />The Chicago was still within sight of Manhattan when things went from bad to worse. Much worse.
<br />
<br />RADAR CONTROLLER : Sir! I have multiple bogies incoming on Radar!
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Faction? Type?
<br />
<br />RADAR CONTROLLER : Unknown. If my scans are correct, there are eight battlship class ships and one......um.....your not going to believe this......
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : What? WHAT?!
<br />
<br />RADAR CONTROLLER : The scanner turns up eight battleships and one........Juggernaut class ship........you heard me right.....a Juggernaut.....escorted by over a hundred small fighter crafts.
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Very well..... get on the radio and report back to Newark. Tell them they are going to have company in a few hours. It appears a very large unknown fleet of ships has came throught the Zone 21 jumphole and are heading straight for Manhattan! Be advised, scans report 8 battleships, a hundred plus fighters, and a Juggernaut!
<br />
<br />RADIO : Yes sir......
<br />
<br />The Captain knew very well that his battleship was no match for the incoming fleet. He hoped for a peaceful contact.
<br />
<br />If not, he knew that the Chicago and her crew of 2000 were gone.....
<br />
<br />The Captain, looking out into space, spots the incoming fleet. He could easily make out a very large ship, eight smaller ones, and a swarm of tiny ones.
<br />
<br />It was then that he knew that he would never see his children again. The ships were bluish purple in color. They could be only one thing....
<br />
<br />The Nomad Fleet.......</div>

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 7: The Gamble </b>
<br />
<br />A cloud of Nomad ships blots out the hot Liberty sun. Thousands of transmissions are heard, all in a strange foreign tongue. The mass of ships began to form up into an organized formation, spanning miles and miles.
<br />
<br />The fleet was visible from Manhattan. A great bluish cloud, making the sun dark, casting blue shadows over nearby Newark Station.
<br />
<br />The Chicago was going on an impossible mission. One that it would never return from...
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : I want you to get me close to that Nomad battleship on the end.
<br />
<br />PILOT : Close? Sir.....
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Just do it. It is the only thing saving Liberty...
<br />
<br />RADIO : I just got word that some guy in a stolen ship has killed LSF Officer Jun'ko Zane......
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Good. I always thought she caused more trouble than she did good.....
<br />
<br />PILOT : We are nearing the Nomad fleet
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : My god......
<br />
<br />The Nomad fleet stretched for miles, clouds of Nomad fighters surrounding enormous battleships, and the Nomad Juggernaut could be seen from miles and miles away.
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Gun control, on my mark, fire all torpedo tubes at that battleship. Give it all she gots. Aim for the bridge!
<br />
<br />GUNNER : Aye aye, sir.
<br />
<br />RADAR : Sir, multiple bogeys inbound!
<br />
<br />The nearest battleship began to move forward, and the swarm of Nomad escorts moved in on the Chicago with impressive speed....
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Fire!
<br />
<br />Eight torpedo's streamed out towards the Nomad battleship. The battleship, while enormous and packing a heavy punch, was very slow at manuevering. The torpedos impacted right on target.....
<br />
<br />BOOOM! BOOM! BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!
<br />
<br />The Nomad battleship was racked with explosions, Nomad debris flying everywhere. However, it too had launched its torpedo silo....
<br />
<br />CHICAGO COMPUTER : WARNING! INCOMING TORPEDOS!
<br />
<br />Thats when the Nomad fighters converged on the CHicago. The Chicago's powerful flak guns tore apart the unshielded Nomad fighters. However, there were simply too many of them. They began to blow off the turrets, one by one. Defeat seemed imminent......when all of a sudden....
<br />
<br />RADIO : Incoming transmission!
<br />
<br />&quot;Chicago, this is the LN Seattle and the LN Sacremento. Thought you could use some help...&quot;
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Thank you Seattle and Sacremento. Target the......
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOM! A Nomad torpedo struck the Chicago, spilling debris from a gaping hole in the side.
<br />
<br />ENGINEERING : Sir, the torp has taken out our torpedo tubes!
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Damn. Radio, tell the Seattle and Sacremento to turn tail. We must draw them to our fleet somehow.
<br />
<br />RADIO : Aye aye sir.
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Where is the fleet?
<br />
<br />RADIO : Incoming transmission!
<br />
<br />&quot;Chicago, Seattle, Sacremento, you are to disengage and head to the Pittsburgh debris field.... this is the LN Mississippi.....we are currently in position in the field. We think that we may be able to draw them into the field, and get them stuck. Our ships are much smaller, and can better navigate the field. Exercise caution. Many a Liberty battleship has arrogantly entered the field, and had to be towed because it became trapped. Good luck!&quot;
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : Set a course for Pittsburgh!
<br />
<br />PILOT : Aye aye sir!
<br />
<br />The Seattle, Sacremento, and Chicago lept forward towards Pittsburgh. To their joy, they saw the enormous Nomad fleet begin to break formation, and follow them. Hopefully, they would get them stuck in the debris field and be able to destroy them.
<br />
<br />WARNING : INCOMING TORPEDO!
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Chicago became crippled, its engines destroyed. Its momentum kept it moving at the same speed. However, the captain knew the obvious. Once the ship reached the field, it wouldnt be able to slow down.
<br />
<br />It would plunge into it at nearly 300 kilometers a second, the debris would disentegrate the ship......and all those aboard her.........</div>

<br />The captain raises his eyes up, &#8216;Merry, please, don&#8217;t be angry at me&#8217;. The captain wasn&#8217;t a religious man, maybe something changed in him but he couldn&#8217;t remove her image in his eyes. &#8216;Merry, I tried&#8217; he almost whisper. Merry was the only woman in his life. They married young. But that look of her when she caught in air lock never fades away. &#8220;Come`on people, row! We&#8217;ll show them how hard our steel is.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Sounds fills Toms dashboard, &#8220;Captain we have incoming torpedo&#8230;&#8221;. Captain turns to the screen &#8220;Speed?&#8221;. Radar man seems like trying push to many button at once, &#8220;255 and accelerating 10 clicks per second, estimated hit 47 seconds&#8221;.
<br />&#8220;45&#8221;
<br />&#8220;40&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Alright, Kris, release flares on my command and every second afterwards&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Aye Aye&#8230; Sir we have turrets, should I try to intercept?&#8221; Kris was the gun man, pretty deadly when it comes to point and click.
<br />&#8220;No, its too fast, we&#8217;ll give it a carpet, red carpet&#8221;
<br />&#8220;20&#8221;
<br />&#8220;15&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Kris fire first flare&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Yes sir&#8230; first flare away&#8230;second&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;10 seconds&#8221;

<br />&#8220;What the faa&#8221;
<br />&#8220;2&#8221;

<br />&#8230;
<br />&#8220;Ok, its clear. Kris did she hit one of your flares?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;No&#8230;Captain its moving straight ahead.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Alright, Jenny update our coordinates to&#8230;.&#8221; Toms interrupts captains almost with panic in his voice. &#8220;Sirrr, she coming back&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Oh my god, reverse engine, turn left 40 and fire the flare. Kris, fire &#8216;em like hell&#8221;. That was &#8220;penetrator&#8221; or what ever the name was, we had briefing about possible vulnerability. Imagine what single bullet can do with combined speed us and its own.
<br />
<br />Red lights everywhere. &#8220;Captain we lost the engines, we losing speed fast&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Dammit!!! Where are LMs? Call them and say where going to evacuate, and declare Argaman stage&#8221; I have one more surprise

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 9: The Battle of Pittsburgh </b>
<br />
<br />The Liberty and Nomad fighters clashed. Patriots and Nomads were
<br />getting incinerated, flak fire exploding all over the place, taking out both
<br />fighters alike. Then, the gunboats came. The Nomad gunboats fired their
<br />missiles into the mess, trying desperately to hit the nimble Patriot
<br />fighters. The Oklahoma was getting heavy damage from the Nomad
<br />fighters torpedos. However, it continued to fight valiantly, firing its
<br />massive forward turrets and flak guns, taking in damaged Patriots, giving
<br />them a quick fix, and putting them out to fight once more.
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : Fire wave two! FIRE FIRE!
<br />
<br />A wave of torpedos flew from the battleships and sailed to the nearest
<br />Nomad battleship, and rendered it to a bluish mist.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />Three of the trapped Nomad battleships were lost, while the other two
<br />continued to slowly move forward through the debris, its guns clearing a
<br />path to the Oklahoma.
<br />
<br />All of a sudden, the two Nomad battleships fired their wave of torpedos.
<br />Purple lances of light shot forth, as the torpedos locked on to the
<br />Oklahoma, and closed in with fast speed. The Oklahoma saw the
<br />incoming torpedos, and tried to evade.
<br />
<br />
<br />OKLAHOMA CAPTAIN : EVASIVE MANUEVERS!
<br />
<br />The Oklahoma desperately lunged to the left, and the torpedos impacted
<br />on the back section.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The ass end section of the Oklahoma was blown clean off. It was now a
<br />dead stick. The engines were taken out cleanly. And already the second
<br />wave of nomad battleships were coming in the distance.
<br />
<br />The Oklahoma still had its torpedo tubes and guns however. It fired its
<br />flak guns with deadly accuracy, taking out the Nomad fighters and
<br />gunships. However, a wing of Nomad fighters broke through the Patriot
<br />swarm and fired its torpedos on the Oklahoma. Six torpedos sailed
<br />towards the Oklahoma, and there was nothing the Oklahoma could do
<br />about it.
<br />
<br />CAPTAIN : FIRE TORPEDO TUBES! ALL OF THEM!
<br />
<br />The Oklahomas torpedos sailed towards the nearest incoming Nomad
<br />battleship. However, the Oklahoma would never see the explosion.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! The Nomad torpedos impacted all over the
<br />Oklahoma, blowing it to pieces. Nobody survived.
<br />
<br />However, the Oklahoma had discharged its torpedos. The Nomad
<br />battleship had no way of evading it, so it tried to desperately shoot them
<br />out before they came close. They failed.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />Only one more battleship! However, they could see clearly the second
<br />wave of Nomad battleships approaching.
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : FIRE WAVE THREE!
<br />
<br />The third wave of torpedos sailed to their target with deadly accuracy. In
<br />desperation, the Nomad battleship fired a broad side of torpedos into the
<br />cloud of Patriot and Nomad fighters. The torpedos blew the last Nomad
<br />battleship into a cloud of blue mist. However, its dirty work had been
<br />done. Explosions could be seen impacting on ships in the big dogfight,
<br />taking out a hundred or so fighters, Nomad and Patriot alike. You could
<br />hear the screams of surprise as torpedos nuked 10 or 20 fighters at a
<br />time.
<br />
<br />The first wave had been defeated! However, the second group of Nomad
<br />battleships were closing in. Ten battleships. And almost two thousand
<br />fighters. This time, the Nomads didn't fall for the trick. They all of a
<br />sudden stopped just outside the debris field. Then, before the captains
<br />could know what they were doing, the Nomad battleships began to fire
<br />their torpedos from far off. The torpedos were hitting chunks of debris,
<br />but some made it through.
<br />
<br />BOOOOM! One hit the Sacremento right on, blowing a gaping hole in the
<br />side. The Nomad torpedos had a longer range! The Nomad battleships
<br />kept firing torpedos into the area. Most missing, blowing a path in the
<br />debris field. Others however did hit their targets with devastating results.
<br />
<br />BOOOOM! Another torpedo hit the battleship Sacremento.
<br />
<br />SACREMENTO CAPTAIN : Mississippi, this is the Sacremento. We are
<br />taking heavy fire! The Nomads are not going into the trap!
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : Pull back to Pittsburgh! Pull back!
<br />
<br />The battlships turned tail and fleed into the debris field, torpedos
<br />impacting all over the place. Some hitting the engines of the fleeing
<br />battleships.
<br />
<br />BOOOOM! A torpedo blew a hole in the Miami, knocking out its engines.
<br />It continued to sail forward however, because the planet Pittsburgh could
<br />be seen in the distance. And circling the planet was the entire Liberty
<br />Navy, ringing the planet. Swarms and swarms of Liberty spacecraft flew
<br />everywhere, everything from Patriots and Defenders to modified Rhinos.
<br />This was Liberty's last stand.
<br />
<br />The Nomad fleet was blowing a hole through the debris field to
<br />Pittsburgh. It would be a matter of hours before they reached the Liberty
<br />Navy, and the Battle of Pittsburgh would begin.
<br />
<br />Everybody was impatient. Sweat beaded down everyones face. They
<br />could the torpedos detonating in the distance, blowing a path to the
<br />Liberty fleet. All of a sudden, one torpedo made it through.
<br />
<br />It zipped through the field and caught one of the thousands of weapons
<br />platforms orbiting the planet. BOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Nomad fleet now had a clear path! One Nomad battleship charged
<br />through the field, clearing if further, and tried to kamikaze the fleet!
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : FIRE WAVE ONE!
<br />
<br />There were so many torpedos, it was crazy. It was literally a wave of
<br />torpedos, stretching at least a mile long. The battle had begun.
<br />
<br />The Nomads saw the torpedos, and fired their own wave. The two waves,
<br />one white, the other purple, stretched at least a mile long. The waves
<br />past each other, and impacted on each others battleships.
<br />
<br />Shockwaves eminated from everywhere. Fighters were disintegrating
<br />everywhere from the shockwaves. Battleships were being blown to
<br />pieces left and right. Nomad and Liberty. Then the fighters clashed in the
<br />biggest dogfight ever seen in Sirius.
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : FIRE AT WILL! FIRE AT WILL!
<br />
<br />Thousands died in the first minute of the engagement. Nomad and
<br />Liberty alike. The whole Liberty and Nomad fleet clashed. Thats when
<br />things turned from bad to worse.
<br />
<br />An extremely large Nomad ship came up last, dwarfing the smaller
<br />Nomad battleships.
<br />
<br />THE NOMAD JUGGERNAUT!
<br />
<br />It was just massive. It pushed its way through the field, and then it let
<br />out its fury.
<br />
<br />It launched a hundred torpedo wave!
<br />
<br />The wave approached the Sacremento.
<br />
<br />SACREMENTO : May god help us al..........
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />It just blew the Sacremento to pieces. Then it launched a second wave of
<br />torpedos!
<br />
<br />MIAMI : We have 100 torpedos incoming!
<br />
<br />ZOOOOOOM.....ZOOOOOOM........BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Miami was obliterated. The explosion even took out two Liberty
<br />cruisers nearby. The shockwave disintegrated anything in its path.
<br />
<br />
<br />It launched yet another wave. This time at the famous MISSISSIPPI.
<br />
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI CAPTAIN : Evasive manuevers!
<br />
<br />The Mississippi lunged left. The hundred or so torpedos sailed past and
<br />impacted on the nearest battelship.
<br />
<br />YUKON : ARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : We cant take this much longer!
<br />
<br />Then all of a sudden, the Nomad battlships tried deperately to turn
<br />around. The juggernaut tried desperately to turn around.
<br />
<br />A ship approximately the same size as the Nomad Juggernaut was
<br />approaching. And if fired its own wave of torpedos at the Nomad
<br />Juggernaut.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! Flames engulfed the
<br />ass end of the Nomad giant, but didn't destroy it. Another wave came
<br />forth from the other ship
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Juggernaut began to shudder as secondary explosions racked the
<br />ship.
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : FIRE ON THAT BIG NOMAD SHIP! CONCENTRATE ALL
<br />FIRE!
<br />
<br />A wave of torpedos came forth from the Liberty battleships, blowing
<br />holes in the front of the Juggernaut. Then, the other ship fired another
<br />torpedo silo.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Juggernaut was starting to fall apart. However, a swarm of Nomad
<br />fighters erupted from its bays like an angry swarm of bees. They
<br />swarmed around the ship firing on the Nomad Juggernaut.
<br />
<br />
<br />MISSISSIPPI : Its the Jacobi!
<br />
<br />The Jacobi fired the last torpedo silo and blew the Nomad juggernaut into
<br />four pieces. They eventually exploded in a huge inferno.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<br />OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<br />OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<br />OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<br />!
<br />
<br />The shockwave took out a Nomad battleship, engulfed in the flames.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<br />!
<br />
<br />Then the Jacobi worked on the other battleships. It fired a torpedo silo,
<br />and a missile silo. The missiles went to the Nomad fighters, blowing them
<br />up by the hundreds. The torpedos took out another Nomad battleship.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />There were now only about 5 Nomad battleships left. They wouldnt last
<br />long with the Jacobi and the entire Liberty Navy firing at them. They tried
<br />desperately to concentrate their fire on the Jacobi. They fired torpedos at
<br />her, but they did nothing to a ship of her size. The Jacobi fired torpedos
<br />at another one.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The battleships fired on the other.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Jacobi's missiles rendered the Nomad fighters to dust with its infinite
<br />missiles. The Jacobi fired another silo at another battleship.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The other two however were getting pissed. They blew past the Jacobi
<br />and fired torpedos at the Alabama.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! It blew a huge
<br />hole in the side of the Alabama. It was crippled. Then the battleships
<br />kamikazed her.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! The
<br />bigger Nomad ships cut the Alabama in two, and destroyed three cruisers
<br />as well as the Alaska. Then the other two battleships self destructed and
<br />blew apart a couple of other battleships.
<br />
<br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
<br />
<br />The Nomad fleet was defeated.
<br />
<br />A great cry came up over the radio.
<br />
<br />YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
<br />
<br />The Liberty fleet however was in bad shape. Most of the battleships were
<br />crippled, all of them impacted with at least two or three torpedos. They
<br />lost 27 battleships that day.
<br />
<br />And the Coalition fleet still drew closer.......................</div>

			<div class="content"><b>Chapter 10: Problems </b> (i don't really like this chapter...no offense to &quot;Ice&quot; but this wasn't written very good)
<br />
<br />Meanwhile in the docking bays of the modified Hispania...
<br />Trent:I kick your ass!
<br />Orillion:Come and get me tough boy!
<br />Trent punched into orillions face but orillion retaliated by a fast kick into trent's stomach. When trent became a bit stunned by the assault on his stomach he started to cough. Orillion didn't attacked. He waited and started to talk.
<br />-Why you can't understand it? I wanted to pay you but i had to leave because we had to investigate the nomad's fleet! Is that really hard to understand?
<br />-Y... Yeah right... And what about juni? She didnt said a word about you. That you gonna leave... And not gonna pay me...
<br />-Sheesh. Trent you are out of your mind. Some pills can help you with this.
<br />-I think you are the one in need of pills... Some cyanide pills!
<br />And trent weins became filled with adrenaline and tried to puch orillion but he just simply dodged the magnificent attempt. But it wasnt that easy to get rid from trent. He used the momentum to kick the legs of orillion. Orillion wasnt very happy with this and he let this know by loudly says an OW!
<br />-OW!
<br />-So now you are on the ground you can start to talk.
<br />And all of a sudden trent realised that he kicked a dangerous material called orillion. But he wasnt afraid. He had 3 reasons to be not afraid.
<br />1,He has a strong leg and he was the first in the space academy running championship. So orillion needs some strength to stand up.
<br />2,Orillion is not angry... He gets angry by a lot of enemy.
<br />3,Orillion was on the ground and any attempt to stand up should fail in another painful incident.
<br />-And what the hell you want to talk about? I think we already discussed this...
<br />-WRONG! I still have some questions. First of all why juni betrayed me?
<br />-What do you mean she betrayed you? She liked you!
<br />-Yeah? And what was that white on her mouth when i met with her? Hmm?
<br />-Well she likes cahoona milk.
<br />-Milk?
<br />-Milk.
<br />Trent started to sweat. His heart started to qnock out his lungs and he felt like the world is spinning.
<br />-You cant be serious... This isnt true... This cant be true!
<br />-Whats wrong trent?
<br />-I killed juni.
<br />-NOOO!!!!!!!!
<br />Orillion's hands became hard as a rock and he stood up quickly like the lightning. He forgot the pain in his leg and now he was angry and now he wasnt on the ground.
<br />-I KILL YOU!
<br />And before orillion could slash trent into pieces the speakers turned on.
<br />-This is the captain! Radar picked up a large unknown fleet. All crew get to the turrets! Pilots get into your ships and prepare for take off. The torpedo crew get the tubes filled with juice. This is gonna be rough!
<br />And the calm hispania became angry. The crew ran to their position and the turrets turned to the designated coordinates. The tubes became filled with torpedoes and the fighters was ready for take off. Trent didnt found a ship to get in. The sabre XT wasnt there where he left it, he only found a titan. The titan looked just the same as the normal titans but with closer examination it was really different. The armor of the ship was robust. It had 6 torpedo launcher but those doesnt looked like regular torpedo launchers. They were painted to red and they had signs that said they contain VERY dangerous material. Trent didnt wanted to get into the robust ship but he didnt had any other choices. It was hard even to open the cockpit. When trent finally opened the cockpit he noticed that the cockpit glass was 15 CM thick.
<br />-OH MY GOD! What is this? A flying tank?
<br />And he heard that they launching the torpedoes from the hispania. The red lights in the fighter bay started to flash up and the loud ear killing sound of bay gates started to be heareable. Every personnel left the bays and the fighters gravitanional holders turned off. The big gates of the bays opened.
<br />-I hope it is.
<br />And he turned on the engines.</div>

<br />&quot;What action will you take?&quot;
<br />&quot;Time is running out sir&quot;.
<br />&quot;Chancellor?&quot;
<br />&quot;Block all exits in Rhienland. I want every navy officer, police officer, privateer, and freelancer out there!&quot;
<br />&quot;But si&quot;...
<br />&quot;I don't care! We'll need all the help we can get! Rhienland is too big to defend, we can only hope to protect New Berlin&quot;.
<br />&quot;I'll contact the admiral&quot;.
<br />&quot;Not yet! I have a plan. We will seperate all the ships into four squadrons. Each will be given coordinates to lay mines&quot;.
<br />&quot;But that will deplete our recources!&quot;
<br />&quot;What other choices do we have!?&quot;
<br />&quot;Very well, I shall contact the Admiral and tell him your orders&quot;.
<br />
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Squadron Alpha, we are in position and ready to go&quot;.
<br />&quot;Beta in position&quot;.
<br />&quot;Gamma ready&quot;.
<br />&quot;Delta Squadron here, all systems are check&quot;
<br />&quot;This is central control, the mission is a go. Now lay the mines at those coordinates and get the hell out of there&quot;.
<br />&quot;Roger that&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alpha here, we are done and ready for the assault&quot;.
<br />&quot;Gamma Squadron is finishing up&quot;.
<br />&quot;Nothing's getting through here, Delta out&quot;.
<br />&quot;Beta, hurry up and mine those coordinates&quot;
<br />&quot;Our ships are malfunctioning!&quot;
<br />&quot;Get the hell out of there! Now!&quot;
<br />&quot;Damn! my engines are out!&quot;
<br />&quot;All ships go to Beta's coordinates, we are detecting multiple fighter wings inbound! I repeat, all fighters to Beta's coordinates!&quot;
<br />&quot;Our ships are failing!&quot;
<br />&quot;Damnit! they must have gotten advanced machinery jammers! Fire the long range Ion cannon!&quot;
<br />&quot;But it's only a prototype!&quot;
<br />&quot;All of our ships will get destroyed if we don't!&quot;
<br />&quot;It's still in testing!&quot;
<br />&quot;Fire it!&quot;
<br />&quot;Right away sir&quot;.
<br />&quot;Ion cannon charging up. thirty percent&quot;
<br />&quot;Damn! More are jumping in!&quot;
<br />&quot;Fifty percent. Sixty percent. Seventy percent.&quot;
<br />&quot;Come on come on!!&quot;
<br />&quot;Eighty percent. ninety percent. Ion cannon fully charged sir&quot;.
<br />&quot;Fire into the middle of the enemy ships!&quot;
<br />&quot;Sir!&quot;
<br />As the Ion beam was firing, several wings of nomad ships decloaked around the station.
<br />&quot;Damn! We don't stand a chance! Fire all torpedos, detach the Ion cannon and send it to New Berlin!&quot;
<br />&quot;Sir, our systems are jammed!&quot;
<br />&quot;Go into manual override!&quot;
<br />&quot;Right away!&quot;
<br />&quot;All enemies at Beta's coordinates are gone Commander!&quot;
<br />&quot;Beta here, our ships are back online, continuing to lay mines. What just happened?&quot;
<br />&quot;It's not over yet! get rid of the ships at Central control!&quot;
<br />&quot;Alpha, take care of them, we still have mines to lay!&quot;
<br />&quot;We're sustaining heavy damage! They're jamming our systems! We're defenseless!&quot;
<br />&quot;Alpha, we'll have to fire missiles and stay out of range&quot;.
<br />&quot;Hurry! Life support is failing!&quot;
<br />&quot;Fire!&quot;
<br />
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />&quot;Our last effort to protect New Berlin succeeded. But many lives were lost, but many more will be lost. That is the price we have to pay to defend ourselves. The Coalition will not succeed to run us out of our land like they did eight-hundred years ago! Now is the time! Now is the time we take our stand! Now is the time that we will prevail!&quot;
<br />Tremendous cheers are heard all around the Chanceller.
<br />&quot;For decades we have been worrying about the return of the Coalition. And now that they have; we will desroy them! All ships are to form wings and patrol the area. There will be no element of surprise for them! If you see any unusual activity you are to call in imediatly! You won't stand a chance alone. The Vice Chanceller and I have contacted the Corsairs. Rumor is that they have an advanced carrier capable of taking on the Coalition almost by itself. Also another rumor is that they have allied with the Outcasts and recovered pieces of the old Coalition Frontal Assault Battleships from before we were forced out of Sol and repaired them for the fight for Serius. We have also done this, we have taken the remains from the Eighty Years War and formed them into battleships more than three times as powerful as they were before. Together, WE WILL WIN!&quot;
<br />Just as the president said this, the sounds of ships docking with this massive station were heard. The corsairs have arrived. Battleships were everywhere. There were literally hundreds. Millions for the first time, saw what ships had drivin their ancestors from their homelands. In the distance, more ships could be seen, it was the Battleship Westfallen, which had been in the drydocks for repairs, followed by more than fifty ships no one has seen before.
<br />The Hispania has just docked with Odysseus, a giant station built by the Coalition that was taken over by the Rheinland Elite Navy. Orillian, followed by the Corsair and the Outcast leader, approached the president.
<br />&quot;So the rumors are true, you did team up with the Outcasts, and a little surprise too? The Order; I presume that you are the leader of this, Orillian?&quot;
<br />&quot;It has been long Chanceller. The Coalition has advanced jamming capabilities&quot;.
<br />&quot;We know that allready! We lost many ships because of it&quot;
<br />&quot;I will order my men to put a jamming block in your ships, you'll need it. I have a feeling that when they hit this time, they will hit hard.&quot;
<br />&quot;Starting ze party without me are we?&quot;
<br />&quot;Von Claussen!? I thought you were dead!&quot;
<br />&quot;No, a Nomad spy tried to pose as me.&quot;
<br />&quot;When I got back, I saw that thing dead&quot;.
<br />&quot;Where did you go in the first place?&quot;
<br />&quot;That information remains a secret&quot;.
