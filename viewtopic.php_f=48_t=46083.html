<br />
<br />Lylat is never at complete peace.
<br />
<br />It has been two years after Dash Bowman took control of Venom. His amazing oratory abilities have successfully driven the Venomians to reconstruct and revitalize their planet, turning it into an economic powerhouse second to only Corneria. While Corneria maintains the garrison around Venom under a 'protection' clause, the Venomian Liberation Force increases its size. Soon, it dwarfs the meager garrison.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, in the Sirius cluster, ace pilot Edison Trent successfully saves his people from an alien invasion by opening a vast system of hypergates. While this prevents the population in Sirius from being eliminated, it also opens up many new pathways across the galaxy. One such wormhole opens up near Liberty territory, engulfing a Liberty cruiser and its fighter escort.
<br />
<br />Upon exiting hyperspace, the cruiser encounters an unusual battleship with four wings and an arrow-shaped head. It opens a communications channel and history is made; for better or for worse.
<br />
<br /><i>That</i> was six months ago. 
<br />
<br />Dash Bowman declares war on Corneria and strikes the garrison hard. General Pepper is forced to retreat further and further. Meanwhile, General Peppy is in charge of the Lylatian Terminus, a sector of space surrounding the hyperspace gate that leads to Sirius. Trade between Lylat and Liberty had begun relatively early in the two clusters' history together. Unfortunately, the Liberty Free Commerce Corporation is anything but free; it controls all trade involving Liberty and is massive. Their military arm, the Liberty Expeditionary Force, patrols around the Sirius Terminus. The LFC is interested heavily in more trade with Lylat...perhaps even interested enough to invade.
<br />
<br />Of course, not all is well with the Sirius cluster internally. Liberty maintains a tight monopoly on lucrative Lylatian trade. Rheinland corporations, still reeling from the Nomad-induced war, badly want in on the markets. The star nation's military machine is already rumbling to life yet again; however, this time it is battling for its life. Without a boost to the economy, Rheinland will collapse. Skirmishes have already occurred in bordering systems.
<br />
<br />Sirius is again at war.
<br />
<br />
<br />StarFox: The Sirius Conflict is an RP-centralized modification for Microsoft's space simulator Freelancer. It is a blending of standard Freelancer trading and exploration and StarFox's pitched combats. The sides will be balanced against each other, allowing no massive advantages of Lylat over Sirius (or vice versa). Exploration will be encouraged with new systems and updates in regular intervals.
<br />
<br />Our mod already has a working version with functioning starships, systems, factions, encounters, etc. We are attempting to move to the next level towards a public release (currently we are just internal) with the addition of more models. Flying around with a home-made Wolfen II is okay for us, but the general public will want to see more than the little thing we threw together out of boxes and vertex editing in 3dsMax.
<br />
<br />We currently need a modeler with the following traits:
<br />	- must have some sort of interest in the StarFox series
<br />	- must be able to model from source material/work from source material to create variations
<br />	- preferably be able to skin/texture their work from source material
<br />
<br />Having a portfolio of your work is preferable. You needn't worry about hardpointing or conversion; we can handle that. Initially, your talents will be used to model various ships from the StarFox series, including the Wolfen II, Great Fox, Cornerian fighters, Venomian fighters, etc. We also can, in many instances, provide you with 360 degree views of the model in question.
<br />
<br />We currently need a texture artist with the following traits:
<br />	- must have some sort of interest in the StarFox series
<br />	- must be able to skin/texture models from source material
<br />
<br />Having a portfolio of your work is preferable. Initially, your talents will be used in conjunction with the modeler to texture starships. Future assignments include planets, asteroids, star backgrounds, etc.
<br />
<br />If you're interested, just drop us an email at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:redxiiie3@yahoo.com">redxiiie3@yahoo.com</a><!-- e -->. We'll be sure to get back to you rapidly.
<br />
<br />Thank you for reading this far,
<br />
<br />The StarFox: The Sirius Conflict Modification Team
