<br />
<br />Lance James/Barracuda/West Point/BHG/Guildmaster
<br />
<br />After docking with West Point, the Ioda wing disembark from their ships.
<br />
<br />Lance: Im gonna go take care of businees. Get some repairs and whatever else you need. Meet at the dock in 1 hour
<br />
<br />All the wingmen go about there business. Lance finds the communicator room and talks to a guard.
<br />
<br />Lance: My name's Guildmaster Lance James of the Bounty Hunters Guild. I believe I've been given clearance to use your communicator.
<br />
<br />Guard: That's right.(punches in the lock code)  Go right in
<br />
<br />Lance sets Sheffiled Station's frequency on the communicator. The image of the station's CO appears on the screen.
<br />
<br />Lance:This is Guildmaster James to Sheffield station. Do you read?
<br />
<br />CO: This is Sheffield to Guildmaster James. We read you loud and clear
<br />
<br />Lance: Sheffield, be advised, the BAF has determined out allegiance. They're gonna knock at your door sooner or later
<br />
<br />CO: They're already here. We're holding up, but I don't know for how long
<br />
<br />Lance: Sheffield, The LPI allowed us access to Manhattan. Pack up what you can and cleat out.
<br />
<br />CO: Roger, but it's not gonna be easy. Sheffiled out.
<br />
<br />With that, Lance ends the transmission and heads towards the bar.

<br />&quot;Calm down with our cloaking devise they wont see us espesaly in the bad lands&quot;

<br />After a short flight to west point the two cloaked crusaders positioned themselves over the academy
<br />&quot;Carful&quot;Rich instructed
<br />Together they opened there caro holds and jettesoned to fusiond bombs wich magneticly attached themselves to the outer hull of west point. There task completed they flew to join the Bretoinian strike force at buffalo base.
<br />
<br />As they pulled up at the closest battleship they saw a blinding flash were West Point used to be all that remenned were a few fragments of hull that could hold survivors Rich wondered if this war was worth it and if there were any survivors of the act they had just commited.........</div>

			<div class="content">Enrico/no ship/Planet Manhattan/blood dragons
<br />
<br />i go to the shipdealer and looked for a nice ship...
<br />still have the time around...
<br />
<br />i asked him what ship he have and he told me that he has only 3 new ships and a lot off old 2nd handed ships...
<br />
<br />i looked first at the new ships... the patriot looks nice, but not sure...
<br />
<br />then i looked between the 2nd handed ships and wrecked ships...
<br />
<br />i saw an good old dagger between thus ships... a kusari dragon next to it and a total wrecked falcon on the other side...
<br />
<br />i asked what happend with the dagger and what happends with the dragon.
<br />
<br />the person who want to sell ships on manhattan;
<br />&quot;the dagger was used by a junker with stole it from an outcast. but it can be that the outcast was death by to less cardamine... the junker was stand holded at manhattan planet for smuggling artifacts to manhattan. i have the ship still here, for the first one who want to buy that ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />ship broker;
<br />&quot;the kusari dragon was from a kusari navy with owned his own ship... however he had a lot off loans around, and sold his ship to a bounty hunter who needded a better ship. this bounty hunter came later to new york system to havoc around by the criminal bases... he killed a lot off criminals that day, but his ship was to damage to repair in a short periot... but still then was the ship not capable enough to maintain all the good things off the real kusari dragon.&quot;

			<div class="content">(Note: Yeah... I know... long time since my last post, and I know this one's a doozy.  But I've been busy with work, so deal.  Anyway, here goes.  I'm playing mega catch-up along this one post, so... use your imagination.)
<br />
<br />Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Newark Station/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />Edwards groaned as he tractored in the last of the escape pods floating around the hulks of West Point.  He didn't like this at all.  California was lost.  Texas was falling.  He knew the New York system would be next.  The destruction of most of West Point was proof of that.  Although, he couldn't understand why the Bretonians would be rash enough to attack the installation.  It was a military <i>academy </i>, not a forward outpost.  There were mostly young adults on that station.  Countless many of them dead now, floating adrift the vacuum of space; the remainder floating around in the escape pods.  Fortunately, he was not alone.  Most of Chief Constable Alistair Grey's BPA squadron had accompanied him to this point.
<br />
<br />Earlier, when Edwards had entered Magellan out of San Diego, he found an enormous force of BAF Crusaders and Liberty Rogue Bloodhounds waiting for him.  Frantically, he'd hit his thrusters, avoiding the torrent of fire that they'd unleased upon him.  And then, as if divine intervention had stepped into play, a voice had spoke out among the torrent of radio chatter from the Bretonians: &quot;Red Flight, engage!&quot;  In a scene of surrealism, the dozen BPA Cavaliers opened fire with Skyrails and Rippers upon the combined BAF and Liberty Rogue swarm that was chasing a lone LPI Patriot.  Glad for the support, Edwards came about and had pressed the attack as well, his Justices opening up on the horde as well.  In the midst of the confusion, about four Crusaders and five Bloodhounds fell before they began to get organized.  While the Cavaliers covered Edwards, he'd transmitted the lockdown codes to the California Jump Gate.  Like a godsend, he saw any ambient lights coming off of the gate dim down to nothingness.  It had worked.  The California Jump Gate was shut down.  But now there was a new problem: he needed a new way out.  He knew heading to the Cortez System was out of the question.  That left him one other option: he'd heard about a disused jump gate between Magellan and New York.  That could work.  Once there, he'd need to get to the California Jump Gate there, hoping to stave off any rushes by the Bretonians and Rogues from California.  So after the police fighters grouped as one, and dropped an immense field of mines and countermeasure flares, they engaged their cruise engines and sped away.  Finding little pirate resistance along the way, they managed to get to the Magellan Jump Gate.  Edwards used his codes to shut down that gate after they'd gone through it as well.  For now, no more Bretonian forces could push into Liberty through Magellan.
<br />
<br />When they'd arrived in New York, they found the Badlands unusually quiet.  That quiet was shattered when they saw the flare.  In the direction of West Point.  Speeding that way, the dozen Cavaliers led by a single Patriot arrived at the wreckage of West Point, finding most of the central superstructure in flames and pieces.  Distress signals were emanating from various points along the largest pieces of the hulks.  Edwards and Red Flights 1 and 2 worked to retrieve as many of the escape pods as possible.  Two ships from Red Flight 3 headed for the California Jump Gate to warn the defending Liberty forces there of the incoming onslaught from California, while the other two headed for the Battleship <i>Missouri </i>, advising them of the impending attack from Texas.  Fortunately, after their stories were corroborated with Edwards transmitting across the Neural Net, Defenders were dispatched to both jump gates to disable their entry gates on the other sides.  The Cavaliers returned to West Point with other Defender escorts to grab the remaining escape pods.  The hodgepodge group of rescuing fighters sped off for Manhattan, dropping out of the trade lane next to Newark.  After countless repeatings that the BPA Cavaliers were not under direct Bretonian command, they were granted landing clearance on Newark Station.
<br />
<br />The Bretonian Police Officers met Edwards on the landing deck.  Surprisingly, they were met with welcome hearts as they entered the bar, most if not all of the patrons grateful that they were able to save so many survivors from the West Point wreckage.  The remains of the installation were evacuated for now.  At the moment, the biggest news was that most of the Liberty Navy and Police forces in Texas and California were pulling back to New York, amassing at the Texas and California Gates.  For the sake of humanity though, the Bretonians had made a de facto agreement with the Liberty Police forces in Texas not to open up the prison stations in that region.  They knew prisoners in those stations would easily attack both Liberty and Bretonian forces.  So the Bretonians kept well away from the <i>Huntsville </i> and <i>Sugarland </i>.  What's more, the Bretonian occupiers were remaining well-mannered to the Liberty civilian population, for now anyways.
<br />
<br />As the BPA officers and Edwards sat at the bar, ordering up glasses of Liberty Ale, they were joined by a welcome sight: Edwards' Blue Flight had landed on Newark after pulling out of California.  What's more, many of Blue and Red Flights had worked on operations in Cortez and Magellan before.  They were glad to see each other.  It was perhaps the oddest sight in the midst of this sudden war between Bretonia and Liberty: to see LPI and BPA officers carrousing in a bar near Manhattan.  One could see that the few Navy officers in the room looked a little uneasy at the sight, but were keeping their peace for now.
<br />
<br />After a while of relaxing, talking, and drinking, Edwards had received a call on his Neural Net.  Taking Grey in tow, the two of them made their way to a public comm console, receiving a call from LPI Chief Adam Lewiston.  Needless to say, the chief was surprised to see a BPA Chief Constable there, but under the circumstances, they needed all the help they could muster.  The fact that the Bounty Hunters Guild was not under LPI employ was proof enough of that.  They were told that under new resolutions from Congress, all LPI forces were remanded to the command of Admiral Baldwin, head of the Liberty Navy.  And they were already receiving orders: meet at the Battleship <i>Missouri </i> in preparation for an attack on Buffalo Base in the Badlands.  Grey instantly volunteered his flight to join them, and Lewiston was not one to object to free reinforcements.  After returning to the bar and rallying their pilots, Grey and Edwards made their way to the hangar bay as their squadrons' pilots began to head for their fighters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who'd have thought it'd end up like this, hm?&quot; Grey asked as the whine of engines began to increase.
<br />&quot;I certainly didn't,&quot; Edwards replied.  &quot;Look, Al... I appreciate what you're doing here.  I really do.&quot;
<br />Grey gave Edwards a look of humor.  &quot;Think nothing of it, Nate.  Besides, I know you'd do the same for me if Jacobi flipped her lid and came against us.&quot;
<br />Edwards smirked.  &quot;Probably.&quot;
<br />Grey began to move towards his Cavalier.  &quot;Let's get moving.  I have a few calls to make along the way.&quot;
<br />
<br />After enough pre-flight checks, LPI Blue Flight and BPA Red Flight made their way from Newark's hangar bay, a glorious sight to see a mass of Bretonian and Liberty fighters streaking for the trade lane to Fort Bush.  They were on their way to Norfolk Shipyard.
<br />
<br />It was time to make a stand.</div>

<br />Leion was heading to badlands, alone, his mission was to scout out the area before the attack on the badlands. The fact Leion's ship was a dagger help him with his mission as outcast were knowen to fly in there as well.
<br />When he reached the edge of the badlands he checked his 2 catpults and his 2 vengance were ready to fire on command.
<br />he contined on into the deadly field. as he was half way to buffalo when a britonia partorl spoted him.
<br />
<br />&quot;undetefied dagger disengauge you cruise edgnes while we scan your ship&quot;
<br />Sh*t Leion thought
<br />&quot;roger&quot;
<br />&quot;Dagger were did you get your weapons&quot; the caution in pilots voice very clear.
<br />&quot;Got them off a librity partrol&quot;
<br />&quot;He's a scout, get him!&quot;
<br />F*ck
<br />Leion spun his ship around and let his lasers rip at the cruisedars
<br />he magaged to get behind one and start hit with unimagabule actucry and in 20 seconds the 1st one was down. The 2nd had engauged his cruise engenes and was make a run for buffalo base.
<br />&quot;this is razor 1-1 we need to attack NOW. Buffalo will be alarted soon. &quot;Leion said with serprising calmy.&quot;I going to harass the base, this will give you the oppertunet to sprise the enemy, but I will not be able to hold out long, out&quot;
<br />And with that he engauged his cruise engenes

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Norfolk Shipyard, New York System/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />The voice of the lead scout rang out over the comm almost clear as day: &quot;This is Razor 1-1, we need to attack NOW. Buffalo will be alarted soon. I'm going to harass the base; this will give you the opportunity to surprise the enemy, but I won't be able to hold out long, out.&quot;
<br />
<br />Edwards and Grey both knew that it was time.  Along with their two squadrons of police fighters, there was one more LPI squadron of Patriots, Gold Flight; two squadrons of Liberty Navy Defenders, Alpha Flight and Delta Flight; two Liberty Cruisers, Mt. McKinley  and St. Louis ; and to top it all off, the Battleship Oregon .  All in all, 12 BPA Cavaliers, 24 LPI Patriots, 24 Navy Defenders, two cruisers, and one battleship.  Oh yes... plenty of firepower.
<br />
<br />The comm came alive: &quot;This is Battleship Oregon .  All wings report in.&quot;
<br />Edwards chimed in first: &quot;This is Liberty Police Blue 1-1.  Blue Flight standing by.&quot;
<br />Grey followed after: &quot;This is Bretonia Police Red 1-1.  Red Flight standing by.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is Liberty Police Gold 1-1.  Gold Flight standing by.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is Liberty Navy Alpha 1-1.  Alpha Flight standing by.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is Liberty Navy Delta 1-1.  Delta Flight standing by.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is the Mt. McKinley .  We're standing by.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is the St. Louis , standing by.&quot;
<br />The Oregon 's comm operator came back on.  &quot;Acknowledged.  All craft report ready status.  Enter formation and prepare to engage cruise engines.&quot;
<br />
<br />The ships all took their respective positions.  The plan was relatively simple.  The Patriots and Cavaliers would hamper fighters defending Buffalo, while the Defenders and cruisers would open up with torpedoes and cannon fire on Buffalo itself.  The battleship would use its primary turrets to pound the base while the defensive turrets would also serve to take out enemy fighters.  It was a sound plan.  What's more, there was a group of two more battleships on standby in Zone 21, ready to head to Buffalo to reinforce them at a moment's notice.
<br />
<br />&quot;Engage!&quot;  And in tandem, 60 fighters and three capital ships engaged their cruise engines, streaking for the eastern end of the Badlands, for Buffalo.
