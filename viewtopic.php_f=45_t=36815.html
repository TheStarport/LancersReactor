<br />History as Follows in Roleplaying form:
<br />
<br /><b>The Zetas are a faction bent on Killing all that oppose. Somewhere around the time humans were just stepping out of the seas back on Earth, the Don'Kavosh civilation was thriving...and so was the Zetas Leader...SpAz. His given name in this time was Raziel, which he does not like being called. He was sent to Earth as a young child to learn from the creations of the Don'Kavosh...the Humans. The &quot;United States&quot; Government discovered that he wasnt of this world and took him from his earth parents and expermented on him. He then fled from earth and his true Don'Kavosh Father, sent him 200 Million years into the Past to stop the Don'Kavosh from creating the Rakzam, Humans, or Nomads. But he failed. 
<br />
<br />Once SpAz made it to the past. He set to try to convince his father in the past of whom he was and that he could not create the Rakzam. But SpAz once again failed to convince him and he created them. The Rakzam went crazy and killed 40 Billion Don'kavosh and over 200 cities. His father was furious. 
<br />
<br />His father then created humans to destroy the Rakzam. SpAz once again told his father to not do it. He ignored him yet again. And created Humans. Humans were a good creation. But did not surive in Sirius. His father put the seed on the Don'Kavosh's Holy Planet, Earth. Earth was the center of the known universe and controled the movements of the galaxys. Humans then started to crwal out of the Seas and forgot the Don'Kavosh. Some humans surived and killed many Don'Kavosh. Those escaped and formed colonies far from the Don'Kavosh empire. 
<br />
<br />Once again, SpAz's father was consumed with rage. He ordered the creation of the last creatures...The Nomads. SpAz had heard about these in the future and begged his father not to create them. Once again, he ignored him and created Nomads. They got lose and started a mass killing spree. They then left the planet and settled in 3 systems, 5 Lightyears away. 
<br />
<br />At this time the baby Raziel was born. SpAz's Father immideatly knew who SpAz was. His son from the future. He ranted on about why he didnt try to stop the creatures from being created. He was furious and left SpAz to stand alone in the corridor of the castle. 10 minutes later, his mother was killed by a Nomad still on the planet. His father consumed with rage, ordered SpAz killed at the Holy Alter of the Artfact. SpAz escaped and fled the Planet. 
<br />
<br />He then changed his name from Raziel to SpAz to live in hiding. He created The Zetas...the faction bent on making sure that no Don'Kavosh creation would ever take over sirius, the distruction of the Don'Kavosh Councils grip over SpAz...and to keep the only creations he ever got along with...safe...those creations...were the humans... 
<br />
<br />Now it is almost 1000 years later. SpAz never dieing, never aging...never wounded still stands as a reminder that Don'Kavosh used to rule over all creations in the galaxy. Although his rep is not good with many people, he has a small group of friends close at all times. And when he is attacked these people help him...destroy the infedels. 
<br />
<br />TZ is in the criminal areas of Asgard. Sticking to the shadows making money anyway they can. Weather it be through Card running or killing innocents in their frighters or ships. Confronting these piolts is not advised because anyone in TZ tells their leader. And their leader, attacks and kills that person. 
<br />
<br />Overall TZ are a dangerious faction...and mysterious. Not much is known of them except that they are dangerious and sometimes fun to be around if your a criminal because sometimes they just go kill random people. Join TZ today! And kill with out a care!  </b>
