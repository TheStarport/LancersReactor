			<div class="content">OK, funny man here....j/k, don't want to bloat....
<br />
<br />Ok, a man and his 3 daughters are all sitting in a car on the way to visit their aunt.
<br />One daughter says &quot;daddy, how did i get my name&quot;
<br />The dad replies &quot;when you were a just born, the doctor dropped a rose petal on you head, so we named you Rose&quot;
<br />Satisified, Rose is now quiet.
<br />Another daughter asks &quot;daddy, how did i get MY name&quot;
<br />the dad replies &quot;when you were a just born, the doctor dropped a daisy petal on you head, so we named you Daisy&quot;
<br />Satisied, Daisy is now quiet.
<br />the last daughter mumbles something that sounds like &quot;bawaaplsbwdsfplf&quot;
<br />The dad says &quot;shut the hell up Cinder Block!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />Three guys are sitting in a sauna, an American guy, a Japanese guy, and an Irish guy named Paddy
<br />Suddenly they hear a beeping noise
<br />The Japanese guy taps his ear and the beeping stops.
<br />The American guy says &quot;what was that&quot;
<br />The japanese guy explains that he had a cell phone implanted in his ear and he can turn it on and off by pressing his ear
<br />&quot;OK&quot; says the American guy
<br />5 Minutes later they hear a buzzing noise starts
<br />The American guy taps his wrist and it stops
<br />Paddy asks &quot;wtf was that&quot;
<br />American guy says &quot;Oh, I had a pager put into my wrist, its got all the controls in my wrist&quot;
<br />&quot;Oh,&quot; says Paddy
<br />Paddy starts to feel jealous, and like an Irishman he decides that he cannot seem inferior to the others technologically
<br />Paddy says &quot;hey guys, i gotta use the john&quot;
<br />So Paddy does as he says and heads to the john.
<br />He takes some toilet paper from the bathroom and sticks it up his butt, making sure it is nice and loose.
<br />He returns to the sauna with the toilet paper hanging from his ass.
<br />The Japanese guy starts to stare at him
<br />Noticing he's gotten some attention, Paddy puts on his most serious face and says &quot;Oh, guys, I'm getting a fax&quot;
<br />
<br />Let's see...oh yes...blonde jokes!!!!
<br />
<br />Three blondes are stranded on an island.
<br />One day they find a magic lamp
<br />They rub it and a genie comes out and grants them each one wish
<br />The first blonde wishes for a rowboat so she can get off the island
<br />KAPOOPH!!And a rowboat appears
<br />The second blonde goes up and wishes for a motorboat to get off the island
<br />SPAZAAM!!And a motorboat appears
<br />The third blonde goes up and wishes to be a Brunette
<br />KAZOOM!!She turns into a brunette and walks across the bridge
<br />
<br />OK, not a blonde joke but funny
<br />
<br />Three guys are climbing a mountain
<br />The legend of the mountain says that if you make it to the top and jump off the mountain you will turn into whatever you yell out.
<br />Eventually, they make it to the top
<br />The first guy runs jumps off the mountain and yells out Falcon!!!
<br />He turns into a falcon and flies away
<br />The second guy, seeing the success, leaps off and yells out Eagle!!!
<br />He turns into an eagle and soars off
<br />The third guy, now all alone, backs up as far as possible and starts running as fast as he can
<br />As he nears the end, he trips over a pebble and yells out &quot;Oh S**T!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />A guy walks into a bar on the 12th floor of a hotel, we'll call him Jay.
<br />This guy calls him over, we'll call the guy Stan
<br />So Jay walks over to Stan
<br />Stan is sipping a blue drink and Jay curiously asks what it is
<br />Stan replies &quot;Magic Wine&quot;
<br />&quot;Oh yeah, right, Magic Wine&quot; says Jay
<br />No really says Stan
<br />Oh yeah what can it do, asks Jay
<br />Stan replies, it allows you to fly
<br />Jay, knowing Stan must be crazy, says ok, lets see
<br />So Stan says yeah ok, and leaps out the window, flies straight forward then turns around and comes back into the bar.
<br />Jay says,&quot;ha, that was rigged, do it again&quot;
<br />So Stan, again leaps out the window, flies forward, then does a flip,turns right, flies down, then back up, then turns left, then comes back to the bar.
<br />Jay, now a believer says &quot;Bartender, I'll have what he's having&quot;
<br />The bartender says &quot;Yeah, OK, whatever&quot;
<br />Bartender serves up Jay.
<br />Jay drinks some Magic Wine and leaps out the window
<br />AHHHHHH!!!!!!AHHHHHHH!!!!!
<br />AHHHHHH!!!!!!AHHHHHHH!!!!!
<br />SPLAT!!!!
<br />The bartender looks out the window, sees Jay lying there dead, then turns to Stan and says
<br />&quot;Damnit Superman, you can be such a dick when you're drunk!!&quot;</div>

<br />&quot;Yesterday Christy Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced that she's resigning. Reportedly President Bush was shocked because he didn't know that there is an Environmental Protection Agency.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;As part of the anti terror campaign the government has declared the air space over Disney theme parks 'no fly zones'. The news came too late for Tinkerbell who was shot down by an F15.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Today the United Nations approved a resolution to lift the sanctions on Iraq. The move will allow Iraqis to build things they don't have such as medicine and weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The 'New York Times' reporter who resigned after being accused of plagiarism may be paid as much as $1 million to tell his story in a new book. Not surprisingly, the book will be called, 'The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The California Senate has approved a bill that would give users of medical marijuana special ID cards designed to protect them from arrest. The ID cards will be available by November 1st, and the fake ID's by November 2nd.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Last night, baseball hero Sammy Sosa was ejected from a game for using a corked bat. As a result, major league baseball immediately confiscated all of Sosa's bats and gave them to the Mets.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;In Texas, a truck-driver was arrested when police seized more than 3000 pounds of marijuana from the back of his truck. In a related story, the Phish concert in Austin has been cancelled.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;According to the New York Post, the A&amp;E network is making a movie about Senator Hillary Clinton and they want Sharon Stone to play Mrs. Clinton. Which explains why, Bill Clinton volunteered to play himself.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;This weekend the Yankees play the Cubs at Wrigley Field for the first time since the 1938 World Series. When they heard this the cub fans asked 'What's the World Series?&quot;
