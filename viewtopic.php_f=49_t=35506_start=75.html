			<div class="content">I will see him, when I wish it, is that understood?&#8221; the command had finality to it and to hammer it home, the choke hold intensified almost to death, before releasing. Inform the Admiral, that I will see him in my quarters in one hour&#8221;. The dark master let the captain drop to the deck, gasping for air and exited the landing bay. As she did so, the captain relayed the message and the report to the admiral, as ordered.
<br />
<br />On the bridge, controls changed, coordinates entered and he ship jumped to hyperspace, minus its protective squadron of fighters. The crew could not change it and guessed who was doing it and stood back until control was returned to them.
<br />
<br />As the two entered the quarters, a blue energy overloaded the cameras and monitors while the second person set up the equipment to give a fake view of what was going on. Then the blue energy was gone. It appeared to the bridge crew that the two people were meditating and nothing unusual happening. The two could now confer, with out watchful eyes seeing them. They sat at a table and laid out the strategy and what they would do when they dropped out of hyper space. They had timed it out well, and the Imperial fleet would soon be destroyed, with out the Admiral knowing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Darkstone, follow my lead in dealing with th Admiral, no matter what I have to do, ok?&#8221;Carla asked, voice calm and steady.
<br />
<br />Darkstone nodded is agreement. He knew she had to play the part all the way, or this thing was over. It was apart of him as well. &#8220;I will follow your lead&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />There was a &#8216;Bleeep&#8221; at the door. &#8220;Enter came the reply. Both had their hods up and faces mostly covered when the admiral entered. He move to kneel before he and spoke, &#8220;what if your bidding, my master&#8221;. The Dark one motioned for him to be seated n a chair that slid over from the wall. Both  the others sat on chairs opposite of him. Then there was knock at the door and it slid back to reveal the new captain of the ship. The Admiral was about to address the breach in protocol, but hesitated when he felt the force restraint. The Captain moved in front of the Admiral, without so much as looking at the two other people in the room.&#8221;Admiral, the ship has been set on hyper space jump and we can not get it to drop out, do you know of a cause of it, Sir!&#8221;	
<br />The Admiral never moved a muscle. But the captain grew more agitated and asked again, why as the ship in autopilot and not under his control. The two others now rose and stood side by side. The male spoke to the female, &#8220;Master, shall I deal with this one?&#8221; The woman merely nodded. A hand came up and the captain was flung at the bulkhead. As he slit down the wall, a light saber came out and flashed as it was sen flying across the room and cut the an in half and returned to the hand that sent it. It was reattached to the belt just as quickly. 
<br />
<br />The pair sat back down and resumed the discussion and plans that were interrupted. Within an hour, the plans were laid out to the understanding of the Admiral and he left to set them in motion and ssignaled to crewmen to remove the body of the former Captain and to call WW2jacob to the bridge, immediately.
<br />
<br />After the body and men were gone, the two lowered their hoods. They both seemed more tired for the adventure than either of them would admit. They hated to have to have killed the captain, but, it would have caused concern if they had not acted as they did and would cause suspicion that they could ill afford.
<br />
<br />They would arrive at Geonosis soon and could find out what else the empire had in mind for the republic. What ever it was, it would be hard to deal with it, if not from behind the scenes. This mission had to succeed , at all cost.
<br />
<br />Jagged paced in his  cell. He knew he had to get away from here, but when would these republic types let him go. He gave them the information to take out a good size of the fleet. He had to get away before either the Admiral or the Dark Lord got to him. He was in the prison mess hall later in the day when he saw on a monitor, Darkstone and Carla training together. He hollered out for a guard. If she was this close, he had to leave now.

			<div class="content">Jagged paced in his cell. He knew he had to get away from here, but when would these republic types let him go. He gave them the information to take out a good size of the fleet. He had to get away before either the Admiral or the Dark Lord got to him. He was in the prison mess hall later in the day when he saw on a monitor, Darkstone and Carla training together. He hollered out for a guard. If she was this close, he had to leave now. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you want&#8221; cam the reply of a guard, more tired than angry.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Is the Dark Lord here, at this base&#8221; fear and agitation shook Jagged, &#8220;She&#8217;ll kill me when she finds out I talked, you got to get me away from her, Now!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />The guard put in a call and told the prisoner that someone was on the way to talk to him. This did little to calm him down. Even in the video, he saw the same anger in the eyes of her that he saw onboard the ship. The anger that drove her and caused her to hurt the Admiral. He wanted nothing to do with her or the force. He had to escape, or ......
<br />
<br />Master Esquilax arrived to speak with Jagged in less than an hour. He heard about what was said and wanted to investigate it personally. He was worried and needed to know more about Carla, more than he knew. On arriving at the cell block, medical personnel were running the same direction. He picked up his pace and arrived at the same tie. Jagged lay on the cell floor, burn marks on his hands and an open panel near the lighting circuits. He looked as if he tried to electrocute himself, but a groan proved other wise. Not dead after all. But, Esquilax now wanted to know why he feared Carla this much.
<br />
<br />Locutus and a stranger were in conversation over Corrilian ales. He was here to gather what information there was on the remnant and their movements, and if anyone had any word on the new Death Star. He wanted to get what he could to hep the republic. If it fell, then people like him would be hunted down and killed. He wasn&#8217;t a smuggler anymore, but had honest trade going  and he liked it that way. He and Han had a business to run now, more than ever.
<br />
<br />The strange little alien he was talking to, seem more afraid than credits could buy. Locutus offered triple the going rate, and the creature would barely speak of any news. It took five times the rate and promise of transport off the planet to get him to open up. But, he did reveal that he had left a ship a week ago that, as it left a minor rim system, had seen the Death Star drop out of hyper space as they jumped out. It had frightened the captain of the ship, that they jumped three more times before they were satisfied that they weren&#8217;t followed. That trip ended here. The captain sold the ship and bought another and eft as quick as he could. The one though, had been left behind and was found hiding.
<br />
<br />Locutus got the information that he needed and took the informant aboard the Star Princess and headed for Hoth. He needed to meet some friends then would look up the remaining Jedi.	He wanted to get word to Han as well and have hm fly the Falcon to meet up with him. A Wookiee of Chewie&#8217;s family, had found Han and swore friendship to him for all Han had done for Chewie. His name was Kashann, and like others of his kind, favored the Bowcaster. He was a young adult, but wise in the world. 
<br />
<br />Sitting at the com panel, locutus raise Han and the Falcon. They would meet up on Hoth, even though Han hated going back there. Too cold , he said. That made locutus laugh. But, He thought back on what had happened there many years ago. They nearly lost Luke and the Empire killed many of the Alliance fighters. It was a bad time for the rebels that ultimately brought about the new Republic. But, they did survive and now, they were fighting to hold on to the Republic.</div>

			<div class="content">Locutus got the information that he needed and took the informant aboard the Star Princess and headed for Hoth. He needed to meet some friends then would look up the remaining Jedi.	He wanted to get word to Han as well and have hm fly the Falcon to meet up with him. A Wookiee of Chewie&#8217;s family, had found Han and swore friendship to him for all Han had done for Chewie. His name was Kashann, and like others of his kind, favored the Bowcaster. He was a young adult, but wise in the world. 
<br />
<br />Sitting at the com panel, Locutus raised Han and the Falcon. They would meet up on Hoth, even though Han hated going back there. Too cold , he said. That made locutus laugh. But, He thought back on what had happened there many years ago. They nearly lost Luke and the Empire killed many of the Alliance fighters. It was a bad time for the rebels that ultimately brought about the new Republic. But, they did survive and now, they were fighting to hold on to the Republic.
<br />
<br />The frigid cold, as warming as it had been before. It was a time that had brought Han and Lea together in the first place. Now, though, it was a place of emptiness. The rebel base was still operational. It held a skeleton crew that kept it running, and more hidden than before. The remnant would have a hard time finding it this time. Locutus set the Star Princess down next to the Millennium Falcon and another ship. It was of Jedi Design. One that had not been seen for over a hundred years. 
<br />
<br />Locutus waited as the Falcon lowered its ramp and Han walked out. 3PO was with him. Han had finally gotten use to the droid and welcomed the company. Together the three of them headed to the command center. It had long been dug out after the AT-AT walkers had nearly brought it down around their ears before. It even seemed a little warmer inside to. In the command center, a number of droids were busy with tasks of keeping the systems working at the peak of perfection.
<br />
<br />A young robed woman was at the scanners, checking readings and sending reports out. &#8220;Have a seat gentlemen&#8221; she spoke, pointing to a couple of chairs near by. She had not even looked their way, yet seemed to know they were here and why. As she turned in her chair to face them, her robe was opened and showed she was wearing a light saber. So, Han thought, other Jedi survived the destruction too.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Captain Solo, a few of the Jedi dd survive, though we are less than half te numbers we were.&#8221; she answered the unspoken question. &#8220; My name is Athena, and I am a Jedi, trained by Master Skywalker himself.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;More like a Jedi Master, if my sources are right&#8221; Locutus spoke, a wisp of a smile on his face. He always wanted to get one up on the Jedi. Athena gave a deferential nod in acknowledgment. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I was here when the Remnant destroyed the other Jedi.&#8221; she began, then she reached for a file and handed it to Han and continued, &#8220;the woman in the picture was the one responsible for Luke and Lea&#8217;s death, but, I have not ben successful in locating her. The folder held the picture of Carla, with another man in the far back ground. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, I know, she&#8217;s my daughter, Carla&#8221; Han hesitated, emotion growing, &#8220;But, thanks to Darkstone, she is a Jedi again and I have reunited with her.&#8221; He struggled and finally got control. &#8220;She was on the darkside, but, Darkstone was able to rescue her and bring her back.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You had a daughter?&#8221; Athena asked, incredulous. &#8220;My information was that your daughter died when she was a baby, but this woman, are you sure she is her?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Han nodded his head and locutus picked up the conversation, &#8220;She was trained in the darkside, and her anger at her parents seeming betrayal of her fuel the move to the darkside.&#8221; pausing, he continued the report of all that was now known. He explained the fleet commands, the training of an apprentice and he defeat at the hands of Darkstone. At the mention of an apprentice, Athena looked shocked, and clicked a couple of buttons bringing an image on the screen. It was of Neo_Kuja and another man, though he was hidden in the shadows a little.
<br />
<br />Locutus had not seen any pictures of the man, but from the report, he fit the description. And he said as much. &#8220;The younger man in the picture, is or was a student of the other man, I had been researching both when they disappeared two years ago&#8221; Athena reported. 
<br />
<br />The story was taking an eery turn now, one Han was not looking forward hearing about. But, for the sake of Carla, he would need to find out who had been training her and why. 
<br />
<br />The information on the other figure, was sketchy at best, only that he was from Naboo and had been reported to be dabbling in the Jedi arts. He was view by others as not dangerous, but was worthy to be watched. Then he disappeared twenty five years ago, until the picture of himself with Neo_Kuja. It became apparent now, that he had force abilities and was using them for the darkside. It was even rumored, that he was the late emperor&#8217;s son, though there was no stock put in that. The ramifications were to terrible for that to be true.
<br />
<br />True or not, he may be the threat behind it all now, But, I believe that Carla was not the only one being trained to be a sith&#8221; Athena spoke, her voice and tone, grave.
<br />

			<div class="content">Amazing story. I'm a bit out of touch here though, I just skipped most of the story I plan to correct this sometime. It looks like I'm going to get killed though and I'll need to go find out why the dark master is on a Republican whatever. OY! I just had  agreat idea. Sure lightsabers are great and all, but I think someone should be equipped with a new prototype of one(say Captain Jagged of the super Star? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>). Well anyways I as I restarted reading through the story again I noticed that FD(or is it Fd? Or fd? I can't remember) used the word blade to describe the lightsabers. That got me thinking &quot;well what if we put light sabres into different shapes o different types of swords?&quot;. Thing about it, the lightkatana <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Ok so the name isn't good but I'm just saying that it might be neat if we changed the lightsaber sinto different types of swords like a greatsword or a dagger. Might be something for you to play around with FD.

<br />True or not, he may be the threat behind it all now, But, I believe that Carla was not the only one being trained to be a sith&#8221; Athena spoke, her voice and tone, grave.
<br />
<br />Jagged came to in the medical ward. He was strapped in and a droid over saw his recuperation. He wanted to get out, to escape, but he could not. The door slid back and Master Jedi Esquilax walked in. He pulled up a stool and sat next to the bed and waved the droid, Too-onebee and it headed back to the med station. &#8220;Jagged, isn&#8217;t it&#8221; Esquilax asked. His smile was disarming, yet, Jagged was still on edge. The pain he had in his hands was reduced to a dull pain. He had received the sedative moments before. His hands were rapped to prevent infection. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;The woman I saw on the monitor, she isn&#8217;t here is she?&#8221; Jagged asked, drugs beginning to take effect.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No she isn&#8217;t, but how do you know her&#8221; Esq asked gently, needing the answers. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;She was on my ship, a Super Star Destroyer, her and the Admiral.&#8221; he explained, She disciplined the Admiral and it seemed, to help for a while, he was less cruel to me and others, but, he was covered on metal. on parts of his head.&#8221; Jagged grimaced in the recalling of it, &#8220;She also went over to the Death Star and from what I heard, had a &#8216;Talk&#8217; with the commander there too.&#8221;
<br />
<br />This triggered a memory from the Jedi. One that was not pleasant, one that recalled the destruction a many millions of people. It troubled him so, that the one cause was again a Jedi, or maybe it was that justice, was stayed this time. He didn&#8217;t know, yet, he had his fears of what was yet to come.
<br />
<br />Darkstone and Carla were back in character as they entered the Super Stars bridge. They arrived, just as the massive ship dropped out of hyper space at Geonosis. The Dark Lord ordered a shuttle prepared for her and her disciple and to await her return in the next few hours. Moments after the shuttle departed, the Admiral took a holo call from a robbed and hooded male. He would have ginned if he had been able to. He would have his revenge, soon. Danger was ahead for the pair. 
<br />
<br />The trip to the surface was un eventful. They landed at the arena that was the place of a battle many years ago between the separatist and the new clone army. Ironic, that the emperor was the one behind both sides in the battle. He had caused so much pain and anger, just to put himself in power. Now, it was happening again. History repeating itself, though, these two were determined to prevent it this time. They had much work to do, some f which, was easier to implement. They headed to the assembly area for the massive starships. They keyed up the computers, and adjusted some of the components settings, that would cause all new engines installed, once they go to full power, to over load and destroy the ships.	
<br />
<br />That would slow things down for a little while and take the researchers a long time to figure out the problem and correct it. But, until they did, havoc would be had on the fleet.
<br />
<br />Now, they had a harder task, to locate and get aboard the Death Star. That, would prove the most difficult of all. They headed back to the shuttle and left the planet. Once docked, they left obit with orders to head to the Death Star. The admiral was more cordial than expected, which set Carla on alert. She knew that something had change, something the Admiral knew and made him feel more powerful. They headed to their quarters to preplan things and she, so she could let Darkstone in on things. Then she would have to eliminate the Admiral.

			<div class="content">Now, they had a harder task, to locate and get aboard the Death Star. That, would prove the most difficult of all. They headed back to the shuttle and left the planet. Once docked, they left obit with orders to head to the Death Star. The admiral was more cordial than expected, which set Carla on alert. She knew that something had change, something the Admiral knew and made him feel more powerful. They headed to their quarters to preplan things and she, so she could let Darkstone in on things. Then she would have to eliminate the Admiral.
<br />
<br />Master Athena, while n meditation, saw an event unfolding. A large space battle, where much life was to be lost. It was at the planet of Geonosis. She saw bounty hunters chasing a ship through th asteroids. A fleet dropping out of hyper space near by. She shook her self. She was still not se to getting these visions, but, she learned to listen to them and act. She got Locutus and Han and Kashann together and explained the best she could and asked Locutus to take them in his ship to Geonosis, as soon as possible. But, she did not tell them of the two people she saw, not yet. She had much thinking to do first.
<br />
<br />Han himself was glad to be away from the cold. Getting older had not helped things. But, he felt himself, that this was to be a battle and had Kashann and himself check out Locutus&#8217;s ship guns. They wanted to be ready for anything. They were not too unlike the ones on the Falcon, just faster. He got it down really quickly, for an old man, as Locutus kidded him about. They did make a good team, and now, with Kashann by his side, he felt the loneliness not nearly as much anymore. He could never replace Lea in his heart, yet, he had family around him now, and that felt good.
<br />
<br />Locutus looked over at Athena. He really did not know what to make of her. She seemed more formal or ridged for a Jedi, but, that could come with being in the position of being a Master at it. He would ask her later about it. But, for now, he would keep his blaster by his side and she her Light saber. Better a weapon you know, Han always said. He checked the settings one more time and leaned back in his seat and nodded off for a short one. They would need to be ready and alert when they arrived.
<br />
<br />Two bounty hunters, Gunblader and Roc. The picked up the bounty order from the remnant Admiral two weeks ago. Execute and bring the heads of Han and Locutus. Failure would mean their own heads, but, success, would mean two million credits. They saw it as easy money, and, headed to the location provided them. An asteroid field circling Geonosis. They would lay in wait for the prey thy said was on the way. Roc&#8217;s toothless grin spread ear to ear, while the mech arm of Gunblader twitched. He would get theat repaired after this. 
<br />
<br />Twelve hours later, a alert signal told Locutus they were nearing the coordinates and he prepared to cut in the sublight engines. Han and Kashann headed for the gun deck. They would be ready for what ever trouble that showed up. Hopefully, he thought, it would not be the death Star. That, was more than he could handle, no mater who was on board. He reached up and toggled off the hyper engine and the sublight kicked in. He arced toward the planet, scanners on max. he launched a probe that could pick up EM waves. It arced out over the field. 
<br />
<br />Roc as the first to see the probe, he called Gunblader on the Com and asked what to do about it, it would see them soon .Gunblader&#8217;s answer was to blow it out of space. Which, alerted Locutus and company to their presence. It was foolish, but with the bounty on those people, he and Roc could make short work of them and hit the thrusters. They pealed right, heading through the field to mask them and get close enough to disable the ship. They had to have two heads to get paid.
<br />
<br />Athena, war warning of sorts, pointed to the flash a second before it happened and suggested they get moving quickly. Locutus was already on it. Thrusters fired and he was off into the field himself, weaving in and out f the asteroids paths. He needed surprise to get close enough for Han to take them out. It would be a contest to see who got the advantage first. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone did not sleep any, but set about meditating on their present circumstances and for direction on how to get out alive. He and Carla would need all the help the Force could provide to pull this off. He had a deep down feeling that something was wrong, he just couldn&#8217;t put his finger on it. He dressed and clipped on his saber and realized Carla was not their. In his meditation, he had not noticed her slip out of the quarters. She would be taking things in her own hands, despite his warnings to stay together.
<br />
<br />He closed his eyes and relaxed. He saw her, walking down the corridor, straight towards the Admirals quarters. He had to get to her before she steeped into something, that was growing worse. His feeling of impending doom was growing now, as was a dark presence from the other side of the force.</div>
