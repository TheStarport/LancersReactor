			<div class="content">considering alot of people think the world could be better (me being one of them)
<br />and some people when asked what would they change talk alot about changing the world to suite there life, not a ideal society.
<br />if you could rewrite your life, who and what would you be? and how would you effect the world? 
<br />
<br />Me? i'd probably get lots of computer game making skills and escape the real world. Cus i dont think one person could REALLY change the world without tons of people helping him. also often those who change the world for better or worse  give up there life (literaly and non-literaly) to change the place. no matter what people say i prefer my created world to the real deal.

			<div class="content">If i could actually change the way my life has been......wow well here is a list..
<br />
<br />a.) i Would have not hit the joint, pipe and snorted up at age 10 and been a marijuana,heroin,acid,and coke addict till i was 21 all the while being an alcoholic like my pathetic old man who drank from sun up till sun set.
<br />b.) Never would have ratted my dad out to teh cops for beating my ass for 10 years of my life and getting him thrown in jail for the better part of a decade and losing my entire family to that.
<br />c.) Wouldn't have dropped out of H.S as a drugged out loser and left everyone i knew to go to a new state to RUN from my BS problems for 3 years to just come back to them all.
<br />
<br />With those MAJOR things changed and all the substance abuse choices reversed, i would have presued my CAD and Drafting skills further to become that architect i wanted to be ever since i was a child. And build the first &quot;Arcology&quot; like in Sim City 2000 <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> cause that would be the s***. 
<br />
<br />But, this is reality and there is no way i can push the metaphorical &quot;rewind button&quot; and relive the past and fix the things i have done to ruin my life and what others did to hurt me. But i am GLAD i did what i did and experianced what i have because it makes me ME and unlike anyone else....(well I think...i have a feeling there is another &quot;me&quot; in the world...i mean there ARE 6 billion people on this planet<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) So it is a great thought, but not something worth dwelling over since it has no bearing on reality...true reality suckx for most but i am willing to have &quot;comfort&quot; rather than &quot;false hope&quot;.

			<div class="content">so why the Stones reference?
<br />
<br />i'd be exactly who i am. I have no idea the potential i have at the moment. When im 80 i'd probably be at a better stage to make a choice. At the moment im happy where i am and sure, im bitter about missed opportunities, staying in when i should have gone out, not asking certain girls out, spending money on a new computer isntead of going on holiday, holding back on something i wasnt sure of and then regretting it almost instantly. But those experiences are the ones that made me who i am. I've learned from everything ive done. If i went back and changed something, my whole world outlook could be different. Hell, if i was more of a risk taker back when i was younger, i could be dead right now. In fact i know of a certain situation when i was drunk that if i HADNT fallen back on my natural instinct of playing it safe, i would be very much dead. But then who's to say i would even be in that situation to begin with.
<br />
<br />I guess what im saying is. The choices and the situations i've made have decided who i am as a person. Changing them wouldnt make me, me so if i'd have studied law at college instead of computer programming, i'd be at a high class university with a part time job as an intern somewhere making cash hand over fist. No desire to help people because i dont know what being poor feels like, i dont hang out with common people anymore so why do i care about them. I'd have lost touch with reality and become an asshole...or maybe not.
<br />
<br />Given the ultimate choice of who i want to be in a perfect world. I'd want to be the Prime Minister. I'd believe, like alot of people, that my decisions are sound and that a bit of logical thinking and common sense as well as a bit of descencey would be all you need to make the world right.
<br />
<br />as for attainable goals. get my degree in game development, get a job making games for some independent company for a few years then start a games company which makes all my fantasies into games. THEN spin off into a multimedia company which also makes films and spend the rest of my life directing independent films.</div>

			<div class="content">If I could rewrite my life I would have worked as hard as I could at school. I also would have sought immediate treatment for the depression which began in Intermediate school. The removal of that influence would have meant top marks at school, better and increased number of friends, a social life, I would not have missed out on so many opportunities and never developed the rage and hatred. Basically I would be a totally different person were it not for that. And when the time came when I finally found out a certain thing about myself I would be much better equipped to handle it.</div>

<br />but as for a bit more reality...I can't think off anything about myself that I would like to change, not at the moment in anyways...my past made me who I am
<br /> Oh well...the only thing I'd really really like to change now is actually two things 
<br />1) Be a genuis that I dont have to go study for science
<br />2) Have a photo graphical memory that I dont have to struggle to memorise all the laws and formulas for science
<br /> 
<br />oh and a third one...that I just get full marks for both my science papers and dont have to go write them...

			<div class="content">I have been looking for the reset button on life for a long time. Haven't found it yet. But, what I did find was conclusion. If I changed even on point in my life, trying to fix an area, and replied that part, I would still be where I am today. I would not have the beifit of the experiance I have, good or bad, and would still have other choices thrown at me. 
<br />
<br />The thing I have concluded now, is, when presented with a choice, weigh it out, and make the best one.  I have so much wanted to change what happened 20 years ago, thinking it would be better, but, I would have missed some of the good points that helped change the current things. 
<br />
<br />Oh well, such is life. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
