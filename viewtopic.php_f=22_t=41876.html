<br />Greetings Evolved Ones!
<br />
<br />The Evolved Mod Development Team is proud to make our latest version of the Evolved Mod available to the public. It has been thoroughly tested and has been running on our server for over a week now. In version 1.1 you will experience:
<br />
<br />- Improved server stability
<br />- Improved power capacity and regeneration for Interceptors
<br />- Improved maneuverability for Multirole Fighters
<br />- Unique engines and power generators for each ship
<br />- Rebalanced power drain on all weapons
<br />- Rebalanced ship stats and performance for greater diversity AND equality between fighters
<br />- New custom rumors and news for Corsair and Junker bases
<br />
<br />There's never been a better time to Evolve. Our players agree, the new ship settings have passed with flying colors. One of our hardcore dogfighters has even mentioned the need for a separate character for each ship since he cannot decide which one he likes the best!
<br />
<br />Forget everything you though you knew about combat on Evolved, because on our server running version 1.1, Combat HAS Evolved. At Evolved, we are committed to continuous improvement. Even now that V1.1 has been released, work has already begun on V2. We even have some holiday surprises in store for the folks during V1.1!
<br />
<br />Join us on Evolved 24/7 RPG Server and see for yourself! We pride ourselves in being the friendliest and strongest gaming communities out there. It's all about our players, and our mod development will always reflect that. Come see what the power of community is capable of in the best roleplay environment in Freelancer. The time has come. Are you Evolved?

			<div class="content">Greetings, Evolved Ones!
<br />
<br />Work continues on the Evolved Mod v2.0 featuring our Dynamic Economy and Updater system which will transform our server into a truly evolving Freelancer universe. Right now we are building our rough alpha of the mod and we hope to begin beta testing our work within a week or two. Soon we will be accepting volunteers to serve as testers.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the RP keeps rolling right along. We have several newly formed factions on our server and it's great to see new folks coming in all the time. We're hoping to get some more regular server events running again now that our event emcee is back.
<br />
<br />As we get closer to v2.0 release I will post more information on some of the new features and content that you will see in our latest version. Until then, I can tell you that all capital warships will now be included as well as several new fighters and freighters from our up-and-coming shipwrights. Our systems team has come up with some great new locations to explore in Sirius including some new race tracks to challenge our speed demons. The feature I am most excited about is our new dynamic economy which tracks cargo that has been bought, sold, and mined and adjusts prices daily based on supply and demand. With this system in place we will also be able to make other content additions and changes on the fly, and our goal is to provide monthly or even weekly updates to the Sirius Sector that mimic the In Character activities of our players.
<br />
<br />Things are definitely heating up on Evolved and I look forward to releasing our work. Every day brings us a little bit closer to realizing the full potential of the work we did in the initial Evolved Mod release.

<br />
<br />Greetings Evolved Ones!
<br />
<br />Evolved Mod v2.0 release is getting closer and closer. The next beta build will be out later this week. We fully expect this beta to be the last one. After that, final preparations will be made for public release!
<br />
<br />Now that the release date is in sight, I'd like to share some more information with you about what to expect in this new version of the Evolved Mod.
<br />
<br /><b>SHIPS        </b>
<br />We've been blessed by the fact that Evolved v1.x attracted some of the best up-and-coming shipwrights in the Freelancer community. They gathered at the Shipwrights' Guild on our forums and delivered <b>34        </b> new flyable ships for the mod. Some are new custom fighters and some are unlocked vanilla capital warships and transports. Along with the 53 custom ships introduced in v1.x, the Evolved Mod v2.0 features <b>117        </b> flyable player ships.
<br />
<br /><b>SYSTEMS, BASES, and FACTIONS        </b>
<br />Our systems designers have been busy creating brand new worlds to be explored in version 2.0. Combined with the groundwork laid in v1.x, the Evolved Mod now has <b>268        </b> dockable bases, 61 more than the original vanilla. Additionally, v2.0 introduces <b>5        </b> new systems bringing the total systems to 64, 11 more than the original 53 included in vanilla Freelancer. Three of the new systems are occupied by the new Aztec faction, which will be making its presence known to the more well established Sirius factions over time. Also, the Sigma systems have united and declared their independence. The Federal Republic of Sigmas now patrols the clouds of those previously independent systems.
<br />
<br /><b>DYNAMIC ECONOMY        </b>
<br />The most ambitious aspect of the new version of the Evolved Mod is the Dynamic Economy. Server programs will monitor each commodity bought and sold throughout Sirius and will calculate new prices for these goods each day based on supply and demand. The economy starts with the extraction of minerals from the asteroid fields. These raw materials are delivered to bases that can process them into basic goods. From there, they can be taken to factories that will use them to create higher-level goods that sell for even better prices. If a base has not received shipments of a needed good for some time, it will cease to produce the higher-level good it produces and the price they are willing to pay for the raw materials goes up. We feel that this new economic model has the potential to revolutionize the way people play Freelancer, and we look forward to watching this system perform for the masses.
<br />
<br />
<br />More information will be forthcoming as we continue the march towards public release. For those of you who have visited our web siteseeking information on the release date, I can only tell you we are close and getting closer by the day. I don't like to give exact dates, but we're working towards release within two weeks of this post.
<br />
<br />On behalf of the entire Evolved Mod Development Team and the Evolved Admin/GM Team, I'd like to invite you to stop by our forums and say hello. The most up-to-date information about the mod, the server, and the community can be found there. We look forward to seeing you! It is our hope that the Evolved Mod v2.0 delivers the best Freelancer multiplayer experience available, and we thank every member of our community for helping make it possible.

			<div class="content">Greetings Evolved Ones!
<br />
<br />I'm please to present to the Freelancer community the latest version of the Evolved Mod v2.1. The last public version that was advertized on Lancers Reactor was v1.1 which laid the foundations of the version we play today.
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.evolvedones.com/files/EvolvedModV2.1.zip.flmod' Target=_Blank>Click here</a>
<br />
<br />This version includes many new ships, including all vanilla capships and several utility ships and, of course, a multitude of new custom fighters from our gathering of up-and-coming shipwrights. Also included in this version is our Dynamic Economy. Daily updates to the market files ensure that you won't be running the same cargo every day. Each commodity price is governed by supply and demand as well as the availability of raw materials to the base that produces it.
<br />
<br />These changes are managed by the DynEconUpdater, a program that launches Freelancer automatically after downloading the market files. This system can also handle content updates on-the-fly without the need for a character wipe or a redownload of the entire mod.
<br />

<br />
<br />[u<b>DynEconUpdater v1.2 Installation Instructions:[u </b>
<br />
<br />Additional: Read the readme
<br />Please follow the the instruction step by step.
<br />** IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER, WE CANNOT HELP YOU IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS**
<br />
<br /><b>1. Preparation: </b>
<br />
<br />1.1. Write down your MP-ID. Reinstall a fresh copy of Freelancer
<br />
<br />1.2. Install Freelancer Mod Manager
<br />
<br />1.3. Install the V2.1-Mod in the mod-folder of FLMM (double-click the downloaded v2.1 flmod file)
<br />
<br />1.4. Activate the Evolved Mod v2.1 in FLMM
<br />
<br /><b>2. Installation: </b>
<br />
<br />2.1  Start of the installation
<br />     The installation-files are compressed in a zip-file. 
<br />     You'll have to decompress the files into a folder.
<br />
<br />2.2. Start the setup-file by double-click
<br />     I suggest to keep every file, which is newer then the 
<br />     files of the installation !
<br />
<br />2.3. The installation-routine will install a program, which will 
<br />     download a couple of FL-files from an ftp-server and store 
<br />     them into the mod-folder of FLMM and, if chosen, in the FL-folder. This is the preferred method.
<br />     The links to start the updater and the options-window are in 
<br />     the start-menu:
<br />     start -&gt; programs -&gt; DynEconUpdater -&gt; DynEconUpdater
<br />
<br /><b>3. If you have never installed the DynEconUpdater before: </b>
<br />
<br />3.1. First run of the uploader
<br />During the first startup of the downloader, the program will ask you 
<br />for some informations.
<br />Here is an example for an English-language computer in standard:
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.joshandchristi.net/evolved/UpdaterOptionsExample.jpg' Target=_Blank>Click here</a>
<br />
<br />With these settings, the Updater will update the mod-folder, 
<br />the freelancer-folder and start freelancer after a successful download.
<br />
<br /><b>4. If you previously used Updater Vers. 1.1: </b>
<br />
<br />4.1. Uninstall the Updater from the start-menu
<br />     start -&gt; control panel -&gt; add or remove programs
<br />     There you'll find the entry for the Updater
<br />
<br />4.2. Start the new install
<br />     Read additional the remark under 2.1/2.2 of this guide
<br />
<br />4.3. Start the updater with the options-window
<br />     start -&gt; programs -&gt; DynEconUpdate -&gt; DynEconUpdater-Options
<br />
<br />4.4. Check the paths, e.g. for the version 2.1
<br />
<br /><b>5. Faction-related files: </b>
<br />
<br />If you are member of a faction with special faction-equipment, 
<br />the faction can activate these things with a special file. 
<br />This file is called Faction-Filecontrol.
<br />To use this, ask your faction-leader for the name of this file
<br />and the password.
<br />
<br /><b>5.1. Activation Faction-Filecontrol: </b>
<br />
<br />5.1.1. Activate the option-window
<br />       start -&gt; programs -&gt; DynEconUpdate -&gt; DynEconUpdater-Options
<br />
<br />5.1.1. set the marker Load faction-filecontrol
<br />       Then, the 2 inputboxes below this marker are free for input
<br />
<br />5.1.2. Give the password and the name of the file.
<br />       Example:
<br />
<br /><a href='http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3102/optionsupdaterfcfact8yp.jpg' Target=_Blank>Click here</a>
<br />
<br />5.1.3. Close the window with save&amp;exit or save&amp;start
<br />
<br />If you have not run the Updater, you will be unable to connect to the Evolved 24/7 RPG Server. I suggest allowing the updater to launch Freelancer by checking the &quot;Direct Start of Freelancer after download&quot; box in the options menu.
<br />
<br />That's it. You are ready to play...ALMOST!
<br />
