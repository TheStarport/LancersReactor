			<div class="content">Oohh - I got caught on the doorstep by ScottishPower - who spent twenty mins with the hard sell. They got me to check out a price comparison website (they were two smiling 20 year old patronising perverts), and were smugly trying to show how much they could save me. They were right - around 80 quid a year.....but when i went to the independant energy website - Powergen could save me a ton thirty a year. I went back downstairs and thanked them profusely for showing me the light.............then told them that i was going for powergen. They were not even slightly amused - they got all that attitude going and stuff. Funny that.....partonising is supposed to sell the power to us somehow - i really don't get it. I wasn't going to sign with them simply BECAUSE they were patronising...whether it cost me money or not, i didn't care. Would check out the sites by the way - can make a nice saving as long as you know how much your average bill is of course. Powergen make some/most of their own power - hence they aren't increasing prices yet....and might not do either!
<br />
<br />As for the card, i took into consideration what you said, went back and saw the 9800 pro one for a ton thirty i think it was - and was thinking of going with that. There was another one that was 77quid - but only had 4 tubes instead of 8 or whatever that means. I guess thats half of something relevant to performance though....so I will probs go with the more expensive one instead of the cheaper one. My housemate needs a new HDD too - so we maybe getting him one, although he will be IDE instead.
<br />
<br />For the cards, I just don't get the differences between all the numbers (9000,9200, 9500, 9600, 9800) - but I think i maybe able to stretch. Order will probs be lodged next week (tues) for a weekend arrival hopefully.

			<div class="content">Warning! Warning! The second card is one of those bloody dodgy &quot;SE&quot; cards that is a bloody cheap trimmed-down version of a proper card that runs at significantly reduced speed. That's why they are cheap. The 128-bit memory interface and reduced number of pixel pipelines are the main problems. I hate it when they rename stuff to &quot;Special Edition&quot; and reduce the quality of the card in order to dupe the average person into buying them! Conniving bastards! I hate them so much!?!? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">the rabbit-headed one is 100% accurate - do NOT get the SE version, I repeat do NOT get the SE version. get Pro or XT. if you're going to ATi, that is. as far as the numbers are concerned, the higher the number the later the version, that's all. why not just tell us how much you're actually prepared to spend, what you want, and we'll tell you if you can do it and what to get? as far as i can see its 250 notes and you want a hdd, 17&quot; tft and a decent video card, is that right?
<br />
<br />(i got British Gas one day, Powergen the next, Scottish power the next. since privatisation all this has become a nightmare. it should have stayed just the Gas Board. Noo Labour promised to put all these privatised utilities back under public ownership, but never did. now we don't even know where the money goes and the MEB still owe me &#163;240 from 5 years ago, which I aint never going to see))</div>

			<div class="content">Well - yeah, you got the money right. About 250 - 300 notes MAX (note the max on the 300!). Originally i was going TFT, but that would mean i couldn't get anything else for months! At that point, apart from deskspace, i won't really notice the difference that much between the two....and I really am not bothered (just thought i would treat myself to looking s****y with a monitor <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>). The others were born out of necessaity..when someone said ANY card better than mine would improve performance....and my monitor is SO bad that the text is actually blurry. I kid you not - its a REAL headache maker. I never noticed as my eyes &quot;Autostrain&quot; to get it in focus....which is why this whole thing was starting orginally!
<br />
<br />Monitor is the must have, and hard drive.
<br />After that - as long as the graphics card shows an image on my new screen or decent quality (my decent - not your idea of decent!) then i don't worry too much. 
<br />
<br />The easiest way to figure how i am about things is that i won't buy a DVD player until i actually own a television and audio setup that is actually going to ALLOW me to notice the difference in quality over my present TV <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. Basically - i am no connesieu......connesi.....perfectionist of presentation (or spelling).
<br />
<br />
<br />*edit* - the four stars are for a knaw letter <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I'm certainly looking for new video card too.  I'm not looking for the most powerful video card out there.  I'm sick and tired of having to buy budget cards like the Radeon 9200SE that I have in my machine right now.  My next video card has to have at least 256 megs of RAM in it.  I want to go ATI, but NVIDIA will do in a pinch.

			<div class="content">ATi 9600XT or 9800 Pro, Nvidia as long as you avoid the lower-end budget FXs (like the 5200, complete cr*p) You'll get a decent mid-to-high end card for about that. Whatever card you do get, cooling is terribly important. The stock fans that come with cards just aren't man enough to do a good job, so I strongly recommend a decent vga cooler if you have the space for one. shouldn't cost more than a few dollars, Tom.
