<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article2874112.ece">http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/ ... 874112.ece</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />The secret of Wikipedia's phenomenal success is that anyone can edit the millions of comments, facts and statistics published on the pages of the world's most popular online encyclopaedia. But that of course is also its greatest weakness. 
<br />
<br />The chance to rewrite history in flattering and uncritical terms has proved too much of a temptation for scores of multinational companies, political parties and well-known organisations across the world. 
<br />
<br />Now a website designed to monitor editorial changes made on Wikipedia has found thousands of self-serving edits and traced them to their original source. It has turned out to be hugely embarrassing for armies of political spin doctors and corproate revisionists who believed their censorial interventions had gone unnoticed. 
<br />
<br />Some of the guilty parties identified by the website, such as the Labour Party, the CIA, Republican Party and the Church of Scientology, are well-known for their obsession with PR. But others, such as the Anglican and Catholic churches or even the obscurely titled Perro de Presa Canario Dog Breeders Association of America, are new to the dark arts of spin. 
<br />
<br />The website, Wikiscanner, was designed by Virgil Griffith, a graduate student from the California Institute of Technology, who downloaded the entire encyclopaedia, isolating the internet-based records of anonymous changes and IP addresses. 
<br />
<br />He matched those IP addresses with public net-address services and helped uncover the world's biggest spinning operation. 
<br />
<br />Mr Griffith says: &quot;I came up with the idea when I heard about Congressmen getting caught for white-washing their Wikipedia pages. Every time I hear about a new security vulnerability, I think about whether it could be done on a massive scale and indexed. I had the idea back then, I've been busy with scientific work so I sat on it until a few weeks ago when I started working on the WikiScanner.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Wikipedia says Mr Griffith has found something they had long suspected. A Wikipedia spokes-man said: &quot;Wikipedia is only a working draft of history, it is constantly changing and so relies on volunteers editing the pages. But deliberate attempts to remove facts or reasonable interpretation of facts is considered vandalism. We are dealing with this kind of thing all time, so that our volunteer workers are changing edits back when we think they should be changed. But it's not perfect, it is just more transparent than some people realise.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Wikiscanner has analysed a database of 34.4 million edits performed by 2.6 million organisations or individuals since 2002. 
<br />
<br />Although it is not known who made each individual edit, or how senior that person was within any organisation, Mr Griffith says it is fair to link the change to the owner of the computer's IP address. 
<br />
<br />Exxon Mobil and the giant oil slick 
<br />
<br />An IP address that belongs to ExxonMobil, the oil giant, is linked to sweeping changes to an entry on the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. An allegation that the company &quot;has not yet paid the $5 billion in spill damages it owes to the 32,000 Alaskan fishermen&quot; was replaced with references to the funds the company has paid out. 
<br />
<br />The Republican Party and Iraq 
<br />
<br />The Republican Party edited Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party entry so it made it clear that the US-led invasion was not a &quot;US-led occupation&quot; but a &quot;US-led liberation.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The CIA and casualties of war 
<br />
<br />A computer with a CIA IP address was used to change a graphic on casualties of the Iraq war by adding the warning that many of the figures were estimated and not broken down by class. Another entry on former CIA chief William Colby was edited to expand his cv. 
<br />
<br />The Labour Party and careerist MPs 
<br />
<br />An anonymous surfer at the Labour Party's headquarters removed a section about Labour students referring to &quot;careerist MPs&quot;, and criticisms that the party's student arm was no longer radical.</div>

Although I am not sure as to the exact edits I suspect that non-American, not-Nasty-Global-Corp interests are just as guilty of such spinning and the omission of this from the article is in itself a form of spin.
<br />
<br />Just my humble.<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />EDIT: I enjoyed <a href='http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/lbktukI5tugLax/New-Tool-Outs-Would-Be-Wikipedia-Tricksters.xhtml' Target=_Blank>this one from Linux Insider</a> which did not cite as detailed a set of examples but does tell the reader how to use the system for themselves.
<br />
<br />To be fair, most articles I found on this list the same culprits and of course, changes made by poeple or goups with other motives who have less tracable IP (be it terror groups or just individuals) are also an issue so where some groups may be performoing edits they may not be seen.
<br />
<br />Naming the big guns like CIA, Exxon and the US Gov is just good print and sells papers though so it is still a little tongue in cheek that they print those names and then accuse them of spin.<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<h3><a href="#p426614" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I was reading about this a while back and it made me laugh then. I think Wikipedia is awful, although it was originally an interesting and worthy idea. However the very principle that anyone can create and edit an article on anything is always going to be fraught with dangers, and the volunteer Wikipedians are as guilty of bias and blinkered thinking as anyone else. At best, Wikipedia manages knowledge by consensus, not fact; I've caught out several articles in areas of interest to me that are factually in error, edited them right, only to be accused of vandalism, and no amount of fact will persuade the resident Wikipedians in charge to put it right again.
<br />
<br />Some of the articles are frankly so self-serving it's preposterous, a form of self-advertising that agin, simply because of this ideology of consensus and the lack of qualified and capable moderation means that blatant abuse of this &quot;encyclopedia of everything&quot; which isn't supposed to carry advertising, actually does.
<br />
<br />One only needs to check out the talk pages and version edits to see how partisan and fractious some of these &quot;discussions&quot; get, although for inveterate keyboard warriors in their mum's back room I suppose it's an arena of combat and honour, quibbling about domestic vacuum-cleaner trademarks or the accepted size for a milk-bottle top, and whether the past participle of the verb &quot;to spell&quot; is &quot;spelled&quot; or &quot;spelt&quot; - hence why I tend to call it &quot;W4nkipedia&quot; - you can quote as many sources and authorities as you wish but if the precious Wikipedians don't like what you're writing, true or not, you won't see it. 
<br />
<br />it didn't surprise me at all to find out that the Authorities and their servants and hangers-on have been creatively editing Wikipedia entries on subjects dear to their hearts, or that conversely anti-establishment lines have been inserted into articles in order to denigrate the subjects. Is an article about George &quot;Dubya&quot; Bush or Tony &quot;Trust Me&quot; Blair <i>not</i> going to be creatively &quot;vandalised&quot;<img src=smilies/icon_smile_question.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> This is where Wikipedia really falls down; it's bad enough when dealing with standard encyclopedia fare such as iconography in the paintings of Piero della Francesca, but when it deals with current affairs in the news or popular culture, it just becomes a teenage w4nk<i>fest</i> for p*ssy opinions. 
<br />
<br />The only good thing i can still say about Wikipedia is that it can be a good starting point for finding out more about a topic, but other than that, it's basically rubbish.</div>

			<div class="content">well this is exactly the kind of petty bickering I dislike so much. <i>Everybody</i> knows that the internationally accepted size since 1976 for milk-bottle tops is ISO7435 diameter 42mm, which supeceded the former standard BS1301 diameter 1+9/16&quot; originally adopted in 1851. However as per usual despite the rest of the world having been prepared to accept a British Standard measurement, Americans insist on maintaining their own perverse measurements of 1+5/8&quot; which is a full 1/16&quot; at variance with the former British Standard and even more at variance with the current international ISO measurement. Hence why we can't export milk bottles to America, a classic example of institutionalised protectionism if I every saw one! 
<br />
<br />And I hope that settles that argument once and for all! Remember this ain't no Wikipedia - you can't edit posts but I can!*
<br />

			<div class="content">Its not all that hard to figure out why....
<br />
<br />
<br />History hurts, it always has hurt, and it will always hurt, spindoctors love te online propaganda machine as it gives them a means to unabatedly spout their rubbish perspectives over the hapless proletariat, and even more so the dumb bourgeoise idiots who take wiki as the law.
<br />
<br />Wiki is exactly the reason why I seek out Ed on matters entailing with his specific areas of interest and expertise, same as how I seek out Druid on his knowledge of Irish History, I seek them out because I love to hear their views on a common fact, their take on what they think is history, these are two biased parties in discussion, not one idiot proclaiming the law from a high throne, which is what wikipedia is portraying to be.
<br />
<br />All too often I hear people say: &quot;Wiki said it, so it must be right!!11one!eleven&quot; It does not cross these people that all they have to do is open 3 books, 3, on one particular topic, and cross-examine. For sure, all conflicting facts can just be shrugged off as historical doctoring, don't forget, History is always written by the winner.</div>

			<div class="content">Everyone faults those who cite to the Wiki as if it were an authoritative reference.  And yet everyone uses the Wiki for a quick write up on what's what about a topic hitherto unknown to them.
<br />
<br />I noticed that censoring and played around with it before they tightened up the editing and tracking.
<br />
<br />I picked a known name in the liberal world and looked up what was written.  Most of it was partisan character assassination.  So I went in and edited.  Added actual factual information and stuff not to eliminate the partisanship but to expand upon the circumstances to lay out more about the dispute.
<br />
<br />It kept growing as I would add and someone else would go in an either delete what I'd put in or make subtle changes to spin what I contributed into a negative attack.
<br />
<br />This kept up for about two months, off and on.
<br />
<br />In the end, someone finally stepped in and locked it up and deleted almost everything except for a bland and neutral comment about who that person was in terms of occupation, title and things authored.
<br />
<br />It was an interesting experience.</div>

			<div class="content">What are they moaning about? Make it so anyone can edit it, then moan when anyone does?
<br />&quot;Freedom of speech&quot; and all that jazz.
<br />
<br />Don't moan on about it when companies or others may edit something though, because if I found an article saying i was a c*** - I don't think i'd laugh and move on, i'd probably change it to say I'm awesome and available to hot ladies who are seeking a night of r... an evening of... five minutes of randy passion!
<br />
<br />okay, two minutes - but who's counting <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
