			<div class="content">Alistair Grey/Cavalier/California Jump Gate, Magellan System/Bretonia Police Authority
<br />
<br />(Note: Figured I might as well give the Bretonian constable a life of his own, and I know a new Bretonian was needed, so... here we go.)
<br />
<br />Chief Constable Alistair Grey of the Bretonia Police Authority was not a happy man at the moment.  Right now, his entire world consisted of the brig cell he'd been confined to on the BAF <i>Yorkshire </i>.  He figured this might happen though.  Sending an encrypted communique to an LPI captain was bound to attract attention.  He just didn't think it'd attract the attention of Admiral Winston, the commander presiding over the invasion of the California System.
<br />
<br />As he heard the klaxons continue to sound on the ship, Grey felt empty.  This felt wrong.  Even if he did answer to the Crown of Bretonia in the end, it still didn't sanction the invasion of another House in Sirius.  He'd tried to prevent Admiral Winston from conscripting his BPA Cavalier squadrons into the battle, but that didn't happen when a pair of BAF security officers arrested the constable on charges of &quot;high treason against the crown.&quot;  With a charge like that, Grey knew it was only a matter of time before he was sent to Prison Station Newgate, or worse executed by a BAF firing squad.
<br />
<br />Looking through the glowing forcefield, he gazed over the pair of security officers on duty sitting at the control desk.  He knew they didn't like him.  If they had their way, they'd toss him out an airlock at their earliest convenience.  There never really was much animosity between the BPA and the BAF, not as much as there might've been in the Liberty equivalents of the organizations.
<br />
<br />Suddenly, the blast doors from outside the brig opened, and three uniformed BPA officers stepped inside... stun-sticks at the ready!  One of the security guards cursed as he tried to reach for his gun.  But the three BPA officers had closed the distance across the room in mere blinks of an eye, tapping and stunning both security guards with the large, bulky wands.  One of them worked the master console at the desk, soon enough deactivating the forcefield holding Grey in his cell.  He stood off of his bench and stepped out, approaching the other three officers.
<br />
<br />One of them saluted Grey.  &quot;Sir, we've managed to... delay Red Flight's launch, but we can't keep it off for long.  And these guards won't stay knocked out forever.&quot;
<br />&quot;Right,&quot; Grey said, nodding as he came to the weapons locker, taking four blasters out and tossing one to each of the officers.  He checked the charge on his.  &quot;Set weapons on stun.  These are our countrymen after all.&quot;  They all complied and rushed out, sprinting down several decks to the hangar bay.  Resting on the flight deck, now devoid of BAF Crusaders, sat twelve BPA Cavaliers... eight of which were active and waiting, the remaining four belonging to Grey and his three liberators, the remainder of Red Flight 1.  Not questioning orders, the pilots entered their fighters, powered up, and began to move towards the hangar doors.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Bretonia Police Red 1-2,&quot; Grey's wingman announced.  &quot;Requesting permission to launch.&quot;
<br />&quot;About bloody time,&quot; the coordinator on the bridge replied.  &quot;You're clear to launch, Red Squadron.&quot;
<br />Smirking, Grey keyed his comm.  &quot;All right, gentlemen.  We launch, and then we make for the California Gate.  Evans?&quot;
<br />Red 2-4 responded.  Evans was a crack computer systems specialist.  &quot;Yes, sir?&quot;
<br />&quot;Once we're there, you're to try to tap into the jump gate's systems.  See if you can disable the gate, keep our boys on this side, clear?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />&quot;All right then, let's move.&quot;  The hangar doors were open by now.  The twelve Cavaliers streaked out one after another in quick succession, making for the California Jump Gate immediately.  For now, there were only two squadrons of BAF Crusaders, but four more squadrons of Bloodhounds.  Liberty Rogues.
<br />
<br />Grey felt tense now.  He knew they might not succeed, but for the sake of all those civilians in California, he knew they had to try.  As they made their way towards the gate, passing the queued invading fighters, things seemed eerily quiet.  No one seemed to pay them any heed, not even the Rogues.  Finally, Red 2-4 got close enough to the jump gate to tap into its systems.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, unless I have the seizing codes, it's going to take me five minutes,&quot; Evans had reported.
<br />&quot;Get started,&quot; Grey replied, watching the waiting fighters tensely.
<br />
<br />Suddenly, a new alert sounded over the open channel.  &quot;Red alert!  Liberty fighter entering system!&quot;  Grey checked his sensors and paled at the readout:
<br />
<br />Liberty Police Red 1-1.
<br />
<br />Edwards!
<br />
<br />And 24 Crusaders and 48 Bloodhounds were now starting to wake up and bear down on the Patriot.</div>

			<div class="content">Keith Glyde/Liberty Navy/Cortez system/Defender
<br />1 months ago. For some reason, he didnt know why, he thought it may be a semi-decent idea to land on manhatten. &quot;Big mistake&quot; he thought as he was running back to his sabre, turns out, the very same outcast he had stole the sabre from knew him well and flew off with it &quot;Great, get shot or run to god knows where on this forsaken police base.&quot; He ran around a corner and got shot in the leg. After been taken to medical he had 2 choices, live and fight in a defender as the liberty navy (this would badly mess up hes ties back on crete, should he escape) or die right there (what do ou expect, he did kill 36 piolets). He kinda took the deal.
<br />Now he finally got away, well, from the navy that is now he has a bigger problem, the lane hackers have been chaseing him all over the place he quickley went through the majellen jump hole, but that brought on more of them. he knew that the hackers wouldent want to follow him too far in britonia, but wasent there a war going on? well, it looked like there wasent much to lose, it the pathetic bounty hunters wasent trying to kill him anymore, and the hackers were trying to kill him, then it must mean that InflatableBeerTent the pirate, was a bounty hunter, or a cop. he didnt know or care now. he finally got into leeds and drove to sector 4F, he knew he would lose them there, or he would lose his other wing.</div>

<br />
<br />Lance blows a cloud of smoke from his mouth and rubs his cigarette butt into an ashtray as he sees an LPI officer approaching his table.
<br />
<br />Lance: So.... I take it you reconsidered
<br />
<br />LPI officer: Unfortunately. Looks like the pirates are with the Bretonians in this one. Hell, they're storming California even as we speak. (pulls out a credit chit) Here's the advance. Hurry to California.
<br />
<br />Lance takes the chit and then jogs to the spaceport, gets into his Barracuda and activates the comm device.
<br />
<br />Lance: This is Ioda 1-1 to Ioda wing. Everyone meet near Trenton we got ourselves a contract.
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-2: Roger that. ETA 10 minutes
<br />Ioda 1-3: Already at Trenton. Launching now...
<br />Ioda 1-4: Launching from Newark. ETA 5 minutes
<br />Ioda 1-5: Understood. ETA 15 minutes
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Planet Manhattan to Bounty Hunters Ioda 1-1. You're cleared to launch. Good flying&quot;
<br />
<br />As Lance approaches Trenton, he sees his wing waiting for him and cuts his cruise engines.
<br />
<br />Lance: Congrats people. The Bounty Hunters are officially employed by Liberty in this war. We are to go to California and help defend it. Any questions?....Good. Everyone activate you cruise engines and enter formation.
<br />
<br />With that, the Ioda wing activate their cruise engines and set course for California

			<div class="content">Jack Simmons/Dagger/Liberty Rogues
<br />
<br />  Jack sat down at the bar, his dagger was in for repairs and he needed a drink anyway after a day's cardamine running.  He knew all about it, the war and all, and wondered how it would end up.  If Bretonia won, he would have a much harder time in his endeavours but, equally, if Liberty emerged victorious, he was sure Jacobi would stab them in the back if they helped her.  It had happened before.  He would not help Bretonia but he was no patriot either.  His mind was made up: life would continue as normal.
<br />
<br />  &quot;Er..., fella; you've been sitting there for ten minutes.  Buy a drink, or get out,&quot; said the bartender.
<br />
<br />  &quot;Oh...oh yeah, I'll have a Fireburst,&quot; he replied.
<br />
<br />  Liberty was a police state these days, what with the nomad crisis.  Smuggling artifacts was now harder then getting cardamine from A to B, for god's sake.  He would rather not touch the stuff, but money was money, especially in these hard times.  His Fireburst was ready, and it tasted good.  Just as he continued brooding over the matter, his friend Max came in.  Max was just fitting into his new life at Buffalo, and only had a Bloodhound, but Jack could see that he had talent, and might prove useful.  Both of them shared a devotion duty and had never failed a mission yet.  The boss liked that, and the boss liked them.
<br />
<br />  &quot;Hey, Max.  Wanna drink?&quot; asked Jack.
<br />
<br />  &quot;No, I'm good,&quot; he replied.  He seemed distracted.
<br />
<br />  &quot;You OK?&quot;
<br />
<br />  Jack knew that something was wrong, but not what it was.  Max usually had a drink.  But it couldn't be that bad.  His life was mainly full of ups.
<br />
<br />  &quot;They grounded it.  They grounded my ship!  Just because its middle fin was missing.  It'll take a day to repair.  A day!  What will the boss say?&quot; Max replied, finally.
<br />
<br />  &quot;The boss'll understand.  Don't worry.  Here, have some credits.  There's plenty to do here.&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;That's not the point!  I was so close.  So close!&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;Close to what?&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;The Flint!  If I bring it in, I'm sure to get a promotion.&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;What happened?&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;Rogue asteroid.  Huge.  Lucky it only clipped me.&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;Tell ya what, buddy.  Come along in my dagger: it'll be ready in a few minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;OK, sure.  But I want 50% of the profit.&quot;
<br />
<br />  &quot;Sure!  You crack me up, Max.  Of course you'll get half.&quot;
<br />
<br />  They'd done a good job: his dagger was gleaming and its twin Drails and Javelin launcher were as good as new.  Launching, he felt excited.  The Flint had been lost 2 months ago.  The journey was uneventful as the navigational computer took care of everything.  As they neared the wreck, Max cried 'There it is!' and he headed for it.  Radiation was eating away at his hull, but they would be out soon.  He aimed the Drails at the wreck, but found that he had a new target: two Liberty defenders.  He gasped as he turned to flee and began to power up his cruise engines.  He was about to run.  The hornet came as a surprise, hitting him squarely in the tail: he had to fight.

<br />Lance: OK people. We're just a trade lane away from the Cali jump gate.
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-2: So boss, how much are we getting for this?
<br />
<br />Lance: A lot. A lump sum for siding with Liberty plus a generous sum for each assignment.
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-3: I'm still not sure about this. I mean we're bounty hunters, not soldiers.
<br />
<br />Lance: And whats the difference between fighting a bunch of pirates and a wing of military vessels?
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-3:.........
<br />
<br />Lance: Exactly....OK. We're at the jump gate. 
<br />
<br />Battleship Unity: This is Battleship unity to Bounty Hunter wing. Please identify yourself.
<br />
<br />Lance: This is Bounty Hunters Ioda 1-1. We've been hired by the LPI to help defend California.
<br />
<br />BU: Copy that Bounty Hunters Ioda 1-1. You have priority clearance.
<br />
<br />Lance:Nice....

<br />The 5 members of the Ioda wing fly past the freighters carrying ammo and supplies and enter the jump gate into the California system

<br />He jumped out of the trade lane at the last second to get 4-5 seconds lead he needed, britonian reinforcements were comeing, and they didnt like a liberty defender snooping around the place. &quot;looks like liberty's gonna lose&quot; he thought outloud, losing the britonian ships. Now, if he could get back to corsair space... he knew of a hump hole way up in the system, but it was rarely phase aligned. he scanned it, it was phased aligned, but, wait... it takes to TAU?!?! &quot;that cant be right&quot; as if on cue, it started to get activated, he spun around and crused to freeport 4, he noticed on his HUD, the chest icon, he clicked it and tractored something in, he would check when he landed...
<br /> on freeport 4 he looked at a bounty hunter &quot;hey, heard anything?&quot; he said &quot;card&quot; keith passed it out to her &quot;ooh, you lucky sonnava***** if the navy wasent protecting you, id cut your ****ing head off&quot; &quot;what do you mean?&quot; &quot;GET OUT NOW!!!&quot; now everyone was looking at him as he walked out... he went back to his ship, he forgot to check the cargo hold, he oxygenized it and all there was were food rations everywhre oops he thought, forgot to close the container, he cleaned up and noticed what he had earlier tractored in. it was an escape pod, he took it to the living room (his ship was renovated, and had 3 rooms, cargo, living and cockpit) and opened it, he looked like a criminal, kinda like a corsair he was still unconsious, he took his wallet and checked the card. it said &quot;enrico-Junker -B- -R-&quot; he pressed the B it now said &quot;Enrico-Junker Balence 459&quot; what to do with him he thought... he took the card and left a note &quot;gone to the bar, i hope you dont mind me borrowing&quot; he locked the cockpit so he couldnt steal the ship and left.</div>

<br />i readed a note someone left behind, and lefted a few minits later the escape pod... i looked to what is left off my ship, it is strange to know that this was before a dagger... first i need to find out where i am and what was happends before... but well... at the bar are the most rumors, so here i go...
<br />
<br />but, where is the bar... i don't know... i walked a little and asked to some where the bar is... after a few minits i walked into the bar... someone in the bar waved to me, so i walked to him and asked where we are and what happends...

<br />The Rogues quickly got out as the leader muttered somthing about how appearances can be deceiving. &quot; Well,&quot; Kiron thought, &quot; I have a rogue escape pod in the hold, better take him to Freeport 4 frist.&quot; So Kiron U-turned and headed back to freeport 4.
<br />After letting the rogue out, the rogue was thankful he had been brought to freeport 4, and not a police base as other junkers might have decided, he even promised that hell let the rest of the rogues know about this and promised never to pirate him again.
<br />Kiron went to th ebar to get a glass, he was pretty tired, so he will have to think of other jumphole routes into Liberty</div>
