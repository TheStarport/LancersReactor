			<h3><a href="#p358769" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Tanya supported Rob on her shoulder as she limped towards the hangar, checking behind her shoulder for the pursuing blue-haired bounty hunter. Rob was quickly fading from consciousness, and she needed to get to their falcon immediately.
<br />
<br />Suddenly, as she was entering the door of the hangar, a jet-black Sabre cruised expertly into the landing pad before her feet. The gilded, gleaming words <i>Ocean Soul </i>, followed by a series of intricately welded symbols, could be seen on its sleek black body. Tanya frowned. Where had she seen it before...?
<br />
<br />Her heart jumped as a man vaulted forward from it, long hair flying behind him, black ink scarring his skin. Tanya saw the bulge in his jacket almost immediately, and ran without a second thought behind a Kusarian statue, her heart pounding at the second assassination attempt in as many minutes. The blue bolts flying from his rifle punctured holes in the statue between Tanya and her attacker. She lay Rob down on the ground, safe from harm (she hoped), and pulled out her own laser.
<br />
<br />Smoothly somersaulting out from behind the column, she readied her weapon and shot five blasts violently at the dark haired man attacking her, running forward to  confront her attacker.
<br />
<br />________________
<br />
<br />Damien had seen the woman run into the hangar as he piloted his cruising ship down onto the landing pad. With no thought but the laughing, cruel face of Mason in his mind he put into practice 10 years of Hessian training and vaulted out of his ship, firing blasts towards her. 
<br />
<br />Now the woman--Tanya--moved quickly closer to him, kicking the gun out of his hands and twisting her foot until it landed directly in his chest. Damien flew backwards, crashing into Ocean Soul. He instantly leaped up again and grabbed her fist incoming towards his face, twisting it around in an armlock and forcing her towards the ground. Damien grabbed the rifle on the ground, holding it to her head. The job should be done quickly...and he would see Nikolai again.
<br />
<br />But she twisted out of his hold, and still holding her laser turned her face towards his. It was so beautiful, he had never realized it. ...It had something of Nikolai in it...
<br />
<br />His face came into Damien's mind, and he stopped, falling back. The woman stood up, pointing her laser still down at him. He rose to his knees. Cast the gun away. Fell forward. Damien's eyes filled with tears. <i>Nikolai...Nikolai... </i> 
<br />_______________________________________
<br />
<br />Tanya stood over him, her foot on his back. She didn't understand. He was conscious, surely, and still in fighting shape. And yet... he lay there on the floor, sobbing, his hand clutched around a small metal serpent. Muttering, even...her ears pricked up. She had heard him say the word &quot;Mason.&quot; Setting the power level on her firearm to &quot;stun&quot;, she fired one shot into his back and dragged the unconscious man into the hold of her falcon, pulling out a first aid kit and running back to attend on Rob.
<br />______________________________________
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;He looks Slavic, or Rhinelander. I think I saw him once, when I was working on the Hawaii. His face wasn't easily forgettable,&quot; Tanya said into her intercom.
<br />
<br />&quot;A Hessian, probably. I don't like them too much. But they're damn good fighters...maybe this guy could be some use.&quot;
<br />
<br />They were back in their ships and soaring away from the base, Rob sufficiently patched up. Tanya was shaken after the fight, and mystified at the man's behaviour...but maybe there would be an answer when he awoke.

			<div class="content">OOC: i moved my post so that it follows the proper time line, considering that Dev wakes up 2-3 hours after Rob and tanya escape
<br />
<br />Dev winced and grabbed his arm. He looked around, everyone was frozen staring at him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Dont all help at once!&quot; He yelled &quot;bloody hell...&quot;
<br />
<br />Using his other arm he grabbed a ciggerete and light it, placing it in his mouth and taking a puff. He stumbled out the door, rather annoyed. He dragged himself down the halls smoke wafting from his wound.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice girl...&quot; He thought &quot;Too bad the bloke with her was some old bugger... Well i can contact a few people....&quot;
<br />
<br />Dev stumbled over to his ship, were he managed to climb up and in. He grabbed a bandage from a First-aid kit on the side and wrapped it around his arm. Then he punched in a number on the NN.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hello?&quot; Said a womans voice at the other end.
<br />
<br />&quot;Heya, Its Dev&quot; He said, puffing on his ciggerette.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Bro, long time no see. Thanks for the Cash by the way&quot; The Woman replied
<br />
<br />&quot;No prob sis, I do need you to pull a favor for me.&quot; Dev said slowly
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh?&quot; She asked &quot;Whats that, punk&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Weeeel&quot; Dev said with a sigh &quot;You know people, i am going to send a picture of a punk and his buddy who happened to shoot the sh*t outa my arm. I need to know
<br />where they are and where there going...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If they shot you how did you get pics&quot; She asked
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn sis... i got in a few picture before i confronted them, just incase....&quot; Dev said, his sister unable to see his smirk.&quot;Well ive sent the info, i gotta launch now... Maybe i can catch up to them... i think i was out for a hour or so though....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Seeya bro&quot; She said &quot;Keep safe.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hah... yeah&quot; Dev said
<br />
<br />He pulled his ship out of the hangar. then as he sat in space he mumbled &quot;Rob, your blood is mine old timer....&quot;
<br />*         *           *                 *            *
<br />Several hours later Devs ship flew towards Freeport 1. He had been born and raised upon the station. There resided his sister, the only living family member he knew.
<br />
<br />Dev landed on the station, his ship gently floating to the ground. He started to walk down the hall ways, many people passed him. He strode towards a elevator and entered it. Another man stood next to him, glancing at Dev's head.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice hair...&quot; The man mumbled
<br />
<br />Dev grinned &quot;I like your comb-over&quot; He replied with a snicker as he left the elevator. He walked to a massive door and punched in a code. The door opened and the inside of one of the stations massive bio-domes.
<br />
<br />Dev stood there looking at the lush hills and small farms so falsely created. He strode down a path, looking at a faked wind gently brush the tree's. The bio-dome was set to night, so night he saw. Faked stars gleamed above him, if not for a distant wall one could truley believe this was a planet.
<br />
<br />Dev aproached a small patch of dirt in the grass. It was in the middle of no-were. the closest house 400 meters away. 
<br />Dev bent over and dug around a bit in the dirt. He pulled up a long but thin box. within it he removed a sword. He smiled, it was his fencing sword, he hadnt used it in 3 years, when he was 18 and was leaving home for good.
<br />
<br />Dev stood in the dirt and slowly started to pratice moves. The sword gleamed in the artifcal star light as it moved up and down. He swung the blade to his side, he heard a clang as it hit another peice of metal. 
<br />Suprised he turned to see his sister standing there grinning, her fencing sword against his.
<br />
<br />&quot;Am i that noisy?&quot; Dev asked Grinning
<br />
<br />&quot;No..&quot; His sister replied &quot;Just predictable to me, you havent changed much in three years.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Neither have you...&quot; Dev said with a sigh &quot;Same farm same place... sis you should come with me, there is a whole world.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And watch you take it from someone&quot; She asked
<br />
<br />Dev swung his blade up, then downwards at her. She caught it on her blade, pushing him back in a thrust.
<br />
<br />&quot;Theres good money and good times beyond the door...&quot; Dev said as he jumped up, pointing his sword at her head.
<br />
<br />&quot;Maybe so....&quot; She mumbled &quot;But there is also hardhsip death and pain&quot;
<br />She pushed his sowrd aside and brought it down towards the side of his neck.
<br />
<br />Dev ducked and smiled. &quot;Kept stubborn eh?&quot; He said laughing &quot;Well enough of that, you have my info?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Indeed i do...&quot; She said smiling
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Oh right summery:
<br /><b>Dev meets up with his sis, who clearly has the info he wants. The chapter gives a insight into Dev's character and possibly weakness[b/

			<div class="content">Tanya had set Rob's ship to follow her own in formation, once they left Gas Miner Naha.
<br />
<br />She sighed as the huge metallic form of the permanently-stationed hydrogen gas collector receded into the distance, as their Falcon's sped away at cruise speed.
<br />
<br />Rob's fully helmeted image appeared in the top left of her HUD and she noted how the freelancer's head seemed to be bobbing up and down slightly in a drowsy fashion.
<br />
<br />&quot;Guess we made it,&quot; he managed to whisper, somewhat weakly than before.
<br />
<br />Tanya knew the shot wasn't fatal and had stemmed the flow of blood using a 'slap-patch'. Minor surgery was needed to remove the bullet, but from her initial diagnosis that's something she could accomplish on her own. Nothing some stiches, alcohol and a burning hot blade wouldn't fix.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. We did,&quot; said Tanya still concentrating on staying aware. That young bounty hunter named Dev seemed excitable, but was harmless enough. She understood Rob's reasoning behind his actions, Dev would be too keen to get involved in their business and possibly, become more trouble than necessary. Still, she wondered if Rob's actions created another enemy she didn't need.
<br />
<br />Of more concern was the Hessian currently lounging in her cargo hold. She turned on the vidcam to check how he was doing and smiled gratefully when his prone form appeared at the centre of the loading bay.
<br />
<br />&quot;Rob. We need to learn more about the man in my cargo bay,&quot; she said, frowning when she received no response after a few moments. &quot;Rob. Rob? Are you there?&quot;
<br />
<br />No image flashed up on her HUD and she began to worry. Tanya quickly punched up a navmap of the local area. She knew of a Junker base in the area and though they weren't particularly friendly towards her, they certainly weren't hostile either. Tanya swiftly changed course, checked Rob's ship was still on autopilot then hailed the station.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yanagi Depot, this is freelancer zero-dash-alpha-two, requesting landing clearance for me and my escort.&quot;
<br />
<br />The reply followed a static filled pause.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Yanagi Depot, we have you on our scanners and you're both cleared to land, freelancer. Have a nice day.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya nodded and as the station came into view, let the automatic docking sequence take over.

			<div class="content">The tractor beams of Yanagi's automated docking system guided Rob's Falcon into one of the station's docking bays. This was just as well, as Rob was in no condition to fly. The slap-patch Tanya had applied was a new experimental model, equipped with a small computer which monitored the patient's general well being and automatically adjusted the dosages of various medications as it deemed necessary. When Rob reached to break the comm connection with Tanya he strained his injured shoulder quite badly. The computer read - correctly - that Rob was in immense pain from the wound and administered rather a large dose of sedative to compensate. The drugs hit Rob like a sledgehammer and he went out like a light.
<br />
<br />OOC: I'm fresh out of ideas as to what happens now. If inspiration strikes I'll write more, but don't hold your breath.
<br />
<br />Edit: After reading Athena's post in the &quot;Guy Trouble&quot; thread I've decided she needs a hug.
<br />
<br />*hugs Athena*

			<div class="content">Dev light a Ciggerete as he looked at his sister. She stood there grinning at him as the smoke wafted up into the sky.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well?&quot; Dev asked &quot;Were the hell are they?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yanagi currently&quot; She replied &quot;By the time you could get there....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hell with it, i gotta move and take that man down&quot; Dev said dropping his ciggerete and grinding it out with his boot.
<br />
<br />&quot;You visit me for a few minutes and then you leave.... Typical you.&quot; His sister said with a sigh.
<br />
<br />&quot;Or you could come with me...&quot; Dev mumbled
<br />
<br />&quot;Naw.... but if your going to Yanagi can you deliver something to the bartender there?&quot; She asked him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Why the hell not?&quot; Dev said smiling &quot;Where do i pick it up sis&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I knew you'd say yes so its on your ship now, black suitecase&quot; she said,  then hugging him &quot;Stay safe, good luck.&quot;
<br />
<br />Dev grinned &quot;If anyone gives you hell sis, let me know.&quot;
<br />
<br />He walked down the dirt path, to the door of the bio-dome. It opened and he entered the hallway.  He walked looking at people and he thought &quot;How many of them have normal lives... how many can actualy spend time with there family&quot;
<br />
<br />Dev walked into the hangar that stored his ship. A wonderful valkyre his sister had stolen for him. Spray painted in blue on the side it said &quot;Dev&quot;
<br />
<br />He jumped in and noted next to him the suitecase. he flipped in up and tried to open it. No luck it was locked, He pulled out a pick and started to fiddle with the lock. It didnt work, he set the suitecase down and shot off.
<br />
<br />In cold space he left, in a matter of hours he would be at Yanagi, but would Rob be there?
<br />
<br />Summary: <b> More learn about Dev's character. He sets off to find Rob for some revenge, will he arrive in time at Yanagi?  </b></div>

			<div class="content">Tanya and the now-awakened Rob stepped into the cargo hold of Athena's ship, gazing at the pale young man still comatose therein. He was dressed in black silk, his shirt open at the collarbone that revealed even more ink tattooed to his skin.
<br />
<br />Rob frowned. &quot;I've never seen a Hessian so obsessed with writing images all over himself. You picked up a weird one.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya laughed quietly. &quot;He was good. Not like Hideko, but very good. And yet...&quot;
<br />
<br />Rob silenced her and drew his weapon, pointing towards the Hessian. He was stirring.  Tanya brushed past him, drawing her own weapon and clenching her fists. The man's eyes flashed open. He stared into the cold metal gun before his eyes, the fierce woman preparing to strike him, then sighed and rolled onto his back. &quot;I thought I was dead. Why must I awake again?&quot; he said, to noone in particular. &quot;You, Miss Williams, are a merciful woman. And even more beautiful than I thought.&quot; (still to the cieling of the cargo hold). He rolled over to his side again, feeling her green eyes bore into his black. His mouth creased into a smile.
<br />
<br />Rob stepped forward. &quot;Please, do not take offence. I am...how do you say...taken.  I was merely stating the truth,&quot; the man uttered. Rob nodded. &quot;Time for some explanations. Who do you work for, and why did you try to kill Tanya?&quot;
<br />
<br />A smirk passed across the man's lips. &quot;I work for that which is right, that which is wise, and the man whom I love. &quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Go on...You're a Hessian, aren't you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Please, I do not wish to be associated with the Red Hessians. I fight for the Bundschuh--and Mason sent me to kill Tanya. Please--I did it against my will, to save another...I have done wrong. That is why I stopped. Forgive me...&quot; Tears once again formed in his eyes, and pain seared across his rugged face.
<br />
<br />Tanya turned to Rob. &quot;I think we should trust him.&quot;
<br />
<br />Rob sighed. &quot;Fine. He doesn't seem like too much trouble. He may even be helpful...&quot;
<br />
<br />She turned back to the Bundschuh. &quot;What's your name?&quot;
<br />
<br />The man stood for the first time, stepped out of the cargo hold, and tied his hair back behind his head. &quot;Damien Solkovsky. I am in your service. Tanya...and...&quot;
<br />
<br />Rob extended his hand. &quot;Rob Schaefer. But my questions still aren't answered--why did Mason ask you to kill Tanya? Why did you accept?&quot;
<br />
<br />Damien looked at them both, and stepped out of the cargo hold. &quot;It would be better to talk this through over a shot of vodka--but not here. Honshu. Let me just  travel back to Naha to retrieve my ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya nodded. &quot;Agreed.&quot;
<br />
<br />_____________________
<br />
<br />In the bar of the Dragon Palace on Planet Honshu, having safely retrieved Ocean Soul, Damien told them everything--his confrontation with Mason, his own obsession with philosophy, beauty, and morality, his relationship with the young man Nikolai. He listened in turn to Tanya's story of how she came to be on the trail of Mason, her relationships with Rutger and Travis, and how she ended up wandering around with Rob--who for nearly the entire conversation had been dead silent.
<br />
<br />Damien took a deep sip of his vodka. &quot;I will fight for you as long as there is a breath left in my body, Tanya. I owe it to you.&quot;
