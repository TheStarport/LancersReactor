			<div class="content">I have a question for all good modders, why is it that nobody has made a full theme mod for Freelancer I meen its not like there isnt enough skill out there some of the mods that have been made have been very good.
<br />When I say theme I meen a mod that doesnt rely on the origonal Freelancer systems for the game but one that has completely new systems with new trade lanes and new ships.
<br />I remember seeing one a while back that was based on the star wars theme but I only ever saw one installment of that mod which was a shame as it showed promise.
<br />The thing is if it is done right it doesnt need to be many systems you could actually get away with making a 3 system mod 1 start system and 2 battle systems thats just an example.
<br />What I cant figure out is why all the descent modders seem to be making addons for Freelancer, why ?.
<br />Nearly every configuration of systems, ships and guns has been done but only as an addon to the origonal Freelancer universe which unfortunately every person who has played for more than a week knows like the back of his hand this unfortuantely gives any new mod a short lifespan.
<br />I think its time for someone or a group to release a complete theme mod one where nobody knows where anything is and one that doesnt work with datastorm as I think this would bring back the enjoyement to the game that many people have lost.</div>

			<div class="content">Hawklord - i agree, it would be good - but its also a massive undertaking basically.
<br />
<br />I definately agree about datastorm. Whilst its a useful thing for some, for mod makers it has spoilt any detail I was putting in my mod - cause when i was taking HOURS trying to make some fun puzzles and thoughts for players to do, involving new items, rumours in bars, wreck loot clues and such, this will totally be knackered by datastorm - as everyone can just find stuff to damned easy. Mind you - I will get my own back...................space is 3 dimensional - and as far as i know, they only do 2d in those things <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Something that annoys me about the mods that are made for this game is when Freelancer was first released everybody loved the way the ships handled and I have noticed that in a lot of the mods the actual modder says he is expanding on the origonal Freelancer game, unfortunately for them Exapanding seems to meen altering the way the perfectlly ballanced Freelancer ships move and unfortunately 9 times out of 10 they never get it right and for me the mod is ruined and im sure it is this way for a lot of others too.
<br />As far as datastorm is conscerned I have never used it and never intend to as I prefere to enjoy a mod to the fullest extent by finding everything on my own, saying that it is a very usefull program and all credit to the person who made it,I just wish that people would stop posting the datastorm files for a mod within minutes of the mod appearing on Lancersreactor.
<br />@ Chips, how long would it take you to create 3 systems, 1 system has 1 station a very big mine field with 2 pathways leading to 2 jumpholes to the other systems.
<br />The other 2 systems  would have 1 planet and 2 jumpholes, 1 going to the start system the other going to the oposing system.
<br />With such a small mod it should be possible to have a large amount of players on a server as the processor is only handeling information for really 2 systems with people in it. You would have 2 oposing systems both with exactly the same ships basically all out war.
<br />This is a theme mod and I dont think it would take that long to make.</div>

			<div class="content">David Hunter 4 falls into that category perfectly.
<br />We're attempting to make a Total Conversion (or as damn near close to one as possible) with FreeLancer.
<br />We're already underway with the construction of our own solar system as a FreeLancer galaxy, with planets and moons being their own separate system. This means a lot of time will be spent finding workarounds to make things visible and a long way away.
<br />We're working on scale planetoids, and making good headway. Our planet Earth will be something like 200K across, and requires tradelanes to travel around to various locations on the planet - you can visit plenty of different cities on the same planet, which should make for a difference to FreeLancer, but only slightly, it's not really a huge gameplay difference, just a nicety.
<br />The most important work is the entirely new models - all the factions are naturally being replaced from scratch, so that we'll have our own set of unique factions, each with its own different set of technologies.
<br />We're hopefully going to change gameplay a lot by using a different set of physics to those used in FreeLancer, making for a wider variety of ships and associated performances given certain scenarios.
<br />Dh4 also intends to be a lot less 'FreeLance' based, featuring structured mission scenario, and a very solid campaign tree set in a rather unique universe. You can check out the now outdated / incomplete public design documentation here; (copy and paste into browser)
