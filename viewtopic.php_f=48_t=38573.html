			<div class="content">Freelancer: Silent Death, a conversion project.
<br />
<br />This mod will be a fairly extensive conversion in the realm of a death match / clan battle mod, we request people that can:
<br />
<br />&gt; Create Ships (including modelling, hardpoints etc)
<br />&gt; Model new Bases and Weapon Platforms (including loadouts)
<br />&gt; Texture the aforementioned
<br />&gt; Integrate the aforementioned into Freelancer
<br />&gt; Manipulate factions (empathy etc)
<br />&gt; Edit and balance weaponry
<br />&gt; Design and implement systems
<br />&gt; Create FLMM scripts and packages
<br />&gt; Debug mods
<br />
<br />It would be fantastic if people with any of the aforementioned skills has the time to help us create this project!
<br />
<br />I myself am currently learning aspects of the above so obviously I will be doing bits and pieces of the work but the help is still needed as there are areas that I lack in, and working on this will serve as a great learning project for me with the guidance of those who know what they are doing.
<br />
<br />This mod will be a (almost) total conversion of a MMORPG that was killed off back in 2001 when EA ceased to run its platinum gaming service, that game was Silent Death Online, and was on a basic level very similiar to Freelancer in the respect of starting with a basic ship, earning credits and level so that you could purchase bigger and better ships, weapons, shields and engines.
<br />
<br />This will infact be on a lesser scale than Freelancer, so a lot of things are to be stripped out, AI, Systems, Bases, Ships, Weapons, Shields etc.
<br />
<br />The mod is currently in its design phase, much of the material has already been pulled off the original, so all that is required is that it be added into freelancer in the appropriate places. The data that needs to be altered to balance within  Freelancer is under construction (weapon, shield and engine statistics that will  balance the gameplay etc) so once that is complete the mod can be built up. 
<br />
<br />I will be happy to pass on any information I can from Silent Death, as I have data, sounds, and even the old ship designs to base new ones from.
<br />
<br />Additionally, a website is currently being built up, but as of yet will not be live until it is more content rich (only started it today). Hopefully it won't be too long as I am using a content management system (php-nuke platinum) which is making it easier than designing one from scratch.
<br />
<br />Also I will be arranging a private mailing group for our team (provided I get one), so that you guys may post code between yourselves easily and painlessly so you can share your ideas with the rest of the team at any time.
<br />
<br />We are also in need of a supervisor, I'd love it if that were to be you Chips as I have seen from all your previous posts you definately know a bit about everything to do with modding Freelancer. It would be phenominal to have you onboard to help the team I gather here with cleanup work, finalising the mod and debugging it so we can fix any problems and eventually release it.
<br />
<br />If you can't then thats fine mate I'm sure you have other more important projects to be working on, I just thought I'd ask <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Or if anyone else can satisfy the role I just mentioned, let me know and I'd still be glad for the help!!
<br />
<br />I know that these sort of mods have been done before, but this will be hopefully a different experience, as it won't be the same old Freelancer by the time we've done!
<br />
<br />Regards, the Silent Death Reborn crew 
<br />(which is me and one other at the moment btw lol)

			<h3><a href="#p365052" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">The trouble you will have with trying to get people to make new mods now is that everyone and their dog has an idea for what would be a 'cool' mod.  However, most of the people who know how to mod will either A) be working on Mod's of their own with their own ideas or <img src=smilies/icon_smile_blackeye.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> be working on one of the bigger mods.
<br />
<br />Simply put, if you have an idea for a mod, the best way to get it done is to start with it small and make it yourself with perhaps one or two friends if you want assistance.  Indeed, most of the mods in Lancers started this way with just one or two people working on it.  Then, as you release it and start getting it 'out there' people will start to pay more attention and those who like what you have done as a starter will be more willing to come forward and help, enabling the mod to grow and develop further.  This is a more guaranteed way of getting yourself noticed and getting people to help then posts like these where people go 'hey! I have an idea, lets do x, y and z and oh, we will need people to cover the 20 odd areas that I don't know.'  If I read something like this, I'm less likely to want to get involved then say in a mod where I have seen it has been successful and is popular and people have already put a lot of work into it or a mod based on my own ideas and story lines.
<br />
<br />Simply put, start small and build from that.  As you build and show people that you are willing to put the work in to make this the mod you want, more people will be drawn to the mod.

<br />
<br />I can take people not liking the idea, but people not responding AT ALL, is kind of rude, I mean even if its a sorry can't because I'm working on another mod, thats fine, even if they are lying and just don't want to do it lol. See my point of view?

			<div class="content">Hi pwn4ge!
<br />
<br />I think you expect too much. As Aldebaran28 has said already, most of the modders are already working on a mod and therefore do not have the time to mod. I'm also working on my own mod (The Monkeys) and I started it alone and I'm still the only one working on it. Of course I'm therefore quite slow and cannot include everything (e.g.: I have to get models of others, as I'm only good at ini-coding and cannot model any new ships or stations). But on the other hand I can make the mod totally in the way I want it and do not have to be in time or something like this, as the whole mod is finished when I'm finished. So, there aren't only bad things in creating a mod without a team. At least at the beginning this is really good, as you need to learn everything and cannot just learn one thing like system building without knowing anything about implementing new ships into the mod. I learned almost everything about ini coding and can do most of the things I want to have in my mod now. Sometimes I'm even able to add totally new ideas of my own and this is only, because I started all of this alone.
<br />
<br />For your last post: Of course it would be nice if someone like me would just post something like: &quot;I really like your ideas and hope you will find some team members. Unfortunately I'm already working on a mod and therefore cannot help you. Good luck anyway!&quot;
<br />Of course this would be nice, but I once did this and the guy asking for help just posted back.
<br />Thanks, but please do not post if you cannot really help with the mod. Therefore I do not post things like that anymore. Only sometimes, if there is a new unique mod idea (like Warriors of the Sky) I post this just to show, that I really like ones ideas. And of course the mod makers are quite busy normally and most times do not even have enough time to work on their own projects. Therefore they just answer the questions in the General editing forum, as they can do this quite fast and can also really help others with this and not just tell them that they like their ideas.
<br />
<br />I hope you may understand now, why it is so hard to find someone, who can help you. I also got a thread here in the forum and I would not have found someone, if I did not help someone else some time ago, who is now helping me.
<br />
<br />Good luck anyway and just try to start. Maybe you will find someone soon, or after you released a first version of your mod (It does not have to be so large and perfect)!!!

			<div class="content">The mod you complained about was the CYOF mod idea. At the height of its power there were about 20 of us playing the CYOF game (they;re up to number 5 now, although i gave up) (invented by me and DSQrn) so of course there would be a lot of interest.</div>

			<div class="content">you know, there nothing wrong with posting your ideas and asking if people would be interested in the idea of the mod. That way you can see what kinda interest there is, and the modder who can help can see that there is interest and might be more inclined to offer there talents. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_cool.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
