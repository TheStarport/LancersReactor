<br />
<br />&quot;Crap&quot;
<br />
<br />Several heads turned as Michael kicked his Falcon, after wich a Vassago fell off.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh f*ck it.&quot; he silently cursed, as he sat down with his back agianst the Nova Sailor .
<br />
<br />His Neuralnet was busted and without it he couldn't even get his engines started.
<br />
<br />A mechanic noticed him sitting and walked up to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;What's yer problem their mate?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;My neuralnet is busted.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Badly?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nah, just the main processor and the communit, that's all.&quot; Michael said sarcasticaly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I'll go off and see what we've got. I'll be right back.&quot; and before Michael could respond, the mechanic walked away.
<br />
<br />Lutz turned around the nose of the Falcon and sat with Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tough day Michael?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;hmm.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Still comming along?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course I am. I just need to fix my neuralnet, that's all.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ouch, that's serious.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;yeah. Well, this mechanic is off looking for something.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sure he finds something.&quot; Lutz tried to cheer him up.
<br />
<br />at that moment the mechanic returned with a big smile.
<br />
<br />&quot;I think I have something for you in dock six. The ship is totally busted, but the neuralnet seems to be mostly intact.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's great!&quot; said Michael, as he got up and ran of to dock six. Lutz followed.
<br />
<br />Walkers voice came over the comms.
<br />
<br />&quot;Last call everybody. If you want to come along, the last transport for the Arizona  is leaving now. As soon as it's unloaded we're outta here. That'll be... about fifteen minutes. Walker out.&quot;
<br />
<br />A couple of guys came ranning out of dock three and headed straight for the transport. Lutz looked at Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;Last chance, Michael.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you mad?! No way I'm gonna let you do this alone.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I knew that,&quot; said Lutz, &quot;do you need any help with that?&quot;
<br />
<br />They had found a battered Defender. Well, what was left of it anyway. It missed both it's side fins and the spoiler. The engine looked much like one of the cruisers outside and it had holes in it's hull in several places.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's a wonder this thing didn't blow up.&quot; said Lutz, &quot;How's the neuralnet?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, that mech was right. It has everything I need, but that's it alright.&quot; Michael pulled out the parts of the neuralnet he needed and turned to Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;Apart from the main processor and the communit, everything is busted.&quot;
<br />
<br />They walked back to the Nova Sailor  wich, from a distance didn't look all that different from that Defender in dock six.
<br />
<br />&quot;Man,&quot; said Lutz, who barely could contain his laughter as the missilelauncher broke off of the Falcon, &quot;we'd better hurry. Looks like we have some work here.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael grumbled something and went to work.
<br />
<br />after ten minutes Lutz' personnal communit started bleeping.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, Johnson here. We're about to leave, are you guys coming or what?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sorry Johnson, we have other plans.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What? what do you mean?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I've got some business to attend to at Manhattan. We'll find you in Brettonia.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;WHAT! Lutz, you are crazy. Going to Manhattan is suicide. You have to come with us.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No can't do Johnson. There's someone I gotta pick up. But don't worry, I have Michael here with me.&quot;
<br />
<br />Johnson was probably too baffled, because it took him quite a while to respond.
<br />
<br />&quot;You do realize we can't come back for you if anything goes wrong, don't you?
<br />
<br />&quot;We'll be al right. You go and get everybody outta there, ok?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok... Take care you two and get back in one piece.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We will. Lutz out.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz closed the communit and realized there was no turning back.
<br />
<br />Fifteen minutes later Michael tried the power switch ones again. Much to Lutz' uncomfort, who had taken cover behind some abandonned crates as he expected the whole thing to explode.
<br />
<br />After a first low gurgling sound, the engine slowly came to life and after a few seconds the engine was humming comfortably and Lutz came out from behind the crates.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, that's taken care of.&quot; said Michael, &quot;Now, lets refuel and get the hell out of here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;My thoughts exactly.&quot; Said Lutz and a few minutes later they both were ready for departure.
<br />
<br />The docking bay doors were set to automatic, so that anyone who radioed in, could dock and undock without a docking controler.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Outside it was silent.
<br />
<br />Space was allways silent, but on the comms you could usually hear the regular chatter of company vessals or sometimes the disciplinned hails of the Police or the Navy ennouncing a cargoscan.
<br />
<br />But space was silent.
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />Michael and Lutz flew outside LPI Sugarland.
<br />
<br />The Arizona was probably already in California by now. Leaving them behind was dificult. Both Michael and Lutz felt they should be there, protecting the Battleship, together with their friend Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />Lutz had hessitated to take Arrigoni along, but dicided not to. In his Stiletto, he was one of the heavier outfitted fighters and would provide a lot off support to the escort. He was to slow and not agile enough to come along with them to Manhattan. If they would get into a hassle and he would be surprised if the wouldn't, they needed to get out quick. A falcon and a Defender-XS were perfect for the job, a stiletto would be to slow.
<br />
<br />Alys would hardly fit in the back of the defender, but Lutz had reserved a spot for her ever since he fled from Liberty.
<br />
<br />Lutz looked at the picture he had kept in his pocket. All the sweating and fighting had made the picture look like it was a hundred years old, but he could still see her beauty. Although he didn't realy need a picture to remember what she looked like. He merely needed to close his eyes and he could see her smiling face, bright and sunlit as though he saw her just yesterday.
<br />
<br />He whiped a tear from his eye and hailed Michael over the secure channel.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, how much farther to the Jumphole?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;About 30k Lutz. Are you ok mate, you sound a little down.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz smiled faintly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I'm alright. I just want to get to Alys as soon as possible. This is probably the last chance I got.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't worry Lutz, we're gettin' there. And we're gettin' out again too. You'll have my word on it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah...&quot; It was all Lutz could say.
<br />
<br />Michael couldn't help but feal great sympathy for his friend. Altough he didn't know how Lutz felt at the moment. 
<br />How could he; he'd been single most of his life. Sure, he'd been in love. A few times actually. But it was never sirious enough and he'd been happy on his own. 
<br />Still, he realised he missed the warmth and comfort of a soulmate, someone he could share his deepest thoughts with.
<br />
<br />As he thought about all this, he saw the jumphole coming up and readied him for the hell they would be plunged into the minute they came out on the other side.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, are you ready for this.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;As ready as i've never been before Michael, lead me in buddy.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael took the jump and quietly wished he was born in a different lifetime...

			<h3><a href="#p205937" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">What the hell were Michael and Lutz doing not on the <i>Arizona </i>? Johnson wondered. But he stopped wondering because the ship began to move. A battleship converting to cruise speed was interesting, to say the least. First, a low rumble spread throughout the ship due to the cruise engines powering up. Then, it stopped for a second, and then the ship began accelerating.
<br />
<br />Johnson figured he had spent too much time in the bar already, so he exited, and walked around the ship. If he himself had a functional ship, he would be one of the few people outside escorting. The goal was to get through space as fast as possible with as many people alive, not to fight off every single Liberty ship that comes along.
<br />
<br />Arrigoni was one of the ones escorting. Johnson hoped to high heaven that he lived. He was glad that there was a direct comm link between Johnson and Arrigoni's ship. He'd get to know information about what was going on outside.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, Arrigoni.&quot; Johnson spoke into his comm unit.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah?&quot; Arrigoni buzzed back.
<br />
<br />&quot;How ya holding up?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Were coming up on the jumphloe now. Nothing's happened so far, but that could soon change.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Keep me posted, will ya?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Will do.&quot; Arrigoni responded. Johnson wasn't too hopeful about Arrigoni's survival though.
<br />
<br />Johnson walked down to the docking bay. Along the way, he overheard a person responding to his comm unit.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're keeping the turrets on standby, so get down to your post.&quot; the unit buzzed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Aye, aye.&quot; the crewman responded.
<br />
<br />FIghter escorts were on a shift basis. When one got too damaged, it would come back, and another one would go out in his place.
<br />
<br />He felt a sudden shift as the battleship entered the jumphole. It was dangerous for a fighter to go through a jumphole, much, much less a battleship.
<br />
<br />The sudden shift turned to the opposite direction as the battleship exited the jumphole.
<br />
<br />&quot;We are now in California!&quot; the person controlling the intercom said. Cheers could be heard throughout the ship.
<br />
<br />Johnson wanted a place to look out the window. So he walked till he found one. There was one conveniently located in the bar.
<br />
<br />&quot;How ya holding up there, Arrigoni?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm fine, but we're bound to meet trouble soon.&quot; Arrigoni responded
<br />
<br />Johnson looked out the window and saw two battleships and several cruisers, with uncountable fighters. &quot;No kidding.&quot; Johnson said. Were gonna have to make one helluva escape, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />Once again, the battleship burst into cruise speed, headed for the Cortez jumphole. But it looked like the battleship was going to take a little detour....
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, Arrigoni, what's going on?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Something about going through the tradelanes--&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Johnson asked. &quot;We don't even know if the battleship will fit?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's kind of the idea. Destroy the tradelanes, speed our escape, prevent the Liberty Navy from getting us....&quot; Arrigoni responded.
<br />
<br />Now that Arrigoni explained it, it made more sense. &quot;It's still crazy.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I won't disagree.&quot; Arrigoni said.
<br />
<br />A few minutes later, the battleship entered the tradelane. Johnson didn't know how it was working, but he knew it was, as every loud thud each second or so testified. Then it dropped out of the tradelane, and turned towards the jumphole.

			<div class="content">The hurdling jumphole dropped them in one of the creapiest places of Sirius and Michael automatically thought back at his time with the Police force when he was assigned to one of the worst patrols Liberty had to offer; the Badlands. And bad it was.
<br />
<br />The Badlands consisted mostly of a dark nebula-like cloud in wich visability was poor. The only times you could see clearly was during the violent electrical storms that run though the cloud. In the middle of all that, huge stone monoliths hovered mysteriously inside the cloud and made you believe you were in a completely different dimension.
<br />Added to that Buffalo base and a few radiation zones and you had yourself the equivalent of hell.
<br />
<br />It was usually concidered an honour to be send to the Badlands, as they only asked the very best. But Michael thought it was a doubtful one, because it was mostly a oneway trip. A lot of people got killed on their first patrol. When Michael was asked to go to West Point, from where the Badland patrols began, he hessitated at first, but his ego answered before he had a chance to think. That would be the choice wich decided the rest of his life.
<br />
<br />*Flashback*
<br />
<br />He miraculously survived his first patrol. But after a few patrols he grew out to be one of the best fighters, perfecting his skill in dogfighting in astroidfields.
<br />He soon was assigned his own fighterwing and after a year he was asked to lead trainees into the badlands for their Last Cruisade. (OOC: I know Jedi named it Last Cruise, but I think this sounds better. If you want me to change it back Jedi, just let me know <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />After he lost a complete wing of graduates he gave up on the job and went back to commanding a wing of more experienced fighters. He flew a couple of patrols with Lutz before he was asked to join the secret weapons program.
<br />
<br />Soon after that on a certain patrol, Michael and his wing were ambushed by a dozen Outcasts who apearently had a score to settle with one of his flyingbuddies, Gerald Anderson. They had to break and make a run for it, but Gerald never stood a chance as the twelve daggers hit him from all sides.
<br />
<br />A couple of hours later, Michael and the remains of his wing left West Point and went back into the Badlands to avenge Gerald. They had been drinking and were in no condition to fly, let alone fight. They went straight for Buffalo and were slain by hordes of Rogues, Hackers and Outcasts. Michael was the only one who made it back alive.
<br />
<br />He was courtmarshalled and scentenced to ten years of hard labour on California Minor. Michael managed to escape after two months, stealing a Falcon and killing a guard and a Police wing on the way to Kepler, where the Hackers took him in at Athlon Base. Fealing restless, Michael decided to fly around and left Athlon.
<br />
<br />He went from Kusari, to Rheinland, to Brettonia. Never staying longer than a few weeks at one place, until he arrived at Mactan, where he met Frederick May. The two became sort of friends and Michael soon felt at home. He gained the respect of the Hackers by being the first to succesfully ecsort 25 tradeconvoys through the Omega systems.
<br />
<br />All went well and Michael felt comfortable and content, now that he had found his place. Until one day, when he entered Liberty space for the first time in years.
<br />
<br />He just picked up a full load of gold in Dublin and wanted to take a shortcut through Liberty. He figured they forgot about him after all those years and took the jumpgate to California. But they hadn't forgotten him and he was immidiately targeted by a pair of bounty hunters. He managed to shake them off by entering the tradelane to Cal. Minor, but the Bounty Hunters had a large network and they had already made contact, so that when he left the tradelane, he was awaited by a full wing of Bounty Hunters.
<br />
<br />He was able to take most of them down, when all of a sudden back up arrived and Michael had to escape. He used the jumphole to New York, but his persuers knew the jumpholes too and were ready for him at the other side.
<br />
<br />They chased him all the way to Colorado, disabeling his cruise engines along the way. In Colorado, the Xeno's held back most of the Bounty Hunters, wich enabled Michael to make a run for the Kepler jumpgate, but the Hunters were blocking the gate.
<br />
<br />He had no other choice than to escape to the New Harlem system where the Hunters were less in number.
<br />
<br />In New Harlem he shook of the rest of the Hunters, killing three and chasing away the remaining two. But not before they fired a javelin missile, wich disabled his scanner.
<br />
<br />He landed on New Harlem, expecting to get repairs, maybe a drink, get the hell out of there and go to Athlon Base in Kepler. But things didn't exactly go as planned.
<br />
<br />*end Flashback*
<br />
<br />And now he was back in New York. Back in the Badlands and heading straight for West Point, his old home. How long has it been since he left? Three, four years? He couldn't remember. It felt like a lifetime.
<br />
<br />He was surprised not to see Liberty Navy or Police here. They must concentrate their forces on the independent systems and with the threat of Buffalo gone, Michael didn't have to check his scanner to know that Buffalo was distroyed, Liberty didn't bother about the BAdlands anymore. 
<br />
<br />Typical Liberty arrogance. When he was still a police officer he admired that about Liberty, but being a Hacker had thought him to see it as a flaw and to use it against them. And now, after all those ruthless attacks on criminal bases, he hated it.
<br />
<br />Lutz' voice took his mind of the past and brought him back to reality.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, how's your scanner?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Clean, but that's mostly because of the interfearence here. When we leave the Badlands, I'm sure we will pick up more.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I was afraid of that.&quot;
<br />
<br />Both were quite, as they both had no idea on how to handle this situation.
<br />
<br />Come to think of it, it was impossible to get to Manhattan undetected and even if they made it that far, how would they land? Sure thing the dockingring control wouldn't let them land with half the navy on their tail.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you have a plan Lutz?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I heard West Point was distroyed. Hopefully the didn't bother to replace it with a battleship, so we can take the tradelane to Manhattan and land before they spot us.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we'll soon find out, because we're about to leave the Badlands.&quot; Michael anounced.</div>

<br /><i>Sorry for me sudden leaving from the ship. I had to help somebody out, but that is almost done. Also take care of Helen, I don't want to lose her again. Anyway as I was on me way to Manhatten I found some nice Rheinland technolocy, you can't belive what those eggheads (no offence) have made. I don't have time to tell more right now, but I will say that when you see their fighters a battleship is not far behinde. And if they drop a beacon, do NOT shoot it or don't let them shoot it. I also have to find out what message Logan sent to that Battleship captain. You got anything you want me to tell him? Ok ok enough chatter, I think some guards are coming. The place is crawling with Rheinladers also, wonder what they want... That remindes me - Liberty space is filled with Rheinladers and after that atmosphere burn everyone is after me. You could check the news here to see whats happening. If you can go to Kursari or Bretonia space, I think Matt has everything under control there. Nobody in here has heard anything about Kursari, wach out. </i>
<br />
<br />O'Connor out.

O'Connor looked at him a minute or so and then started talking: &quot;Well if you must know then a independent army will crush your unfair rule here and return to pirating, then this whole place blows up and some guy called terranova is going to kill everything.&quot; Both officers jaw fell down. &quot;Thats the most idiotic story I have ever heard, do you think that I'm a fool, or have you just dropped out from the sky?&quot; and The fat man turned around to leave. Dieter looked at O'Connor with discust in his eyes and said &quot;We will continiue this tomorrow Mr.O'Connor, meanwhile think about those in Sigma 19. Because after the Battleship we sent there will be through with them there ins't much things to think about.&quot;

<br />she had discovered a fully stocked deep storage room filled with an asortment of advanced fighters from every house. there was even a few she didn't recognize. there were advanced patriots, defender-XSs, Dragons. Advanced dragons, Bretonian very heavy fighters, several advanced valkeries, even a corsair m-15 and a outcast sabre-2000. the only problem was that they were in lockdown and couldn't be accessed. only one fighter had it's canopy open. it was a sleak, powerful light fighter of kusari design. over it's back was a scorpian-like tail with a large cannon. it also had 2 skyblast Cs and 2 suzuki adv. missle tubes mounted. it was like she had just fallen in love.

			<div class="content">Ever since Roger joined with the Pirate fleet, he felt that something in this whole conflict was wrong. Now as he heard about the Battleship going to Sigma 19 he realized that everybody he trusted were there and he cannot afford to lose them, not again. He cursed the message he sent because that was the only way they could have traced the Malaga base. Roger thought it was about time to get out and see what prisoners are here besides him. After breaking out from the cell using an energy shield and small explosive charge, Roger went to comm unit and clicked some buttons. 
<br />
<br />*All lockdown brig doors open*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: See, that wasn't so hard... If it only would be so easy when fighting a pack of Sabers.
<br />Dieter: Ahha, you are already out?
<br />O'Connor: Yeh, how long would it then take? Good act by the way.
<br />Dieter: Oh? I thought so myself I brought you your guns. And Sinclair wanted me to give you this. 
<br />
<br />*He gives a envelope to Roger*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Do this, do that. I bet that this is another order from him. He should do some work himself.
<br />Dieter: Well, actually he is here.
<br />O'Connor: He is? What for?
<br />Dieter: Logan&#8217;s funeral. Nice shot.
<br />O'Connor: Hey, that&#8217;s nothing with a 16x thermal scope.
<br />Dieter: Whatever..
<br />
<br />*Both of them walk away in different directions*
<br />
<br />Now to find some ship for me. He heard some distant battle noise and started walking that way. It was a long walk and Roger used the time to calculate what was going on. Just as he was thinking about the escape plan he had Roger found a broken starflier. &quot;This will do perfect&quot; he thought when stepping inside the ships cockpit. Now he had speed and some agility. O'Connor flew straight over the battle and started shooting Rheinlanders. It was a resistance holdout that Rheinlanders were attacking. The first thing Roger wanted to do was to kill some tanks, but somebody had locked him on with a ground-to-air homing missile. Roger calmly watched the missile get close and closer with every second. Just as the missle was about to hit the starflier Roger turned it 45*. Rocket cut through the engines, but didn't explode. He heard some Rheinlander yelling that he got the escaped prisoner. And then it was all about timing. As starflier was falling Roger bailed out and luckily landed in some building under construction. His starflier crashed on top of one Rhineland main battle tank. &#8220;This is deffenetly not my day, but at least they think I&#8217;m dead and that gives me some time.&#8221; Roger activated a homing sensor and looked up his ship. This time he reached his Anubis relatively ok. The ship was all black and cut through with shrapnel. Roger felt a little sorry about the ship and tested if it can get off the ground. It could but not for long. Only weapon on the ship working was the gatling gun and that was no use in space. He looked his ships busted console and he saw a extensive damage report:

<br />&#8220;Wow, I doubt I get far with this ship.&#8221; he thought, but as he considered that lives are at stake he had to take whatever he got. A watch on Rogers hand started beeping. &#8220;Darn, I&#8217;m already late!&#8221;

			<div class="content">(OOC: well, this is part two of the rescue. It's all I could do im two hours. More coming up shortly, and be ready for a nice surprise <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />Michael and Lutz took the tradelane to Manhattan. West Point was destroyed and for their luck it wasn't replaced with a battleship.
<br />
<br />There was a Cruiser outside Manhattan and a few patroling Liberty Defenders. One of them targeted the two and announced a scan. Their Bounty Hunter status let them through, but with the warning they had to leave the system within two hours.
<br />
<br />They avoided the giagantic Hampton Landingpad wich was the most commonly used landing site for pilots, mostly merchants passing by.
<br />It was also the most crowded place of Manhattan and since the faces of both Lutz and Michael had been on the news recently, they figgured it was best to land at a more remote site.
<br />
<br />They reached an altitude of 500 metres Lutz took the lead. He opened a secure channel.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're flying to the dark side of Manhattan, to a place called Broadway.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I remember that place. Is that where you lived?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I hope Alys didn't move somewhere else, or we might have a hard time finding her.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael hadn't been to Manhattan for a realy long time. His last visit was when he had to inform a mother that his son had been killed in the Last Cruise. That had been tough.
<br />
<br />He had hoped to come back one day, but not to do some crazy suicide escape manouvre. So far they had been very lucky. Michae had been able to restore his Bounty Hunter Identity and the Liberty patrol had let them through, but they we're being monitorred now. Getting in had been easy... Getting out was going to be a lot more dificult.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're here Michael.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz landed his Defender at a nice and small landing site and Michael followed him down.
<br />
<br />A young, tall and skinny looking guy came walking up to them. He pushed his glasses back with one finger and observed the pilotes.
<br />The guy, obviously a teenager trying to make some money then peaked over their shoulders, looking at the Defender and the Falcon.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hi.&quot; he said with a terrible nasal sound. &quot;How can I help you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Can you take care of our ships while we're gone?&quot; Lutz asked, &quot;we need it filled up. We'll be back in no longer than an hour.&quot;
<br />
<br />The guy looked ove rtheir shoulders once again and turned to Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;That'll cost you $1000 a ship an hour plus the costs of the bats, bots and fuel and eventually repaircosts.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What?!&quot; said Michael. &quot;You can't be serious, that's way to much.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, you can always check for a cheaper place,&quot; said the nasal guy in a smartass way, &quot;But I feal obligated to warn you that other sites aren't as well guarded as this one. And for the Falcon I should actually be charging you extra because it's a more popular ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />The smartass kid had a point. Local criminals were always jacking the more popular ships, like the Falcon. Having to guard one, therefore meant bigger risks.
<br />
<br />&quot;All right.&quot; Lutz finally said and he payed the guy 500 creds and said he could fill the fuel, bats and bots, but to lay of the repairs. The rest would be payed when they left.
<br />
<br />They took a train from the site and got off at a small shopping centre.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the hart of Broadway.&quot; Lutz said as they walked through the mall.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's not as big as you'd expect it, but it's got everything you need.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael took a quick look at Lutz and saw the expression on his face. It said &quot;Home&quot;.
<br />
<br />Michael forgot what it felt like to be home. He'd been roaming through Sirius the last couple of years. His last home was Mactan and he seriously doubted he would see it again. It would probably have been distroyed, just like the other criminal strongholds.
<br />
<br />Lutz on the other hand, had settled and had made himself a life at Manhattan. Something Micheal could only hope for.
<br />
<br />They left the mall and went down a wide lane, with stores, cafe's and restaurants at both sides. Some were open, but most were closed. It was late and most people were asleep. Only the odd barwalker stroled along the sidewalk, making his way to the next bar.
<br />
<br />they turned left into an alley and halted in front of a big appartmentbuilding. It was like 50 stories high and Michael looked up to it.
<br />
<br />&quot;We only need to go to the twelfth story.&quot; said Lutz. &quot;If she still lives here.&quot; He quietly added.
<br />
<br />They entered the lobby and went to the desk.
<br />
<br />Behind the desk stood a short but attractive lady, dressed in a tight lavender colored outfit.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good evening sir. What can I do for you?&quot; she said with a bright smile. Her big eyes looked staright into Michaels eyes, who was too stunned to utter a word. He pointed to Lutz, stumbeling some words to make it clear to the lady that Lutz was the man who did the talking.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm here for Alys Walsh, appartment 12E.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The woman looked at her screen for a moment and then turned back to Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;Is she expecting you?&quot; she asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.&quot; lied Lutz. They both realised they had come at a strange hour.
<br />
<br />The woman looked at her screen again and gently shook her head as she looked back at Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry, I dont'see anything here. The residents here announce visitors. That's policy.&quot; She smiled, but no matter how big her smile was, it didn't resolve the situation. They had to convince her to let them through. Michael stepped forward.
<br />
<br />&quot;Look, we Just came all the way from the other side of Manhattan today to see Alys. The transport from SoHo was delayed for four hours so we missed our connection with the Magtube to here. It took us nearly twenty hours to get here. I'm sure if you call her she will let us upstairs.&quot;
<br />
<br />The woman hessitated for a moment but eventually picked up the phone.
<br />They could here the phone ring a few times. Michael hoped Alys would wake up and pick it up. He didn't like to use force, but he was sure he would if the situation called for it.
<br />
<br />After a minute she put down the phone.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry, but she doesn't answer. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.&quot;
<br />
<br />She actually seemed genually sorry and Michael felt a **** for having to make his way to the woman behind the counter. She didn't have enough time to react and Michael took out his gun and pointed it at the woman.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, what the hell are you doing!&quot; shouted Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm realy sorry lady, but we need to get up there. I wish...&quot;
<br />
<br />But Michael was interrupted by the ringing of the phone. He looked at it and then looked at the woman.
<br />
<br />He ordered her to pick it up and she answered the phone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hel...hello?...Yes I did...there are some people here for you ma'am.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Is that her?&quot; Michael asked. The woman nodded and Michael took the phone out of her hands.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alys Walsh?&quot; He asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes?&quot; the voice on the other side sounded refreshing even though she must have been woken from a deep sleep.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who is this?&quot; asked Alys.
<br />
<br />Lutz asked for the phone but Michael refused to give it to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;You probably don't know me. My name is Michael Armstrong. I'm a friend of Lutz'. I have a message for you, can I come up?&quot;
<br />
<br />a short moment of silence enabled Michael to put down his gun. The woman had crawled back under the counter and shivered with fear.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz is dead. He blew up with West Point. Please, leave me alone.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No wait, please.&quot; shouted Michael through the phone. &quot;I need to talk to you. It's really important.&quot;
<br />
<br />Alys hessitated again, but finally made the dicision.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, but no tricks. I'm armed.&quot;
<br />
<br />She put down the phone and Michael looked at Lutz, who was both ammazed about the gun as enraged about the fact he wasn't alowed to talk to Alys. But Michael spoke before Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry mate, but I didn't want her to freak out hearing your voice.&quot;
<br />
<br />He turned to the woman who was still crawled back under the desk.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry miss, but I felt I had no choice.&quot; and to Lutz, &quot;come on. lets go.&quot;
<br />
<br />They entered the elevator to the twelfed floor.
<br />
<br />&quot;Did your wife always carry a weapon?&quot; Michael asked. he was worried. If she really defened herself with a gun, that meant she expected troubles. And Michael naturally wondered whet kind of troubles that would be...
<br />
<br />&quot;No.&quot; said Lutz. &quot;Did she say she has a gun?&quot; Lutz sounded surprised.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, she must be protecting herself.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why, Manhattan is relatively save right now. I hope she doesn't shoot us first thing.&quot;
<br />
<br />The elevator stopped and they got out, making their way accross the hall and stopped in front of a door with a decorative E.
<br />
<br />Lutz knocked and a moment later the door opened slightly and a cute face peaked through the narrow opening.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alys?&quot; Lutz asked hopeful and he was just in time to catch his fainting wife.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, at least she recognised you.&quot; said Michael. As they entered the house and layed Alys down on the couch, he couldn't deny the knawing fealing in the back of his mind, that something was going to go terrebly wrong.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;Crap! I realy needed that wing!&quot; Roger looked as the left wing fell to the ground. As he was watching the wing fall off he saw something familiar - a Falcon. He crashed next to the Falcon and examined the ship. &quot;Nope, this is not Michaels ship.&quot; he tells to himself and starts pulling the wing that fell off to the cargo bay of Anubis. When he gets the wing to the cargo bay, its floor fells off. Roger gets a little angry and kicks his ship. Just as he thinks that he shouldn't of done that, the engine starts burning and cockpit falls togeter. O'Connor frustratley sits down on the right wing of his ship and thinks about all his bad luck. &quot;Maybe this thing with un-named ships is true?&quot; he thinks &quot;I must name the ship!&quot; then he looks the Anubis another time and says &quot;Or whats left of it... Anyways this ship will now be called <i>Seth </i> , afterall he had lowtimes in his life also.&quot; It was getting cold on the dark side of Manhatten soon and its even colder outside where it dops to minus twenty degrees. Roger gets out his ships console board and logs in to the Liberty News Systems. Least now he has something to do while waiting or somebody to give him a lift. He searched anything he could find on himself to see at something familiar in this cold godforsaken place with 5 billion strangers. 
<br />
<br />+------------------------------------+
<br />/ Searching:[u O'Connor[/u, Roger    /
<br />/ Found: 6 articles                    /
<br />+------------------------------------+
<br />
<br /><i>Today the court order has been decleared about Michael Armsotrong for loss of his wingmen in the badlands. Their wing was strongly outnumbered, but they were brave and took out three times as much enemys. Liberty Navy accused him of being a coward and letting his wingmaen down. Also they say that he didn't run a proper check on pilots and their ships confirming that they are able to survive the fight and ofcourse for engageing the enemys as there were so many of them. Armstrong says that he didn't have a chance to do any other way as his weapos were either destroyed or jammed. As for enemys they had set up a trap, because there didn't seem to be much enemys. Some skeptics belive that the jury was being bribed, some even go to cooperation with Liberty rogues. Court has centenced Micheal Armstrong to 10 years of hard labor wich will be served in California System. Also we have got a number of Rogue killed names. Navy has classified the names of their lost pilots. The families of pilots serving in Navy are throwing lawsuits on Navy already...
<br />Kills: ...Kirs, Andreas; Puhm, Aivar; V&#228;ra, Hannes; O'Connor, Helen; Sau, T&#245;nis; Harakas, Silver...   </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;Wow!&quot; Roger yelled as he saw Helens name flash in the screen, but this said that she was dead. &quot;But, if she is dead, then who is the woman I saw in the Raiders base, and took on board the Vengeance?&quot; this was all too confusing to O'Connor. &quot;I have noticed that she is little different form before, but still, they look so much alike. I'd better send a message to Danson!&quot; He took out his camm and sent a message signal bouncing from every mjor system and bigger bases in idependent worlds. The signal would be very weak when it will reaches to <i>Vengeance </i> or<i> Malaga </i> if <i>Vengeance </i> has already moved out. Also this new Kursari incription should work better. And Roger started typing a message to Danson....

			<div class="content">malystryx wakes up with a splitting headache
<br />
<br />Malys: uggghhhh
<br />
<br />malys realizes that she is bound, gaged and blindfolded. suddenly she hears two sets of foot steps approaching. the two men (presumably) were arguing in rapid german. suddenly one of the men kneels next to here and presses a hypospray to her neck and she is injected  with a tranquilizer. she pretends to fall unconscious. <i>you ****ing idiots you don't know who i am do you? don't you realize i am resistant to drugs?  </i>.when the men were gone malystryx started to free her bonds.finally after about 15 minutes of struggleing she freed herself. she redid the bonds loosly and waited. when the men returned they were still argueing. when one of them leaned down to dose her she grabbed his neck and twisted. when she heard his neck snap she rose and smashed the other man's throat in to prevent him from screaming. when he stopped thrashing she examined the bodies. they were tall muscular brutes in rhieneland uniforms. she took their pistols and slowly entered the hallway. she proceeded down the hallway until she reached a brightly lit room. in the center of it was a man. the strange thing was his eyes were glowing blue. 
<br />
<br />glowing eye man: you will make a fine host.
<br />malystryx: over my mutilated body you will. 
<br />
<br />malystryx shot the man in the forhead, but to her horror he didn't die. instead he just smiled and advanced on her. she kep on shooting him until he was in arms reach. he reached for her head, but suddenly his body was thrown againest the far wall and was pinned there. to her horror she watched his body burn to cinders. all that remained was a little tinny blue crystal. she realized that the glow was coming from her forhead she quickly looked at a reflective surface and saw a glowing symbol there. it soon faded. unthinkingly she picked up the blue crystal. it burned itself into her palm where it stayed no matter how hard the pull, tugged or twisted. she shivered and set off into the dark passage again. after wandering for a few minutes she ran into a junker security patrol.
<br />
<br />Malystryx: i am lucky i found you, i am lost you see.
<br />security guard: we are here to investigate a stronge, mysterious energy surge from this section have you seen anything?
<br />Malystryx: no,no i haven't
<br />securty guard: what ever you say you are to report to the bridge by the way
<br />
<br />OOC: not that good at fighting scenes
<br />
<br />BEWARE PETTY HUMAN, FOR YOU ARE CHEWY AND GOOD WITH KETCHUP!!!

			<div class="content">OOC: Cue in part two, Excape from Liberty. (x unintentional, but kept it anyway. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh sh*t,&quot; Johnson heard Arrigoni say.
<br />
<br />&quot;What? What's going on?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Seems the law has caught up with us. A battleship just arrived from the opposite end of the tradelane, and it's deploying fighters.&quot; Arrigoni said. &quot;Sorry, Johnson. Can't talk -- just got the order to engage the enemy.&quot;
<br />
<br />Don't die on me, Johnson thought. Johnson peered out the window. A little later he saw blue streams of light being emitted from various places on the battleship. Every once in a while, there was a tiny patch of red light that Johnson correctly took as a ship exploding. It was only a matter of time before they got to Cortez. Or otherwise.
<br />
<br />Johnson became more anxious as time dragged on. What if they didn't make it? What would happen to them? Would they be captured? Or destroyed? Then he decided to put that stuff out of his head. What happened happened, and it was no use worrying about it.
<br />
<br />He felt shakes travel through the ship. Missiles continued to hit the ship. He stopped looking through the window. The sights depressed him.
<br />
<br />The ship lunged forward with incredible force. Over the intercom the operator said, &quot;Welcome to the Cortez system.&quot; There wasn't as much cheering as last time. The thought that they might die was impressed heavily on them.
<br />
<br />Johnson hoped that Liberty wouldn't follow them through the jumphole. Normally they didn't, because of the 'percieved dangers' that Agiera placed upon jumpholes. But everyone had heard what they did, and maybe they could make a special exception.
<br />
<br />The battleship rattled violently in the few seconds it was in the jumphole. Then the rumblings of the missiles, the violent shaking, the blue streams of light, stopped. Everything was silent.
<br />
<br />But everyone was reluctant to cheer. The fighter escorts popped out, badly damaged, and heading to the docking bay. Their replacements would have to fight if Liberty came through.
<br />
<br />Johnson couldn't see what was going on. The window faced away from what was happening. But he clearly heard 'All fighters to their ships'. This was all going to hell, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />There were a few anxious minutes before Johnson called Arrigoni. &quot;Arrigoni?&quot; No answer. &quot;Arrigoni?!&quot; The tension in his voice increased.
<br />
<br />And unfamiliar voice responded. &quot;He's in critical condition right now.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Make sure he lives.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Will do.&quot;
<br />
<br />A few minutes later Johnson realized how lucky Arrigoni was. There were many out there who weren't.
<br />
<br />Apparently the fighter line was holding up pretty well, because Liberty went to it's second plan of attack versus a battleship. The <i>Arizona </i> was gonna have on helluva boarding party.
<br />
<br />Johnson unholstered his two Agiera plasma pistols. He heard &quot;Boarding party, sections two and twelve! Calling everybody!&quot; The person on the intercom was indeed scared.
<br />
<br />Johnson made his way as quickly to section twelve as he could.
<br />
<br />He met section twelve with fighting. He immediately pitched in with his shooting. Some crazy soldier yelled at the top of his lungs &quot;BOARDING PART--&quot; Johnson put a shot right in his throat.
<br />
<br />The criminals were fighting on both sides of the corridor, but the side Johnson wasn't on failed in it's defense, and soldiers poured through that opening. One of the people caught sight of was wearing a Rheinland uniform. Johnson decided to shoot him in the back as he was running away. Sure they're allies, but why would Rheinland and Liberty personnel be mixing? Johnson thought. This was getting too confusing.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;BOARDING PARTIES IN SECTIONS 2 AND 12!!!!&quot;
<br />
<br />malystryx runs down  the hallway to section 2. when she turned the corner to the section she heard gunfire.  malystryx pulled out a fully automatic rhieneland assault pistol and a knife as she rounded the corner. she ended up to be behind the boarding party. she opened fire while similtaniously throwing the knife at a rhieneland officer. she managed to kill 5 of them before they realized that they were under attack. her knife took the officer through the throut. suddenly her abdomin exploded in pain. she had caught a shot through the gut <i>f*uck!!! that hurt!!!! </i>.  the next few minutes were a bloody haze but when she came to a medic was leaning over her and was injecting her with something. 
<br />medic: i wouldn't try to do anything if i were you, you just got a plasma round through your gut.
<br />malystryx: uuuggghhh....
<br />after the fighting was over, johnson showed up with a bandaged arm and a big grin. malystryx had managed to prop herself up on a wall and was watching a group of junkers search the corpses.
<br />
<br />Johnson: you look like sh*it, did you know that?
<br />malystryx: come a little closer and i might make you feel worst. what happened to the boarders?
<br />johnson: some crack-head outcast accidentally shot a rhieneland guy with a grenade. the explosion severed the docking clamps. 
<br />*several nearby outcasts give johnson dirty looks*
<br /> malystryx: so we won?
<br />Johnson: nope not by a long shot, there is still a battleship out there and a few soldiers still on the loose. did you notice anything odd about the soldiers?
<br />malystryx:no why?
<br />johnson: well some are liberty and some are rhieneland
<br />malaystryx: that is odd.... probably there is some treaty now
<br />johnson: huh, well what ever, seeya

			<div class="content">OOC: This happens before malystryx's post. I'll include hers in.
<br />
<br />Johnson wiped the sweat off his face as he took a ten second break from fighting to get cover. Red and green and blue and orange shots were flying back and forth in the crowded corridor. The likelihood of getting shot was greater than getting wet in a shower.
<br />
<br />A shower, Johnson thought. That'd be nice. Johnson peeked up from his cover, both pistols in hand, and sprayed a few shots around the corridor. He sure as heck couldn't aim; doing so would prove fatal. If I could only get one of those rifles, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />Then the mixed house forces made a terrible mistake. They decided to press forward. Those poor men, dropping like flies, Johnson thought. Well, that's over, Johnson thought. The light show ceased, at least for the moment. Johnson holstered his pistol and grabbed a Rheinland rifle. He took a few grenades as well. Why didn't they use these? Johnson thought. Dumb as hell seargent, probably. His comrades did similar things.
<br />
<br />&quot;Holy sh*t that was tough.&quot; one criminal exclaimed.
<br />
<br />&quot;No duh, captain obvious.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, we can kill eachother later, but let's kill those Liberty pricks and Rheinland huns first.&quot; said another.
<br />
<br />Stupid arguing ensued. Johnson wisely did not take part in it. He turned the corner only to find house forces approaching on their position. Unfortunately, they saw him.
<br />
<br />&quot;We've got hostiles! We've got hostiles!&quot; Johnson shouted at the top of his voice. He came back around the corner and peeked down the hallway. Criminals were organizing behind him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Surrender now! You're surrounded and we are on your ship.&quot; said a Rheinland officer.
<br />
<br />&quot;Straight to hell with you, hun!&quot; Johnson unloaded a few shots. None hit. Dammit, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;You suck with a rifle!&quot; a criminal exclaimed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Shut up!&quot; The lightshow continued. Johnson didn't want to spend fifteen more minutes in a stalemate. So he thought he might end it quickly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Fire in the hole!&quot; Johnson hurled a grenade around the corner. One of the elite soldiers was either a damn good shot, or severely lucky, because he hit Johnson's arm on the way around, and the grenade fell short. Sh*t, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />The heat singed hair off his arm. Fortunately, no one was hurt by it, but his arm screamed with pain. Johnson put the rifle behind his back, and took out one of his pistols.
<br />
<br />He felt very ineffective. Oh well. There were plenty of other people who still have rifles.
<br />
<br />Just as Johnson was thinking that, a shot hit a criminal in the leg, and he fell down. Make that one less.
<br />
<br />&quot;Somebody hurl another grenade, and don't get your arm shot.&quot; Johnson said.
<br />
<br />A criminal complied, with a &quot;Fire in the hole!&quot; His didn't fall short, and it made Johnson glad to see the soldiers scramble.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice throw!&quot; Another criminal exclaimed. The grenade exploded, and the soldiers fell. The criminal who threw the grenade grinned.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, let's take a minute.&quot; Johnson said. The criminals were all too eager to comply. Johnson tended to his wound. It wasn't very good, but it would do until he could get medical attention. Johnson checked out a schematic display, and it displayed almost all of the outside of the ship in red. Fortunately, the engine was still functional, and they were moving, though not at a remarkable pace. Johnson checked section twelve, and it showed that the corridor they just cleared led directly to the boarding ship.
<br />
<br />Their minute was up, and the criminals moved down the nearly cleared corridor, rifles up and ready to shoot.
<br />
<br />They turned the corner.... and there were soldiers pouring out of the hole. &quot;For God's sake....&quot; a criminal said.
<br />
<br />An Outcast shot a Rheinland soldier who had just taken the pin out of a grenade he intended to throw at the criminals. It landed in the hole. It exploded. Johnson felt wind on a battleship, something you were definitely not supposed to feel. The ship's computer, sensing a loss of air, activated the bulkhead doors, which closed right in front of Johnson.
<br />
<br />This is one f***ed up ship, Johnson thought. Why didn't they activate when the boarding ship latched on? Some real tech genius needs to fix this ship's computer good.
<br />
<br />&quot;I think that should pretty much do it for section twelve.&quot; Johnson said. &quot;I hope the other sections did just as well.&quot;
<br />
<br />His comrades slouched upon walls, sat down, breathed deep, or other energy restoring activities. Johnson, however, remembered his wound, and went to find a medic. &quot;Medic! Medic!&quot; Johnson called.
<br />
<br />He was still wary though, so he kept his pistol up.
<br />_____________________________________________
<br />
<br />Johnson found one in section five, predicably, by the infirmary. The medic tended to his wound properly, and he placed a good-sized bandage on his arm.
<br />
<br />After he was done, Johnson decided to look for Arrigoni. He fought hell out there. So he went to check up on him. He found Malystryx along the way.
<br />
<br />&quot;You look like sh*it, did you know that?&quot; Johnson asked. Truth be told, she did. She was on a stretcher with a bandage spanning her waist.
<br />
<br />&quot;Come a little closer and i might make you feel worst. What happened to the boarders?&quot; she asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Some crack-head Outcast accidentally shot a rhieneland guy with a grenade. The explosion severed the docking clamps.&quot; Some of the Outcasts gave him dirty looks. Oops, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;So we won?&quot; She eagerly asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nope not by a long shot, there is still a battleship out there and a few soldiers still on the loose.&quot; The people outside definitely fought a harder battle, and still are. &quot;Did you notice anything odd about the soldiers?
<br />
<br />&quot;No, why?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well some are Liberty and some are Rhienland.&quot; Johnson said.
<br />
<br />&quot;That is odd.... Probably there is some treaty now&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Huh. Well, whatever. Seeya.&quot; Johnson said. He walked off, but one outcast was still glaring at him. He glared back.
<br />
<br />Johnson asked a doctor if he had anybody by the name of Arrigoni in one of the beds. The doctor said he didn't know. Johnson went on to describe the physical appearance of Arrigoni. The doctor pointed him to a room.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh God,&quot; Johnson said upon seeing Arrigoni's condition. Broken bones, severe burns.... He was not in good shape.</div>
