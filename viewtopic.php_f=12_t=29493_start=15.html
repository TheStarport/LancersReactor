			<div class="content">@archie I grew up in a town called Ashton which is 5 miles from St Helens - and I didn't get Potato Men at all...its not a local thing, its just crap <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Aussie movies - Mad Max was great, wasn't that aussie? Or am I mistaken and it was secretly hollywood funded?  Also &quot;Walkabout&quot; is a great movie...bit of a classic in fact.  I've gotta admit we don't hear much about other aussie movies unless they contain Kylie when she was 8, but I'm sure there must be some good ones.
<br />
<br />British movies - whoever it was who slagged off the british movie industry needs a good slapping.  The Ealing comedies, imho, were some of the best movies of the last century...not to mention the Guy Ritchie movies that came out in the 90s (smoking barrels, snatch blah blah blah).
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, I love hollywood blockbusters, but after a while I crave something intelligent - and I'm afraid to say that european cinema (actually russian and japanese too) blow the pants off the americans when it comes to movies that require you to have more than one brain cell.

			<div class="content">Aussie sci-fi (and Aus films in general) = excellent. The Quiet Earth is superb sci-fi, far superior to 28 Days later or even Night of the Comet. As far as other stuff goes, Peter Weir's work alone puts Ozfilms up there with the best, even if there were nothing else. 
<br />
<br />Also, quite often you find that when the latest &quot;original&quot; Hollywood offering comes out to acclaim, there's a recent Aus film that the Hollywood version is based on, but the Aus original is superior. I cite Priscilla, Queen of the Desert v. Too Wong Foo as a prime example.
<br />
<br />NZ cinema is also fookin' excellent, even before Peter Jackson and LOTR.</div>

<br />Don't know if all these artists I see in New York would agree with you.  On the whole, they are malnourished, living in relatively impoverished enclaves but are quite ingenious with making do.  They make their &quot;art&quot; (I have no way of knowing whether it is or isn't &quot;art&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.  I don't know where these loafer artists may be but they certainly not here.

I've traveled in artist circles here where I am, from school to school and I continually see people who don't live in the real world, on someone else's dollar without a thanks or an acknowledgement and often adding insult or disgust against society.  Some of them are nice people and can be fun to be around, but they're horrible artists and aren't worth a dime, yet they are never denied scholarships, tools, materials and a toleration that few others ever get.  I have not been impressed with them on the whole whether it be their works or their character and there are thousands in my area alone.
<br />
<br />&quot;On the whole, they are malnourished, living in relatively impoverished enclaves but are quite ingenious with making do.&quot;
<br />
<br />Their choice, not mine to support them.
<br />
<br />&quot;They make their &quot;art&quot; (I have no way of knowing whether it is or isn't &quot;art&quot;.&quot;
<br />
<br />If you can tell me what food is, you can tell me if something is art or not.  I don't like Mexican food, but I can tell you it is food.  I don't ever want to try someone's excrement and I can certainly tell you that isn't food.  The same way with art.  I may not like all of it, but there is a difference between art and crap. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know where these loafer artists may be but they certainly not here.&quot; 
<br />
<br />You're either overestimating them or you tolerate an awful lot.
<br />
<br />&quot;If we only promote as &quot;art&quot; things that &quot;people like to see,&quot; what do we get? Do we get Grant Wood's American Gothic or do we get the Addams Family?&quot;
<br />
<br />I just learned a lot about you from your choices you gave me.  But as to what people want to see ... Of the works in museums the majority were made originally for private individuals to use, to enjoy or to own themselves.  Whether a clay pot with an ornate design from 3000 BC Mesopatamia, a commissioned portrait for a merchant or a Monet painting, these things were purchased by individuals originally.
<br />
<br />An true artist has a choice in how to do his art.  Either make something and hope it sells or be commissioned to do works.  As most fall into the first category, they take onto themselves the risk of what might and might not sell.  There are certainly going to be some who try to cater to the mainstream with dull originality, as do movies and television that want to make a buck.  But it doesn't mean that the truly gifted artists won't be able to make their works.  People do recognize the difference between quality art and targeted martketing.  To think otherwise is to underestimate normal people.
<br />
<br />What people want to see doesn't automatically transfer to safe, unoriginal art as your post would lead me to believe.  There are lots of people who love art and do pay for it.  And there is no excuse for artists not to be able to make it on their own these days with all the variable options for selling their art: Originals, serigraphs, lithographs, glicees, molds, fabrications etc.  There are more ways today to sell the same work over and over again than ever before.  Not to mention the vast more resources they have to distribute their work.
<br />
<br />Other industries of life naturally weed out the great doers from the poor ones.  We go to this restaurant because their food is good, we don't go to that one because their food is bad, it's called discriminating tastes.  Thus after time, the poor restaurant will be gone as it cannot survive with its poor quality.  By some vast support system from undiscriminating govermental dollars the low-quality artists, for the most part, are allowed to remain bad artists and keep taking regardless of not having an audience for their work.  The system of how we as a society decide things is undermined so that we are not allowed to whittle out the crap.

			<div class="content">this is a long-standing argument that I once had very strong opinions on, but less so these days.
<br />
<br />this subject of patronisation and subsidised art came up in my Form follows Function thread but I chose not to pursue it, however it is moot now.
<br />
<br />yes, a lot of subsidised art is bl**dy b*ll*cks and is a waste of public money, but on that basis would you go to the other extreme and say that it should stand or fall on its own merits and if an artist can't sell it he/she is therefore cr*p? Or should all art be done for the &quot;love&quot; and money not come into it?
<br />
<br />In reality despite loud headlines every now and then about the latest outrage to the public purse by some &quot;up and coming&quot; artist, arts grants are difficult to get and almost always dwindling in supply. We cannot as a society abandon the arts to market forces or hardly anything new will be achieved, we don't live in 15thC Florence after all.
<br />
<br />I can tell you dozens of stories about drunken/drug-addicted pseuds who skank the Arts Council for grants which just get frittered then they'll knock some rubbish out at the last minute. So what? Considering the relative pittance that does get spent publicly on the Arts, I don't mind that much; for all the duffers, there's always someone with real talent who needed a boost up.
<br />
<br />I went to college with a girl called Nicola Counsell who I thought at the time was fonk, but she got a DES bursary to do an MA in Fine Art, and now sells her paintings for upwards of &#163;30K; she comes from a council estate near Dudley. If not for public funding she'd be working in some office somwehere, or a factory. In retrospect her work's pretty good.
<br />
<br />Don't foget there's a big gulf between those who do it and those who talk about it, who are often dilettantes, but a necessary link in the commercial chain between artist and buyer. Many artists are often from poor backgrounds and unfortunately talent usually isn't enough to make it, you need connections and patrons; starving artists in garretts are a bourgeois fantasy.
<br />
<br />I myself used to paint and sold quite a bit but the stuff i really enjoyed and put real creativity into invariably got turned down as it was disturbing and considered distasteful; but when I was doing stuff that was little more than decoration in my eyes, like for posh peoples houses or offices, I'd cream up off that work - whatever load of old tosh it was. I could live off Ebay doing watercolurs of potbanks and bottlekilns and copies of old photos of Hanley and Burslem, get &#163;50 each for those, but I'd just feel like a whore and a fraud doing that. And that's pretty much the way it is - artists have to eat to.</div>

<br />The way I look at it, why waste time with indifference? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  BTW, why did you edit your post so long after?
<br />
<br />@Taw, true some people can be aided by grants.  But I trust a grant from individuals, a group or schools that actually critique what they give grants for over the government doing it.  And there are LOTS of groups that do it with a great amount of success in their program and the artists they promote.
