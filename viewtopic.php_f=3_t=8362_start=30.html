			<div class="content">I agree with the thing about the colors. I was a bit disappointed at not being able to slap my favorite red/black scheme or at least my logo on the ships, but oh well. At least you can choose what weapons you mount, hmm? And someone will eventually start coming out with skinning tools and such. 
<br />
<br />And no matter how much you might initially hate a design, I've found that when it saves your life a few times, you can't bear to part with it anyway.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<h3><a href="#p94123" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Here is what I thought of the ships.
<br />
<br />Liberty:
<br />Some of the best looking ships come from Liberty. The Patriot and Defender are both neat looking ships. Defender is one of my personal favorites. The cruisers and battleships are a sight to behold. They look like they would actually exist in such a future. Liberty ships appear to be influenced by the Wing Commander designs.
<br />
<br />Bretonia:
<br />These ships are very odd looking. From the light fighters to the battleships. These ships would have been more believable to me if they were custom made and hard to come by. Instead, they are the mass-produced vessels of that particular area of space. When looking at Bretonian ships, I get a very &quot;this looks like something out of Star Wars&quot; feeling.
<br />
<br />Kusari:
<br />Neat. Unique. Definitely of Japanese origin. Well, more so of the fighters. The battleships look rather awkward. Another kind of ship that makes me think of Star Wars. Kusari ships make you think that they come from watery worlds. What do you know? They do! However, the differences between light and heavy Kusari fighters isn't that much. Especially from a distance.
<br />
<br />Rheinland:
<br />Now these ships definitely look like something that came from the Starlancer universe. Rugged, overly mechanical vessels. I like them. Rheinland warships definitely gave me a sense of power and their fighters are rather good. Like Kusari fighers, it's hard to tell the difference between them from a distance. They look even more similar up close.
<br />
<br />Non-Major House Ships:
<br />A little disappointing that only the major houses have gunboats, cruisers, and battleships. Though the Order has the Osiris, it's a Liberty designed ship. Non-major house craft look very similar to each other from within their respective clan. The light fighters are the base design and the heavy fighters just add certain struts and wings. The Anubis is the only entirely original fighter design out of them all.
<br />
<br />Freighters:
<br />I don't care much for the freighters. The only major house freighter that doesn't look like the respective fighters is the Liberty one.
<br />
<br />My Opinion:
<br />The variety of design in this game could have been greater. This is going to sound hostile of me, but anyone who disagrees with me is only fooling themselves into believing that this game is everything it could have been. On a further note, for a game that took this long to make, the campaign could have been longer, the freelance missions more varied/involving, and certain aspects like NPC traffic, engine differences (all ships move at the same speed in this game), and NPC dialogue (I got tired of hearing the same lines over, and over, and over) could have been so much better. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool game. But I don't believe this game lived up to the hype and I know that deep down you all feel that way too.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p94199" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Since I wasnt planning on buying this game anyway because
<br />of the non-joystick issue, I'm almost completely satisfied
<br />with the product. 
<br />
<br />
<br />What I would have changed. The game would have been completely customize able. No single player story line ( I'm sure game companys get nervouse when you say things like that)
<br />
<br />You would start the game by picking your character name sex, skin tone, hair and voice then you pick your starting faction and system) which in turn determines your starting ship and system.
<br />
<br />You would also pick a nickname out of a large number that the NPCs would call you. Like  Ace or Boss , Cha-chi  whatever.
<br />
<br />The ability to name your ship , this also gives it an id.
<br />That can be hacked to read something else so you can sneak into 
<br />areas that hate you.
<br />
<br />at any time you can pay a small fee to get your ship painted
<br />
<br />thrusters to wieght ratio should determine speed
<br />
<br />a power plant that determines shield and gun power recharge rates
<br />(the shield batteries should automaticly recharge the shield when they are out)
<br />
<br />and ship dealers should be like used care dealers
<br />this is a huge city with thousands of ships flying around and you are telling me he only has a few to sell?
<br />
<br />The ability to hire mercenarys to guard you when making shipments
<br />or become your pirates.
<br />
<br />or pilots to pilot your cargo ship while you defend it.
<br />
<br />The turrets should fire on there own, or you should be able to pick a priorty target for the turrets.
<br />
<br />The ability to own and operate a crusier class ship and buy your own space station.
<br />
<br />The ability for your buddy to join up and take controls of the turrets on your ship.
<br />
<br />Better damage modeling.
<br />
<br />multiple 25 year time lines for all systems.
<br />with major events happening in each.
<br />and a randomizer so when you start a new game it picks time
<br />lines for each system.
<br />So each system feels alive.
<br />and in each time line you setup story events that 
<br />you may or may not be there for.
<br />If you are in the right system at the right time 
<br />you can have a cut scene and some added story and history.
<br />
<br />
<br />I know this sounds like alot 
<br />and its hard to produce a game that would have all 
<br />these things and a quality graphics engine.
<br />In a certain time frame and under a certain budget.
<br />
<br />Freelancer is a step in the right direction, 
<br />it is a great game and a lot of fun to play
<br />it has torn me away from DAOC which is saying alot.
<br />but some parts of the game feel unfinished.
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">Dude, why do you type like that?  It makes it really hard to read.
<br />
<br />Yes, we all woulda liked those kind of things (well, except for a SP campaign, all games except MMOG's should have a good SP campaign) but the fact is we didn't get them.  So, we can sit and complain, or we can buy the game, and make it worth MS's and DA's time and money to give us an expansion pack and/or a SDK.  Oh yeah, we can also enjoy the stuff that <i>did </i> make it in.
<br />
<br />Yes, I know I sound like a Star Wars junkie on May 20th, 1999 trying to defend Episode I, but Freelancer lived up to a lot more of its hype than TPM did, although both fell short.

<br />There are only 10 kinds of people in the world:

			<div class="content">I did buy it.
<br />
<br />Did you not read about how I enjoy the game? or how I told people to go buy it.
<br />I'm also trying to get some friends on mine to go buy it for some MP action
<br />but they arent sure yet because of the mouse issue. (which I have told them will surprise them after an hour or so of play.)
<br />
<br />Unreal Tournament did not have a single player campaign.
<br />(and if you would have read my suggestion, it was clear after reading my suggestions for time lines that you would be in effect creating your own single player campaign)
<br />
<br />
<br />I think Episode 1 was a better movie than episode 2.
<br />
<br />I like to use double spacing to seperate ideas.
<br />
<br />There is a thing called constructive criticism, learn how to recognize it. I presented my ideas and opinions in a clear and intelligent manner 
<br />without saying this game is the roxxors or the suxxors. There are a lot of trolls
<br />on the internet, I'm not one of them.
<br />But I will not sit by and defend something till I'm blue in the face  because I'm also not a fanboy. I am a fan and can accept the short commings of certain media, it doesnt make me less of a fan  suggest things or think about things 
<br />that I would like changed our included into such media.
<br />
<br />I'm a roberts fan I have owned all of the wing commander games (except privateer). I gave the roberts boys my money and this is where I get to use my voice to speak up about the things I would like to see in game.
<br />
<br />If you feel the need to not post about add-ons and game enhancements feel free to not do so, but please do not tell me to not post mine. So if you have Ideas for add-ons and enchancements please post, I would love to hear them.</div>

			<div class="content">Hey, first post.
<br />
<br />Anyway, wanted to add to the discussion here.  I think DA did a fantastic job on the designs, they're indicative of the regions they hail from.  Nowadays it's too easy to fall into the trappings of established designs, where everything looks like we've seen in the movies.  That would get boring.
<br />
<br />Here we have designs inspired from four different societies that, after landing in their sleeper ships, no doubt progressed on their own technologically for a while before joining the colonial economy.  Their unique identities and histories influenced their ship designs.  It's a pretty cool thing to have in the game, since you're not forced to play in any specific ships by the nature of the game.  Cool stuff, and I think DA should get a pat on the back for breaking the mold to come up with something original.</div>
