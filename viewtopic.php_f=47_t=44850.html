<br />THE STAR LOG OF A FREELANCER
<br />BY Zeta1
<br />
<br />
<br />NEW LONDON, NEW LONDON SYSTEM, MARCH 16TH, 801A.S.
<br />THE THREE KINGS PUB. ENTRY&#8217;S OF BLAKE MORMON
<br />
<br /> Here I am, starting this neural net log to keep track of everything ill do making my fortune in the stars. I&#8217;ve bought myself a simple starflier, rudimentary weapons, and an old rusted thruster.
<br />
<br /> The ship is so old I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it fell apart before it exited the docking ring&#8217;s &#8220;starship elevator.&#8221; my father says am crazy to go to space, we were a comfortable upper-middle class. We had our own little
<br />Walsh restaurant.
<br />
<br /> Rack of lamb was my father&#8217;s special, adding his own little spices that he&#8217;d disown me if I told u what they were.
<br />
<br /> But the prospects for makin a boatload o&#8217; money out there are good.
<br />
<br /> When my father heard that, he said &#8220;there are enough pirates, criminals and terrorists to fill two boatloads o&#8217;s of credits spent getting what&#8217;s left of ye from an interstellar vapor cloud.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> I ignored the comment, but that thought of a hull breach slowly asphyxiating me still lingers in my mind.
<br />
<br /> There&#8217;s a gateway rep in the bar I know, who has a younger cousin who&#8217;s campus room mates girlfriend knows a girl married to a factory worker, who knows the person who delivers the polymers he makes on Southampton shipyard to an equipment dealer who repairs the hull of a ship of a freighter that&#8217;s captain delivers synth paste to Canterbury station, the head of planetform inc.
<br />
<br /> a company that terraforms planets. He told the equipment dealer that taking basic supplies from new London to Birmingham station in the Manchester system, then taking terraforming gasses back to Canterbury station you can make a moderate profit off it.
<br />
<br /> So the equipment dealer told the, ah you get my point.
<br />
<br /> So im just grabbing a drink before I head to the commodity dealer for food rations, oxygen, water, consumer goods like basic computer optronics, clothing, and a I added it all up, I and figured out ill be able to take some luxury goods there too.
<br />
<br /> That should add a hefty profit on my way there.
<br />
<br /> Well, better get down to business.
<br />
<br />Birmingham station, Manchester system, march 18th 801 A.S
<br />
<br />Uneventful, that&#8217;s how id have to describe the trip.
<br />
<br /> Okay, now that&#8217;s I total lie.
<br />
<br /> It was looking fine. I was coming up on the gate to Manchester, and I opened my eyes from some half sleeping as I exited the trade lane, only the second time id gone from 1000 to 55 kilometers per hour in 5 seconds.
<br />
<br />  Right as I opened my eyes. A blinding explosion of red, blue, orange, purple, and pink exploded; just about every single alarm on my ship went off, proximity, explosion, radiation, and more. Adrenaline pumped thru my body.
<br />
<br /> I told myself to think straight.
<br />
<br /> My shields were near down from the explosion. One problem from alarm.
<br />
<br /> Second the radiation from the explosion of a freighter&#8217;s engine core in front of me would wear what was left of my shields down in seconds.
<br />
<br /> I punched the shield batteries as hard and fast as I could. It was answered by a big sequel.
<br />
<br /> And I looked down to my controls to see my shields returning to full strength as the electromacntic pulse researched my energy-life-saver.
<br />
<br /> Then the proximity alarm I cam to the entire front section of the transport flew thru space heading right for me!
<br />
<br /> To add to my problems corsair ships blazing out from the explosion at full speed with all weapons firing, I banked hard right to avoid them.
<br />
<br /> I remembered what I overheard someone say in the bar &#8220; when you bank one way or another from the enemy ships, drop a couple of mines.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> I raised my hand do a lever to my top right.
<br />
<br /> If the lever was pulled down, it would relese the mine bay doors, or that&#8217;s how the old inefficient starfleir mine system worked.
<br />
<br /> I banked with my left hand as I pulled the lever and counted to 3 southhampton, as I heard the mines swoosh! Out of their bay. 
<br />
<br />I allowed my self a glimpse back as the explosions rippled thru 2 corsair ships.
<br />
<br /> It was a mistake turning around.
<br />
<br /> I looked backck at my cockpit screen and saw a police cavalier ship almost collide with me, or I almost collided with him &#8220;you bloody sonuva&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br /> a gruff Scottish-Low-Level-Leeds type of voice angrily started. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sorry!&#8221;
<br /> I quickly interjected as he hit his emergency brakes just in time.
<br />
<br /> I pulled back on my stick as hard as possible in a loopy-loop I my stomach definitely did not approve of, and had no problem complaining to me about it.
<br />
<br /> I swung out of it in a barrel-role with guns blazing at the corsair &#8220;legionare&#8221; fighter&#8217;s engines.
<br />
<br /> instead of splitting into a different large chunks and a million small pieces and then exploding, in a split second the chain reaction from the fighter&#8217;s fusion reactor ran in to the middle of the ship like a greenish strike of horizontal lighting, then promptly exploded into a fireball. I had had my share of excitement.
<br />
<br /> Just before I went into the jump gate, I activated my tractor beam and salvaged what was left of the pirate ships.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Besieges that, I got to Birmingham uneventful.
<br />
<br /> Just another boring, uneventful day in the life of a freelancer eh? 
<br />
<br />Canterbury station march 21st 801 A.S. 
<br />
<br />This isn&#8217;t good.
<br />
<br /> I don&#8217;t know what to do.
<br />
<br /> Il give you thee extremely quick low-down on what&#8217;s just happened.
<br />
<br /> Remember how I salvaged some of the corsair ships?
<br />
<br /> Yea, well I picked up a particular goodie outta it. A corsair Pulse Cannon, or, &#8220;Borroco&#8217;s&#8221; as there called.
<br />
<br /> I tried to outfit it, the equipment dealer told me not to, that it&#8217;d blow out every single one of my systems, but I had to, I almost, as my dad put it earlier, ended up as an interstellar vapor cloud.
<br />
<br /> So I mounted it.
<br />
<br /> I had my gases and I was ready to go, but then it happened.
<br />
<br /> Right as I left the docking bay, I picked up about 30 new contacts on my radar, Birmingham started flashing, guns going on line, ships coming out to defend no, that&#8217;s not the right word for it.
<br />
<br /> Ships coming out to be obliterated.
<br />
<br /> That&#8217;s more like it.
<br />
<br /> More contacts after that came in from the other direction.
<br />
<br /> Then my instruments showed me that every comm.
<br />
<br /> Frequency exploded with a message coming from every ship.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;GAIA WILL NOT BLEED!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> a collective of 60 or so voices said at once, sending a shiver down my spine.
<br />
<br /> Right after that I immediacy realized who it was.
<br />
<br /> A radical eco-terrorist group known as &#8220;Gaians.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> I had heard my College biology professor whom everyday I engaged in heated debates from everything from philosophy to poltics speak of them a lot.
<br />
<br /> About how, they were only &#8220;Fighting for the greater good of Sirius&#8217;s wildlife.&#8221;
<br /> One week later, a knock came to the classroom door.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Come in!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> the thin, gray haired teacher called, as calm as could be.
<br />
<br /> 3 armed forces officers, a tall, pug-nosed colonel with a \ scar stretching from his left-ear down over his eye, just nicking his lips, and strung down his neck like a snake</div>

<br />
<br />He had two lieutenants behind him with needler rifles comfortably half aimed from their sides, and strapped down from their shoulders.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;What can I do for you boys?&#8221; the teacher sarcastically jovially asked.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Are you Edward Pike?&#8221; the younger lieutenant asked.
<br />
<br /> The colonel turned around and shot him as look as if &#8220;Will you shut up you fresh-faced R.O.T.C. pretty boy, or ill have you back down to cadet!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Oh no!!&#8221; the professor cried, noticing the colonel facial language toward the lieutenant.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;We allow every one to freely share what they have to say in this classroom!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Whatever you say Mr. Pike&#8230;&#8221; I muttered purposely loud enough for all to hear.
<br />
<br /> Scattered giggles were heard throughout the room as my left-wing professor shot me a quick glare.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;And to answer what your lieutenant asked so politely for you colonel,&#8221; he quickly attempted to disregard my comment and sarcastic as ever turned back to the men as the lieutenant turned 6 shades redder.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;I am Edward Rossel Pike!
<br />
<br /> Thee one!
<br />
<br /> The only!
<br />
<br /> The brilliant!
<br />
<br /> the Revolutionary thinker!
<br />
<br /> The one challenging the lies that are spun like holed sweaters from the anti-green-front Cambridge fools who call themselves scientists!
<br />
<br /> and the corrupt government, only pawns and puppets of the even corrupter military and police forces!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;If I were a Lane Hacker or outcast,&#8221; I started. &#8220;id much rather be captured by liberty police inc. sergeant and try to bribe them than A Bretonian Constable.
<br />A real police officer? Or a phony corporate one that&#8217;s more interested in staffing cheap, sweatshop consumer goods factory hand-labor or smelter prison ship than keep peace and delivering justice to criminals.&#8221; I interjected.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Quiet!&#8221; the professor screamed back.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Why professor,&#8221; the gruff colonel spoke for the first time.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;I thought everyone was able to freely voice their opinions.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> the professor started to fidget and twiddle his thumbs.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;and.. uh.. uh.. of course they must raise their hands at first.&#8221; The professor let out a sheepish smile, one filled with doubt and fright, such as that of finding himself caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Frankly Professor, I don&#8217;t care if your students are forced to learn how to fly an air-skiff and guzzle that liberty synth paste crud they try and call food at the same time.
<br />
<br /> All I have are my orders and they are to take you into custdody for suspected fund-raising of credits to be sent to the Gaians.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;WHAT!!&#8221; the professor exploded. &#8220;ON WHAT GROUNDS?!&#8221; he cried.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;We will discuss this at a later time.
<br />
<br /> You have to the right to remain silent and right to an attorney if you&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; the colonel Miranda righted on.
<br />
<br /> And so just as suspected, the professor was convicted guilty of the crimes accused, and to serve in prison for 10 years.
<br />
<br /> Lucky for me I was out of college by the time he got out, hehe.
<br />
<br /> But back to where we were.
<br />
<br /> long story much shorter, the equipment dealer was right, and when I tried to fire the borroco blew out just about everyone of my circuits, on minimal engines and life support, I barely reached the trade lane, guiding my craft on inertia into the jump gate, and from on that side over to the next trade lane, using only the inertia I could. I sold the gasses, made a nice profit.
<br />
<br /> Lost my ship, still have the weapons at least. I don&#8217;t know what to do now, I have almost 30,000 credits, so I can get a ship and some weapons.
<br />
<br /> Ill just try and take job im given. That&#8217;s all for now. I think ill get some rest.
<br />
<br />EN ROUTE TO BATTLESHIP SUFFOLK, NEW LONDON SYSTEM, APRIL 2ND, 801 A.S.
<br /> 
<br />	What has happened in the last 10 days has been shocking.
<br />
<br /> The molly&#8217;s, a terrprist faction of old miners bent on freeing the Dublin system, have launched incredible new waves of attacks.
<br />
<br /> The Battleship &#8220;Essex&#8221; the ship watching the Dublin side of the New London to Dublin system jump gate, usually attempting to bring what peace they can to the wild system of molly&#8217;s, corsairs, [waging a bloody turf war for the system with the molly&#8217;s for control of the gold there. IMG, or independent Miners Guild, who run the restored Battleship Hood, a center for their free gold mining, gambling, and racing, and the B.M.M., or Bretonia Mining and Metals. [The same guys who try and run Birmingham station. Anyway, the Battleship Essex was lost contact with, their last transmission was the first officer, this is how I remember the when I first heard of what had happened.
<br />
<br />An Anchorman in a clean white suit with a window filled with the smog New London skyline appeared on the log.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;This is the free Bretonian news.&#8221; The man said, his voice shaking slightly.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;In breaking news, the Dublin system has erupted into violence and bloodshed, ships have been captured, hostages taken, ships destroyed, and the Battleship Suffolk has been seemingly destroyed.
<br />
<br /> The Bretonian Armed Forces released this video at a news conference today, it is the last signal received from the Battleship Suffolk.&#8221; The man gulped.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;We must warn you, these following images are graphic, and viewer discretion is advised.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> The man nodded to a man off-screen, his face half filled with fear,  the other half filled with a &#8220;here goes nothing look,&#8221; with a touch of guilt.
<br />
<br /> The screen immediately changed to the bridge of a ship, or what was left of it
<br />
<br />. Smoke filled the room, the terrifying sound of a, KI! KI! KI! A Molly &#8220;Dublin Duster&#8221; laser cannon screamed, followed by the ship rocking, and more alarms going off, than was flown thru the air, landing beyond the monitor, then stepping back. &#8220;Pierce!&#8221; he screamed, trying to remain calm and resolved, though filled with fear.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Aye sir?&#8221; someone on the other side of the smoke, near the front of the bridge answered, his voice wavering.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Is the channel open?&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Open as it will ever be sir!&#8221; he sounded more frightened.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;A simple &#8216;Aye sir&#8217; would have done ensign.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> He turned back to the screen.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;This is the Battleship Essex to all receiving this message,&#8221; he started.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;I am acting-captain Commander William Dirk.
<br />
<br /> The captain is dead and the ship is falling apart.
<br />
<br /> About half an hour ago, hundreds of Molly ships appeared on radar, we have no idea how they got so many ships but right now that&#8217;s not important.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> His face darkened, as if preparing for some more bad news.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;I believe it is in Bretonia&#8217;s best interest we not abandon ship, and allow for more hostages to be taken, the ship wont last much longer, we have fires on all decks, the ships fighter wings are destroyed and depleted, and we have lost internal communications.
<br />
<br /> We require immediate assistance from all&#8230;.&#8221;
<br />
<br />  &#8220;SIR THERE COMING AROUND FOR ANOTHER PASS!!&#8221; the young man off-screen seemingly howled.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;HARD TO STAR..!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> KI! KI! KI!
<br />
<br /> The screen wavered, the man barely visible.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Try and get her thru the jump gate!&#8221; The commander ordered.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Engines off-line!
<br />
<br /> Sir! Their targeting key areas of the ship!
<br />
<br /> The reactor!
<br />
<br /> The hanger bays!&#8221; the ensign stopped.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;What is it?! Report Ensign!&#8221; &#8220;The bridge!&#8221; he said, consumed with fear.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Torpedoes en route! Were not going to make it!!&#8221; he cried.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;BELAY THAT TALK! GET THE TURRETS TO FOCUS ALL THEIR FIRE ON THE TORPEDOES!&#8221; he ordered.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;TURRETS OFF-LINE!&#8221; The ensign screamed again.
<br />
<br /> The commander turned back to the screen, we need assistance! Please&#8230;.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;TORPEDOE IMPACT!&#8221; he screamed. The hole appeared, followed by a large, SWOOSH!! The smoke sucked out, revealing a conn. Officer desperately holding onto his chair.
<br />
<br /> HULL BREACH!!!!!!!!!&#8221;
<br />
<br /> he was sucked out, his voice gone.
<br />
<br /> The Commander lost hold. Doomed to the same fate as the other bridge-officer.
<br />
<br /> The screen wavered again.
<br />
<br /> The air was gone.
<br />
<br /> And their was total peace.
<br />
<br /> No sound.
<br />
<br /> No voices screaming, no sound of torpedoes.
<br />
<br /> The peace disappeared when a molly &#8220;Bloodhound&#8221; light fighter appeared, its sides lighting up with fire.
<br />
<br /> The laser shots destroying what was left of the ship.
<br />
<br /> The screen fuzzed up, then disappeared.
<br />
<br /> The screen came back to the anchorman. &#8220;That was the last transmission from the Essex, No word from any other ships there.
<br />
<br /> Accept for demands that the Molly&#8217;s will kill the hundreds of hostages one by one, if the Bretonian Government does not recognize their new state, &#8220;The Free Republic of New Ireland.&#8221;
<br />
<br /> &#8220;We will have more updates on this later. In other news&#8230;.&#8221;       I switched off the shocking news.
<br />
<br />There you have it, and lucky me, my dad is one of the hostages, im en route to the battleship Suffolk, the Bretonian flagship to serve as a fighting freelancer or bounty hunter, along with other freelancer, armed forces, police, and Bounty Hunters.
<br />
<br /> Threes not much else to the story, all I know is I&#8217;m going to make those molly terrorists pay for what they&#8217;ve done.
<br />
<br /> I&#8217;ll write more later when I get there, currently im stowed away in the cargo hold of a garbage-scow, heading for the Suffolk, I figured I needed to save as much money as possible, that included not having to pay for transport, just sneaking In here.
<br />
<br /> That&#8217;s all for now.
<br />
<br /> Man this place stinks!</div>
