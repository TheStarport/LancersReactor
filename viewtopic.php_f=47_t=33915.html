			<div class="content">OK, kind of the same as my RPG, Total War forum, but no one posted on it. So I give you another one, hopefully you will like this one.
<br />
<br />This is about 50 years before the events of Freelancer happened, so the only Nomads in this thing will be in the Unknown systems and right around the jump holes in Gamma and Alpha.
<br />
<br />The Corsairs and the Outcasts have been at war for almost three hundred years. They had been fighting for so long, no one could remember why it had all started in the first place. Many believed that the Outcasts had stopped supplying the Corsairs with cardimine and started a little battle that led to an all out war. Others think it was started by territorial disputes in Omicron Beta when the Corsairs tried to put a small installation in an Outcast controlled system. What ever the reason, a three hundred year war between the Corsairs and the Outcasts began. The Outcasts with their superior weapons and more maneuverable ships began to slowly gain the upper hand....
<br />
<br />OK, now it is time for your part of the story. Also, the Rhineland Military has tried to stop the war by jumping in.
<br />
<br />Here are the rules.
<br />1) only one character per person to eliminate confusion.
<br />2) the only Nomads in the story are around the Jump Holes and in the unknown systems.
<br />3) You may ether have the Corsairs, the Outcasts or the Rhineland Military as your faction.
<br />4) at the beginning of each part, state your character's name, his current location, current ship and credits. (and be reasonable with the credits, don't go over fifteen million.)
<br />5)  I set any major events like the Rhineland Military getting whipped out and that sort of stuff.
<br />6) and finally, you may create a second character only if you have your first one killed and never come back.
<br />
<br />Well, now it's your turn. And please follow the rules.
<br />P.S. I might make exceptions from time to time.
<br />

<br />
<br /><i>story before i was a prisoner.
<br />they call me Seluka, it's a codename, and i will always be called that way. i'm a happy corsair fighter pilot, my ship is the legionaire. i flew from omega-5 to leeds and from leeds to manchester jumphole.
<br />
<br />I'm now at the Leeds jumphole, i fly toward the nearest planet (Planet Wright) where i will destroy as much as possible, just for fun.
<br />
<br />i didn't knew that their where a few bounty hunters after me by that time, i had already killed to much off them, i think... co'z they where with 8 hammerheads behind me and by the planet where 2 baracudas and 4 piranhas... also i didn't knew off that also...
<br />
<br />i think they knew i was going to their, co'z i think their was a kind off tracking devise on my ship (maded by bounty hunters, set onto the ship by zoners i think).
<br />
<br />when i came by the planet i saw them incoming, tried to turn around and run, but the hammerheads disrupted my fly and my ship was destroyed almost the second after... i couldn't even set myself to attack one off them... they wanted me to badly... i was high money for them... and now they have me...
<br />
<br />they brought me inmediate to BPA Newgate inside a minefield off manchester system... what i can see from the inside off my cell...  </i>
<br />
<br />This is my first day in here, and it totaly sucks, i hate it in here, nothing to do right now... mostly we where blasting others by now...
<br />
<br />i hope their is something to do in here... i hope... co'z this is just boring and time is going slow if i'm right...

<br />Hans was in New Berlin space. His usual order by the millitary high command : Go partol. &quot; Boring&quot; Hans thought &quot; My squardon always ends up partroling the peaceful places, ah well, i suspose there must be a reason.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; This is Rheinland partrol 5-1, is everone here?&quot; asked Hans to the rest of his squardon. &quot; Affrimative Sir&quot; came the reply. &quot; Okay, our order is to partol the space in New Berlin. Same waypoints.&quot; Hans told the squardon as the green cruise engines activated. &quot; Its stupid of the government to try to interfere with this battle of theirs&quot; Hans muttered to himself</div>

<br />Location: Omega-41
<br />Credits: 825,000
<br />
<br />Pedro sat nervously in the cockpit of his Titan Very Heavy Fighter. Blue and white lights were swirling all around him and he was zooming through space faster than anyone could ever imagine. He HATED system jumps.
<br />
<br />A few seconds later, he gradually started to slow and the swirling lights turned into an asteroid field. He looked around glumly. He had been transferred to Leon Base, Omega-41 from Planet Crete due to a lack of soldiers to fight the bounty hunter scum coming out of Freeport 5. He tapped out some commands on a keypad and green brackets suddenly appeared around a large asteroid in his HUD. He activated cruise and headed towards it.
<br />
<br />The Titan, beautiful as it was, was not exactly the most maneuverable ship out there. It slammed into a few asteroids and the shields started to buckle. Finally, he arrived at the asteroid: Leon Base.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Corsairs Green 5-1 to Leon Base, requesting clearance to land.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger, Green 5-1, permission to land is gran- wait! We're showing five bogeys, inbound! Permission to land DENIED, Green 5-1! All Corsairs in the area, move to intercept!&quot;
<br />
<br />Pedro hit his cruise engines again and headed towards the bogeys: Sabres. He was first to intercept them, so all of their fire was turned on him. With some advanced tactics he learned in military school, he managed to take out one of them before a wing of three Titans arrived. It was a long battle, with lasers and neutrons flying everywhere, but in the end the Corsairs prevailed.
<br />
<br />&quot;How did Outcasts get all the way to Omega-41? Surely they would have been stopped in Omicron Theta... I HATE this system...&quot; Pedro grumbled.</div>

			<div class="content">Name: Serg Vorbarra
<br />Ship: Valkrye
<br />Faction: Rheinland Military
<br />Location: Omega 11
<br />Credits: 986,000
<br />
<br />Serg drummed his gloved fingers along the grimy cockpit rim of his Valkrye. His patrol was being let out of the docking bays. He glanced to his right and saw the Valkrye parked next to his slowly lift up and head towards the airlock. He sighed and punched in the co-ordinates for their patrol, enabling the anti-grav un-locking systems and slowly the Valkrye floated up on an air cushion. The docking bay was livid green with the rays from the Valkryes' exhausts. Serg gently manoeuvered the Valkrye around and slowly headed towards the airlock as the ship before him flew out. He followed it out and flew towards the patrol marshalling position. The two who were already there silently waited for the last one. The Battleship Friedrich had been deployed to Omega 11 to curb the increasing amount of Red Hessian crime that was plagueing the Daumann at Solarius. &quot;Okay fellers, nice and easy just passive defensive route today.&quot; Serg droned over the comm. 
<br />
<br />They rounded past the asteroid field and did a flyby of Deidus. Then Jurgen piped up. &quot;Hey do you know what the Hessians do to our guys if they capture us?&quot;
<br />Serg sighed. This wasn't exactly morale boosting but space was boring as it is so he replied tiredly. &quot;No Jurgen, I don't. Please inform us with your second hand source's information.&quot; &quot;I swear it's true! They put us in vac suits or escape pods and launch us into Deidus's atmosphere....If we survive the hurtle through the atmoshpere which is most often the case as we enter the lower parts of Deidus's atmosphere which by the way is entirely composed of minute dust particles that can enter the gaps between the finest Kusari probes, anyway the dust particles easily fill the suit and you die by slow suffocation.&quot; There was a stunned silence. Serg rubbed his eyes. It sounded unlikely but then again this was the border worlds and he'd heard stranger things that turned out to be true. 
<br />
<br />Suddenly an alarm klaxon sounded in Serg's and the other's helmets. Rising radiation levels detected. &quot;****&quot; thought Serg who snapped out of the tired sleep deprived soldier on the front line into an alert commander who's priority was the survival of his men. &quot;Gun it to the asteroid field, SCHNELL!!!!&quot; Serg found an empty display on his cockpit side surface and programmed in radiation display. There it was, a tidal wave of pulsating green slowly obliterating everything in it's path on the display. He was already hearing screams over the comm from the system's other inhabitants. He winced. He shot into the asteroid field and so did the others. But Heinz's ship's AI misjudged an asteroid and clipped it and so the ship's tradjectory was straight down. He failed to make it far enough into the field and when the invisible radiation storm swept through them he was obliterated in a flash of green. The other's ships were violently rocked but their hulls held. 
<br />
<br />As their ships stopped spinning around the field like pinballs they slowly re-grouped and headed for Solarius. Serg grimaced. They had lost Heinz who was a veteran of many criminal base takedowns. He would be sorely missed. &quot;This is Rheinland Military Omega eight dash three...So how you guys holding up out there?&quot; he asked. &quot;This is Rheinland Military Omega nine dash one, I'm okay but lost my port wing...I can probably make it back to Freidrich.&quot; Serg paused, waiting for the other's call. &quot;Schhzztt heinlan schzzzzzzz three slash szzzzzzztttt badly zzzzzzztttt amaged shhhhhh systems offlin--&quot; His comm-link gave out and Serg flew over to him. The pilot motioned towards Solarius with urgency and Serg nodded in acknowledgement. As the pilot flew with an urgent docking request, Serg and Jurgen flew back to the Freidrich. They had to stop twice to help and protect damaged Diamond transports get back to Solarius but eventually made it back to the Battleship Freidrich. He gently flew the Valkrye through the Battleship's dock and parked it roughly in the nearest parking space. A crew of dockworkers in anti-rad suits surrounded his ship and covered it in anti-rad foam. Serg stared blankly through the cockpit's viewports which were quite blackened from the Radiation storm. He didn't even realise he had been given the all-clear until a mechanic banged on the cockpit. Serg stretched and nudged the open switch. There was a sucking sound and with a hiss the cockpit slowly rose up. He jumped down from his blackened ship and strode across the busy docking bays towards the personal quarters. 
<br />
<br />As he strolled down the crowded grey corridors he met Jurgen. &quot;Meet you in the bar in ten minutes for a drink?&quot; Jurgen offered. &quot;My shout.&quot; &quot;Sure, s'just what I need.&quot; replied Serg immediatly. He broke into a run towards his cabin and stepped inside it. The tiny cabin was homely to Serg and housed his personal library and firearms collection. He changed out of the grubby flightsuit into some combat fatigues. He went to his small personal bathroom and rubbed some water over his face. Locking up his quarters, he jogged down towards the nearest lift depot where he found a lift-tube to the pilot's bar. Swiping his ID through the slot he quickly stepped inside. The door slid down and he was encased in yellow plastic. For five seconds he felt incredibly compressed and then the door opened again to reveal the pilot's bar. As he walked out he scoped out Jurgen and made for the table. He noticed the other pilots sitting at their own tables quietly. So the radiation storm had claimed other comrades as well. It would be a sobering night. Ironic for where he was but he sat down and nodded in acknowledgement to Jurgen who passed him a Rheinland Lager. He stared moodily into the golden drink for awhile before looking up, grasping the mug and proclaiming &quot;To Heinz.&quot;
<br />&quot;To Heinz.&quot; mumered Jurgen in acknowledgement.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't follow any Religion because it's just like arguing over who's imaginary friend is better&quot;

<br />The green engines of the valkyrile squardon of Hans travelled slowly through the trade lane towards Dortmund and Essen station. After 10 minutes, A wingman finally broke the silence. &quot; Incoming LWB ships on long range scanners sir.&quot; Hans looked at the LWB ships on his scanners. &quot; Permission to engage?&quot; asked a wingman. Hans replied &quot; Fire at will&quot;. With that, the squardons' sleathblades started to rain on the LWB ships without mercy</div>

<br />
<br />Pedro sat down at the Leon Base bar and grunted.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tough day?&quot; The bartender asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;You bet. I just got transferred here from Crete, and Omega-41 isn't exactly a step up from Omicron Gamma. Gimme a beer.&quot;
<br />
<br />The bartender shrugged and slid him a beer. Suddenly, a console behind the bar started to beep. He turned around to attend to it. After a minute, he addressed the bar:
<br />
<br />&quot;Listen up, people. A patrol spotted a wing of Outcasts coming in from the Omicron Theta jump hole. They're closing on Leon fast. Get to your ships!&quot;
<br />
<br />Pedro never even got to take a sip of his beer before he was rushed towards the hangar. He grunted as he got into his Titan.
<br />
<br />A battlegroup consisting of eight Titans formed a box around Leon base, ready to defend from any side. After a few seconds, the Outcasts appeared on scanners.
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay,&quot; Pedro called out to the wing he commanded, &quot;They're coming in. Wait a minute... my scanner shows that their weapons aren't hot. Someone confirm this!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Red 8-2; roger, I show their weapons as powered down.&quot;
<br />
<br />Pedro stared at the Sabers as they approached. He was surprised to see them stop just out of the Corsairs' weapons range.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Outcasts Green 4-1 to Leon Base. Power down your weapons. We come in peace. I am transmitting a copy of the temporary treaty signed between the Outcast and Corsair leaders.&quot;
<br />
<br />After a few minutes of silence, the Leon Base communications operator spoke up, &quot;Roger. We had heard rumors of this, but didn't know for sure if it was true. Outcasts Green squadron, you are cleared to land. Corsairs Red Squadron, power down your weapons.&quot;
<br />
<br />Pedro stared blankly at the Outcasts in disbelief. &quot;Outcasts and Corsairs working together..... what the hell is going on?&quot;

<br />&quot;So, 500k for the cargo&quot;
<br />&quot;500k?What the hell is in there?&quot;
<br />&quot;The usual, Artifacts,Cardimane and something else.&quot;
<br />&quot;Whats that?&quot;
<br />&quot;Well, lets just say that Dublin is turning out to be an interesting system.&quot;
<br />&quot;What?&quot;
<br />&quot;All i will say is that i met a strange ship in Dublin, with an even stranger pilot.&quot;
<br />&quot;Hmmm, ok. Il upload the credits now&quot;
<br />Beep Beep
<br />&quot;All done, its been good doing business with you, Mr?&quot;
<br />&quot;Mr Black&quot;
<br />&quot;Ah rite, ok  then.
<br />
<br />&quot;That was a good deal, he got more than he bargined for though!&quot;
<br />
<br />News Report,
<br />&quot; And now for local news.&quot;
<br />&quot;There have been rumurs of a Corsair-Outcast alleince. This though has been denied by the Houses Governments. As they say, 'An alleince of this kind is just rubbish! The Outcasts and the Corsairs have been fighting for so long that no one remembers why! But one thing is certain, They wont stop fighting'   But this claim was shadowed today by the attack on installations within Bretonia by Corsair ships and Outcast ships, working together! We will keep you up to date on the events&quot;</div>

<br /><b>Location:  </b> Omicron Alpha
<br /><b>Credits:  </b> 1,000,000
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Outcast Trader Blue-4 requesting permission to land?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Outcast Trader Blue-4 this is Planet Malta what is you're cargo?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Planet Malta my cargo is Light Arms as ordered&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You're 5 hours late Magmus the deal is off!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You better open this gate before I blast it open... its hard enough flying from New York and back in a Freighter full of contraband with all theses Bounty Hunters around that I have to take this crap! Now open the gate!&quot;
<br />
<br />There was a moment of silence before the gate began to open...
<br />
<br />&quot;Permission granted... Try to make it on time next time... command out&quot;
<br />
<br />The engines of the Dromedary jumped into action and begun to manoeuvre the large ship down to the planets surface...
<br />
<br />The ship touched down and a Tech crew began to unload the Cargo, a Technician with a data pad approached Magmus as he exited his ship...
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah welcome back sir... i trust you had a safe trip?&quot;
<br />
<br />Magmus looked at the burn marks on his hull from weapons fire and small dents from missile hits...
<br />
<br />&quot;No more than usual... how much for the cargo?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok sure that&#8217;s 385,000 credits for the Cargo&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah fill her up with Cardamine again and I will get you guys some Engine Components you guys have been bugging me for&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sure thing that's 82,500 credits, shall I deduct it from the credits for the Light arms?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah... I'll be in the bar, contact me when you're done&quot;
<br />
<br />Magmus walked off the landing platform and towards his drink...
