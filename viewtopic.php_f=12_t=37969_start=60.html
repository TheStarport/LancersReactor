<br />
<br />BP's comments:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>What are you referring too, You don't make any sense. That is if you can stop your eyes from rolling around long enough...Wouldn't want you to get dizzy and bump your head now would we... Might even damage that mouth of yours.
<br />Now that would be a shame. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />To which you replied:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>would like to see you even TRY and follow through on that threat bp. just try and follow it through. i usually dont lower myself to this, but you're a ****ing sad sack of ****. there are days that i wonder if you are who you say you are, or if you even deserve to have a position of power. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I would like to see you intepret a sentence correctly instead. If you are dizzy - what usually happens? Try spinning around fast several times, and see what occurs. Do you get dizzy, and do you lose your balance slightly? I could tell you WHY you lose your balance exactly......if this was to be 'educational'. 
<br />
<br />So you lose your balance, and you stumble or fall. You hit your head........ Now if you fell face first you would most likely also include your mouth, along with nose, cheekbones and forehead. 
<br />
<br />Does it seem entirely possible that was what was being said? Now does your posts seem more than a little misplaced, and simply put - wrong? There is no threat there at all. How on earth you managed to find one I do not know.
<br />
<br />Resulting to personal insults when you are not even aware of whom you are talking about, or exactly what they are going through in life etc. For all you know Keiths mom could have just died, or his wife be in hospital - and yet he is not only coping with that, but also trying to keep this from getting over the top. 
<br />
<br />Complaints registered, if action will be taken, then it will be taken. Getting so low and dirty isn't going to change a damned thing, and having people dragging this out in the most personalised way possible is also not going to help.
<br />
<br />No doubt you still think your post has justification, but personally I would like to see that retracted. Yes I am aware that worse has happened between others, but since when do two wrongs make it okay? Since when does using someone elses experience justify yourself to cast aside any politeness or reasonability to deal whatever insult you see fit, without any care as to what the recipient feels?
<br />
<br />I personally think that the post signifies a whole series of events. You mis-read a post, or interpet it in any way you wish to, and then make a catestrophic post insulting someone as much as possible, with the single intent of causing hurt. Whats next? If you think whatever may have passed between others and any staff member justifies YOUR action, then it means there is justification AGAINST you too................ I am not saying that is going to/will happen at all - it won't, but if this is what we are dealing with here, when <b>will </b> it end? If we are dealing with people who are willing to escalate any situation into being 'on top' - what can we expect? Is someone going to hack the site next, to delete things out of spite or hatred?
<br />
<br />*shakes head*
<br />
<br />Its a sorry state, and although there maybe things that annoy or antagonise - its in no way an excuse for behaviour of this type either. I don't know what Keith is editing from posts, but I trust his judgement - as I <b>do </b> know him quite well, and I trust that it has been rightly censored as an un-necessary attack for no other means than to cause hurt or friction.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p357835" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">perhaps i should not get involved, and if i am reviving a dead horse, ignore me. i am not at the OT board as often as many of you, so this stands as an outsider's view for the most part:
<br />
<br />a lot of emotions have been thrown about on this board over the past few days, and i understand where it is comming from on both sides, i hope sleep has helped settle your feelings for the most part....
<br />
<br />it is sad to see that what has happened has driven away some very respected members of the community, i for one hope they return... 
<br />
<br />now, onto the more important thing, i have to agree with whoever said that &quot;the deletions and lockings have drawn more flaming than the topics themselves&quot; (sorry i dont remember your name) i understand that some of the things said have angered people on both sides, and i had a lot of respect for many of the people involved, until it fell into a war of who had the better insult... it is sad to see adults quarrel with teenagers, young ones at that, the mods have a tough job, a very tough one, especially when they get attacked, but they also have a certain integraty to uphold....
<br />
<br />perhaps the best way to deal with this is put a disclamer like you would with a spoiler... yes, it may look rediculous, but at least it sould keep posts a little more civilized, if something offends you, post why, give valid reasons, if someone flames you, respond resposibly, tell them why in more detail, and request their point of vew in more detail, dont flame them back, mearly ask them what angered them, if they continue to flame you, ignore them... yes this is easier said than done, but everyone here is mature... most of the time... the OT forum is the most popular forum on the entire site, vus face it, none of us live FL, we have real lives, or maybe it is because there are so many posts on this topic... some topics could be concidered taboo, but in my eyes, the main theme of all this trouble should not be sensored, put a disclaimer, whatever is needed, but dont pretend such matters dont exist, if this site is supposed to be a euporia, make another board called &quot;real life&quot; or whatever, where people can go and vent, and approach these heated topics civillt. Dont attack anyone, as i have tried not to do ( if anyone feels personally attacked, i apologise this was not my intention) you might be surprised as to what you might learn, no matter what the topic, if it can be approached in a non-violent way, people will earn their respect, as many have done so, and there will be those everyone ignores, and eventually will disappear
<br />
<br />well im sick (mono, its horrible dont get it) and ive forgotten whatever else it was i wanted to say, if you dont agree with something i have said, i ask you kindly to tell me why in a constructive manner, or ignore it completely, i hope this all gets resolved... without too much damage
<br />
<br />thank you
<br />
<br />
<br />as im sitting here, i dont know whether i should press post or not... as i do not want to stir up something that may have died down.... if it has died down please overlook this post
<br />
<br />edited becuase i should have proof read it, my appologies
