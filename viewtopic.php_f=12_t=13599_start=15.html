			<div class="content">Not bad.  This is one of my favorites, besides the one with the flies:
<br />
<br />A guy goes into a bar, and orders drink after drink.  He passes out, and when he wakes up he looks at his watch and realizes that it's three, A.M., and his wife is going to kill him.  He orders two bottles of Scotch to go, shoves them in his pockets, and dashes to his car.  
<br />
<br />After racing home as fast as he can, he opens the door, takes of his shoes, and tiptoes up the stairs so as not to wake anyone up.  Suddenly, he slips, falling all the way down on his [rear, shattering the two Scotch bottles in his back pockets.  His [rear is now seriously cut up, but he's so drunk that at first he doesn't even notice it.  When he reaches the top of the stairs, he sees the blood he's tracking everywhere, so he goes to the mirror and tries to mend the damage as best he can under the circumstances, then heads to bed.
<br />
<br />When he wakes up, his head is hurting, his [rear is still killing him, and his wife asks, &quot;you really got plastered last night, didn't you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, why do you ask?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, my first big clue came when I woke up and found nineteen band-aids stuck to the bathroom mirror.&quot;
<br />
<br />----------------------------
<br />
<br />But, if you want <i>tasteless </i>....
<br />
<br />A guy goes into a bar, and meets this really nice girl.  After a few drinks and the customary small-talk, they head back to his apartment for the night.
<br />
<br />So they're having a great time, and suddenly, she, on top of him, starts having a seizure.  She had neglected to tell him about her problem, so at first he thinks, &quot;Damn, this is the best sex I've ever had!&quot;  But when he finishes up, she's still flailing around, so he starts to get a little worried.  
<br />
<br />Finally, he takes her to the hospital.  When they arrive, the nurse inquires about the problem, to which he responds, &quot;er...I, uh...think her orgasm's stuck.&quot;
<br />
<br />Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not too sure about the former.
<br />
<br />-Albert Einstein

			<div class="content">A guy goes into a bar, and, for no apparent reason, gets involved in an argument with a woman in the corner over which of the major genders enjoys sex the most.  &quot;Why else would men talk about it all the time?&quot; he asks.
<br />The woman looks at him and says, &quot;That doesn't prove anything.  Think about this.  When you stick your finger in your ear, wiggle it around a little bit and pull it out, which feels better, your ear or your finger?&quot;

<br />A guy goes into a bar and sees an obviously drunk woman reading a book.  This seems a little odd to him, so he sends her a drink.  Without even glancing up, she continues to read.  He's really curious now, and sends her another drink, which she ignores.  Finally, he walks over and asks her why she ignored the beers.
<br />&quot;I'm sorry, I'm just engrossed in this book on male genitalia,&quot; she said.  &quot;Did you know that Navajo men have the fattest, widest penises?&quot; 
<br />The man shakes his head.
<br />&quot;Or that Mexican men have the longest?&quot;
<br />&quot;Nope, didn't know that, either.&quot;
<br />The woman puts down the book, and looks up saying, &quot;so what's your name, anyway?&quot;
<br />&quot;Tonto Rodriguez.&quot;

			<div class="content">Mastercard Wedding
<br />
<br />This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was in the local newspaper and even Jay Leno mentioned it. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and his family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception. As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope. He said this was his gift to veryone, and asked them to open their envelope. Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 glossy of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a private detective to tail them. After just standing there, just watching the guests' reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, &quot;F--- you!&quot;. Then he turned to his bride and said, &quot;F--- you!&quot; Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, &quot;I'm outta here.&quot; He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While most people would have cancelled the wedding immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong. His revenge...making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of 300 friends and family members. This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might get a MasterCard &quot;priceless&quot; commercial out of this? Elegant wedding reception for 300 family members and friends...$32,000. Wedding photographs commemorating the occasion...$3,000. Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui...$8,500. The look on everyone's face when they see the 8x10 glossy of the bride humping the best man...Priceless. There are some things money can't buy; for everything else there's MASTERCARD!!!

			<div class="content">A Fisherman's Tale  
<br />
<br />Two fellas are fishing in a boat under a bridge. One looks up and sees a funeral procession starting across the bridge. He stands up, takes off his cap, and bows his head. The procession crosses the bridge and the man puts on his cap, picks up his rod and reel, and continues fishing. 
<br />The other guy says, &quot;That was touching. I didn't know you had it in you.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The first guy responds, &quot;Well, I guess it was the thing to do - after all, I was married to her for 40 years.&quot;

<br />A Scottish tourist at his first baseball game...  
<br />
<br />A Scottish tourist attended his first baseball game in the US and after a base hit he hears the fans roaring &quot;Run....Run!&quot; 
<br />The next batter connects heavily with the ball and the Scotsman stands up and roars with the crowd in his thick accent: &quot;R-r-run ya bahstard, r-run will ya!&quot; 
<br />
<br />A third batter hits a slam and again the Scotsman, obviously pleased with his knowledge of the game, screams &quot;R-r-run ya bahstard, r-r-run will ya!&quot; 
<br />
<br />The next batter steadfastly holds his swing four times and as the ump calls a walk the Scotsman stands up and yells &quot;R-r-run ya bahstard, r-r-run!&quot; 
<br />
<br />All the surrounding fans giggle quietly and he sits down confused. A friendly fan, sensing his embarrassment, whispers to the Scotsman, &quot;He doesn't have to run, he's got four balls.&quot; 
<br />
<br />After this explanation the Scotsman stands up in disbelief and screams, &quot;Walk with pr-r-ride man! Walk with pr-r-ride!!!!&quot;

<br />Aggie Accident  
<br />
<br />There was an Aggie, Longhorn, and a Red Raider who were out hunting. The Aggie brought back a big buck. 
<br />''How did you get that?'' they all asked. 
<br />
<br />''I saw the tracks, followed the tracks, and ''boom'' I shot a buck.'' Then the longhorn brought back an elephant. 
<br />
<br />''How did you get that?&quot; they all asked. 
<br />
<br />''I saw the tracks, I followed the tracks, and ''boom'' I shot an elephant.'' Then the Red Raider came back all beat up. 
<br />
<br />&quot;What happened?&quot; they all asked. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I saw the tracks, I followed the tracks, and ''boom'' I got hit by a train.&quot; 
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Aggies R Dum  
<br />
<br />There was an Aggie, a Longhorn, and a Bug Eater. They attempted to rob a bank but got caught. They went to court and were sentenced to the electric chair. The guys operating it told them that if they survived they were free to go. 
<br />The Longhorn went first. They asked him if he had any last words to say. He told them no. He pressed the button and nothing happened so he was free to go. 
<br />
<br />The bug eater went next. They asked him if he had any last words to say. He said no and pressed the button. Nothing happened and he was free to go. 
<br />
<br />The Aggie went next. They asked him if he had any last words. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I think if you plug the chair in, it'll work better.&quot;

			<div class="content">New Improved Lawnmowers  
<br />
<br />One day a lawyer was riding in his limosine when he saw a guy eating grass He told the driver to stop. He got out and asked him, &quot;Why are you eating grass&quot;. 
<br />The man replied, &quot;I'm so poor, I can't afford a thing to eat.&quot; 
<br />
<br />So the layer said, &quot;Poor guy, come back to my house.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The guys then said, &quot;But I have a wife and three kids.&quot; The layers told him to bring them along. 
<br />
<br />When they were all in the car, the poor man said, &quot;Thanks for taking us back to your house, it is so kind of you.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The layer said, &quot;You're going to love it there, the grass is a foot tall.&quot; 
<br />

<br />A Few Good Lawyers  
<br />
<br />A lawyer is standing in a long line at the box office. Suddenly, he feels a pair of hands kneading his shoulders, back, and neck. The lawyer turns around. 
<br />&quot;What the hell do you think you're doing?&quot; 
<br />&quot;I'm a chiropractor, and I'm just keeping in practice while I'm waiting in line.&quot; 
<br />&quot;Well, I'm a lawyer, but you don't see me screwing the guy in front of me, do you?&quot;  
<br />_____________________________________________________________
<br />
<br />Beautiful?  
<br />
<br />There was a lawyer and he was just waking up from anesthesia after surgery, and his wife was sitting by his side. His eyes fluttered open and he said, &#8220;You're beautiful!&#8221; and then he fell asleep again. His wife had never heard him say that so she stayed by his side. A couple minutes later his eyes fluttered open and he said &#8220;You're cute!&#8221; Well, the wife was dissapointed because instead of &#8220;beautiful&#8221; it was &#8220;cute.&#8221; She said &#8220;What happened to &#8216;beautiful&#8217;? His reply was &#8220;The drugs are wearing off!&#8221;  
<br />

<br />Blind Bunny, Meet Blind Snake  
<br />
<br />One morning a blind bunny was hopping down the bunny trail, and he tripped over a large snake and fell, KerPlop!, right on his twitchy little nose. &quot;Oh, please excuse me!&quot; said the bunny.  &quot;I didn't mean to trip over you, but I'm blind and can't see.&quot;
<br />
<br />    &quot;That's perfectly all right,&quot; replied the snake.  &quot;To be sure, it was my fault.   I didn't mean to trip you, but I'm blind too, and I didn't see you coming.  By the way, what kind of animal are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />    &quot;Well, I really don't know,&quot; said the bunny.  &quot;I'm blind, and I've never seen myself.  Maybe you could examine me and find out.&quot;
<br />
<br />    So the snake felt the bunny all over, and he said, &quot;Well, you're soft, and cuddly, and you have long silky ears, and a little fluffy tail and a dear twitchy little nose... You must be a bunny rabbit!&quot;
<br />
<br />    Then he said, &quot;I can't thank you enough, but by the way, what kind of animal are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />    And the snake replied that he didn't know, and the bunny agreed to examine him, and when he was finished, the snake said, &quot;Well, what kind of an animal am I?&quot;
<br />
<br />    So the bunny felt the snake all over, and he replied, &quot;You're hard, you're cold, you're slimy and you haven't got any balls... You must be a lawyer.&quot;</div>
