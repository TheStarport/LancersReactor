			<div class="content">Here's my fan fiction, set before the Freelancer Storyline, in conjunction with my MOD:
<br />
<br />Location: Europa, Jupiter
<br />Time: Unknown
<br />
<br />Here I am, ready to be frozen like the food here, and shipped like it too. This whole 'sleeper ship' idea creeps me out, as if the Alliance is escaping from its present turmoils. We haven't been told where we are going, only that we are going to 'a better place', a 'free world'.
<br />
<br />The Coalition has destroyed most of our remaining bases across Solar, basically nullifying our chance of an effective resistance.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I've gotta go, my pod is ready.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: The Hispania, Unknown, Somewhere in Space
<br />Time: Unknown
<br />
<br />&quot;Colonel Gonzalez,&quot; I heard. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;
<br />I looked up, and saw an old battle friend of mine, a fellow Colonel, Gregorio Sanchez.
<br />
<br />&quot;Just five more minutes please&quot;, I joked. &quot;Just kidding, what's the matter?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We've been attacked&quot;, he cried. &quot;We don't know who, yet!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;By what?&quot;, I replied. &quot;We're in the middle of nowhere, I'm guessing, so how could we have been attacked?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I do not know, we are currently investigating this situation&quot;, he replied in earnest. &quot;The Admiral wants you on the bridge as soon as possible!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm ready, just need some fresh air!&quot; I said as I reached for my oxygen tube.
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's go then&quot;, he replied.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Bridge of the Hispania, still Unknown
<br />Time: Unknown
<br />
<br />&quot;Colonel Gonzalez, how was your sleep?&quot; Admiral Frederico Hierro asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Not bad,&quot; I said. &quot;What's the situation?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We've been attacked, from the inside, by who we are assuming is a Coalition saboteur&quot;, he replied. &quot;But she is refusing to talk.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;SHE?&quot; I asked. &quot;Why would a woman do this?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We don't know, and we don't want to know&quot;, he cried. &quot;All we know is that she is in a cell, waiting for your questioning.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;My questioning? But why do ...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No but's!&quot; the Admiral interrupted. &quot;This is your assignment, and we can't spare anybody else on this, you are the best for the job. Remember back in...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes I do, sir&quot;, I interrupted. I was not proud of my previous deeds, as many of them were far short of honorable.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hop to it,&quot; the Admiral ordered in a stern tone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, sir&quot;, I replied. I saluted, and headed to the detention quarters of this eerie ship, escorted by Sanchez and a dark tall man who was silent all the way.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Detention Cell, Level 3, Hispania
<br />Time: I have been informed it is now 23 days since we left Europa
<br />
<br />&quot;So, what is your name?&quot; I asked the young Russian blonde, but there was no reply.
<br />
<br />&quot;We know you are Russian, and were working for the Coalition. Why did you do it?&quot; I aked in a harsher voice this time. Again, no reply.
<br />
<br />&quot;Guards, leave please,&quot; I ordered, but they simply looked at each other, and mumbled.
<br />
<br />&quot;NOW!&quot; I commanded, which made them jump, and of course, made them move!
<br />
<br />Once they had left, I was able to resort to my usual tactics in questioning, involving deceit.
<br />
<br />&quot;I am a Colonel in the Hispania Fleet,&quot; I told her after a few moments silence. &quot;My name is Enrique Gonzalez. I have two children, seven years old, and four years old, both 'asleep' on this ship, deep in slumber. But their mother, my wife, was killed by the blast from YOUR bomb.&quot;
<br />
<br />My eyes began to well up, and I reached for the handkerchief in my pocket. After wiping my eyes, I looked up at the young Russian, whose expression had changed from one of pride, to one of sorrow.
<br />
<br />&quot;I am a Recruit in the Coalition Assault Group,&quot; she replied. &quot;I am twenty-three years old, have no husband, no children, and no family. This was meant to be a suicide mission for me. I was forced to take this mission.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You were forced?&quot; I asked, puzzled. No reply.
<br />
<br />&quot;Why did you attack us here?&quot; I inquired.
<br />
<br />&quot;I was forced, because, because nobody else would,&quot; she replied. &quot;I hoped maybe I could also start anew, with you and your people...&quot;
<br />
<br />At that moment she started sobbing. I am a soppy git, and hence handed her my handkerchief. She took it, and thanked me for it.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: My Quarters, Level 4, Hispania
<br />Time: 25 days after the escape from Europa
<br />
<br />I have finally got some information out of the Russian woman. The bomb was a small EMP blast, rendering anything within 25 metres of the blast dead. And what's worse, it was set off in the Jump Drive section of the ship, so basically we're lost in space, drifting at impulse speed, or the speed of sound.
<br />
<br />We are drifting to an unexplored section of space, only previously seen from long-range telescopes back on Earth. But that was a long time ago, ooh.. over two centuries now.
<br />
<br />The Russian woman has been moved out of Detention into a more comfortable dwelling, only three crew 'cells' away from mine. She was, she claims, forced into doing this mission, and hence had no choice in the matter. The device that was set off was set when she arrived on board, and all she had to do was stay hidden from the Alliance commanders so that she was not found, and neither was the device.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Mess Hall, Level 1, Hispania
<br />Time: 43 days since the flee from Europa
<br />
<br />I have now become 'friends', as she puts it, with the Russian woman, and am currently eating a meal with her now.
<br />
<br />There are very few people awake on this 'ship', or 'slug' as it's become to be known, as the majority of my race are 'asleep' on the ship.
<br />
<br />I do not have any children, nor did I have a wife, but my tactics were sound, and hit home. I regret saying these things, but it's too late to change them now.
<br />
<br />Myself and the Russian woman have been assigned new, separate pods in which we will 'sleep' out the rest of this trek across the galaxy...
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Unknown
<br />Time: Unknown
<br />
<br />We have finally come within scanner range of 'our new home'! Scanners have detected a hospitable planet within 3 million kilometers, so that is our new target. Ship engineers have predicted that killing our engines as we approach will slow us down enough to drift towards the planet, and hence we should be within visual range if and when we get there.
<br />
<br />The Admiral, once a young-ish, avid member of the Hispania Fleet, has died whilst we have been 'asleep', and hence I have been chosen to take his place.
<br />
<br />Now Admiral Enrique Gonzalez, sounds good don't it?, I have been chosen to lead my people (I sound like Moses!) to a 'promised land', but of course, my Vice Admiral will do the commanding, and I will do the sleeping.
<br />
<br />Co-ordinates have been set for the Hispania Sleeper Slug, as has come to be it's name, computers have been set to kill the engines approximately 2,500 KM from our 'new home', and hence we can now all rest sound.

			<h3><a href="#p248489" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Location: Unkown
<br />Time: Unknown
<br />
<br />There was a big crash, and a crunch, as we drifted through an asteroid field. Computers are down, and scanners are barely functioning, so it's more like hit and miss to get to our 'new home' now.
<br />
<br />I was awoken by Lieutenant Polina Baranova, the Russian woman, who had since been awoken and, because of her exceptional navigational skills, has been appointed as Deputy Navigator for the Hispania Sleeper Slug.
<br />
<br />We have reached visual range of the planet, and our scanners have detected that there are oceans, grass, and an oxygen atmosphere.
<br />
<br />Now, drifting at half impulse speed, we are now within 5,000 KM of our new home. Rumours have been floating around of a new name: Malta.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: In orbit around 'Kahlmera', the moon of 'Malta'
<br />Time: Timing methods indicate it has been over 150 years since we left Europa
<br />
<br />We are now in orbit around Planet 'Malta', and survey teams have been dispatched to locate the best site of our new start.
<br />
<br />Lieutenant Baranova and I are now 'dating', so to speak, not that there is anywhere to go! She is beautiful, and now, at 39 years old, has gotten older than me! I am now 34 years old, having been 29 years old when we left Europa. It confuses me as well! So basically I've been awake for 5 years, and Polina has been awake for 16 years!
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Hispania Sleeper Slug, in orbit around Kahlmera
<br />Time: 13 days since we arrived here
<br />
<br />The elders of the two nations aboard this ship are in hot dispute at the moment. The elders of the Latin American population are dissatisfied with the 'new home', saying that it is unsuitable to meet everybody's needs.
<br />
<br />Whereas the elders of the Spanish population say that it IS suitable for the needs of the population on board the ship.
<br />
<br />Elder Roberto Figo of Latin America says that he wants to take three of the four 'lifeboats' attached to the Hispania, and go in pursuit of a more suitable territory for &quot;his people&quot;.
<br />
<br />Whereas Elder Eduardo Urielo of Spain refuses to let them take the lifeboats, and is, in effect, attempting to order them to stay.
<br />
<br />This is where I intervened. I told both parties that they must decide, as a people, what they want to do.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Hispania, in oribit around Kahlmera
<br />Time: 16 days since we arrived here
<br />
<br />The results were unanimous! The Latin Americans have decided to leave the Hispania, in pursuit of better land.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, the Spanish, along with myself, want to stay. The Latin Americans have dispatched, and are, well, saying goodbye from outside!
<br />
<br />&quot;Adios, my comrades,&quot; the Captain of Lifeboat Uno said.
<br />
<br />&quot;We will miss you&quot;, laughed the Captain of Lifeboat Dos.
<br />
<br />&quot;Come on, we've got a lot ahead of us&quot;, said Elder Roberto Figo, who had appointed himself Captain of the third Lifeboat.
<br />
<br />So off they went, far into the distance. The lifeboats 'jumped out', and headed for a nebula, in which was a gravitational anomaly. Too far for our small fighters, the people of Spain decided to stay on board, rather that act as escorts.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Camp Madrid, Malta
<br />Time: Just after sunrise, three days after arriving here
<br />
<br />The air here is hot and heavy. Our survey teams have established that Planet Malta is in orbit around a Red Dwarf, with a small moon, Kahlmera, orbiting us, generating the tides of the acidic oceans.
<br />
<br />Radio contact with the Latino Lifeboats had long since been lost. Supposedly they travelled through some kind of Wormhole, but never returned.
<br />
<br />The few crew left on the Hispania Sleeper Ship have decided to use what's left of the ship and it's engines to build a small lifeboat, capable of supporting life, in order to establish what else is in our star system.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: My tent, Camp Madrid, Malta
<br />Time: 3 months after arriving here
<br />
<br />Our star system has now been as fully explored as it can be. In our system there are six heavenly bodies: The Sun, Planet Malta, Kahlmera (our moon), a gas giant, a moon orbiting the gas giant, and a lush green world hidden in a nebula. The gas giant, it's moon, and the lush green world in the nebula are yet to be named, but they is not on our top list of priorities at the moment.
<br />
<br />Surveys conducted on this planet have revealed a startling discovery. There is very fertile soil here, but it is nearly all occupied by a tall, thin, and orange grass, which has been dubbed cardamine pretensis, meaning 'cuckoo flower'. Our survey teams have found that this grass can be rendered into a 'drug', but it is still doubted.
<br />
<br />Many have tried to eat the grass, as a compensatory factor for the immense hunger that is filling the camps on the planets, but to no avail, it has caused sickness, diahroea, and in some extreme cases death by dehydration. The ship's rations are running low, and we are running out of ideas.
<br />
<br />In a last ditch attempt, we have decided to arrange for a group of volunteers to see if they can survive solely on this 'drug'.
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Camp Madrid
<br />Time: 14 months since we arrived here
<br />
<br />Polina has become pregnant since my last recording, and has given birth to twins, a boy and a girl, who we have called Gregorio, after my good friend, and Rosa, after Polina's mother.
<br />
<br />The results of the Cardamine experiment were astounding! The test subjects survuved on no food, no water, just solely on this 'drug'! Scientists are baffled, and teams of them are trying to discover why!
<br />
<br />
<br />Location: Camp Madrid, Planet Malta
<br />Time: 13 years, 3 months, and 22 days since we arrived here
<br />
<br />This drug is amazing. For over 10 years we have survived on just this drug, and are now addicted to it. My children are growing up, and are now working in many of the Cardamine fields.
<br />
<br />There is no government here, just everybody 'rules themselves', as Polina put it, and we are happier this way than we ever were back on Earth. We have to work in the Cardamine fields, gathering our daily supplies, as, in the immense heat of this planet, the Cardamine shrivels up very easily if left out for more than a day or two at most.
