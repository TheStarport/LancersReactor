			<div class="content">&#8220;Green five, six, and seven, circle starboard and draw their fire&#8221; topher said, lining up his weapons on the bridge. He and four ships locked on with every thing the had. The resulting explosion warmed them and they were rewarded with shouts over the com channel. They were winning this battle. All remaining ships headed toward two star destroyers that were attempting to flee. At that moment, two bulwark battle cruiser dropped out of hyper space directly in their paths. With no alternative, they opened fire. But it was to no avail. The fire power over whelmed them and soon, all that was seen was scrap metal. The barges would have their hands full recovering the materials.
<br />
<br />At that moment, a lone X-Wing dropped out of hyper space and headed directly to the planet. It was headed to a meeting that would bake this battle seem small in comparison. The pilot, Darkstone, knew the enemy and knew she was here. He knew where she was going and what awaited him. This was a battle that he must win, for the sake of both of them, he had to win.
<br />
<br />The force seemed to be leading him to the family estate in the north. He headed down, hugging the surface. He did not know what to expect, or who for that matter. His wake he created as he skimmed a scant meter off the surface, sprayed high into the air. The mist creating a rainbow. As he neared the shore, he saw the shuttle craft sitting on part of the landing pad. He had been right. He set her down and shut down. &#8220;R2, you stay with the ship&#8221; Darkstone spoke. Bleeep, whistle, beep came the reply. &#8220; I mean it, no matter what, you stay here.&#8221; A Bleep came back in acknowledgment. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone changed out of his flight suit and into his Jedi robes. He wanted full freedom for what lay ahead. He moved on the family grave plot. To where his father and Aunt were buried. He stared at it as he knelt. Closing his eyes, he sought the meditation level that had become apart of his life. A peace settled over him. He found the level he sought. Then he felt it. Dark energy approaching, ever nearer. 
<br />
<br />His blade was in his hand and held over his head. The blow was blocked and he pushed away and rolled to a standing position. He was face to face with Carla, or now, Darth sycho_warrior. Both held their blades at the ready. 
<br />
<br />The dark one stood staring, staring into the face of her enemy. Yet, it was a familiar face. One she could not put a name to. She just knew it was one she must destroy for her plans to move forward. After all, she had killed Jedi before, what&#8217;s one more to her. She drew her blade back and began to advance. Parrying, thrusting. She tried from the right and then from the left. Each was met with strength and determination. She had to find an opening. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone countered her every move, but it was tiring him. He had to mask that fact though. He had to get her disarmed and then he could talk to her. There was no time now though, it would only distract him. He saw an opening and executed a side kick that sent her tumbling. She caught her self and regained her footing. There was surprise on her face now. This was unexpected. Darkstone then began a different tactic. He maneuvered them around toward the deck area that over looked the lake. He parred and thrust and was able to executed another side kick. He would not be able to do a third.
<br />
<br />Darth sycho_warrior was slower getting up this time. But her eyes flashed fire. Her anger grew. She brought her saber around in a circle from lower to upper. She tried to get under his but failed. She did knock him back a step. She repeated the move coming down this time. This one deflected his blow. He was vulnerable, but only for a second. He leapt back and away. He landed three meters away and came again to the ready stance. The dark one advanced again. Striking downward on Darkstone&#8217;s blade. He focused a second and shoved he back. Saber left her hand and dropped to the ground as she tumbled towards the water. 
<br />
<br />She extended her hand and the saber was once again in it and lit. This time, Darkstone did a persuade move. She faltered, but only for a second. She resumed her lightning thrusts and parries. She had to get the upper hand. She was tiring and did not want to let him know it. She despised weakness. She had to beat this man, she could not fail, would not let herself fail. A flash of insight and she faltered. Her blow missed it&#8217;s mark and she cut a mall shrub into. Who was this man? Who is he? She swung again, this time one the mark.
<br />
<br />Darkstone was forced to give a step, but he again countered and attempted the persuade move. He had to reach her mind, to reach her. He had to get past the darkside training she had been given. He knew now that she had indeed been trained. She was too good to have learned on her own. He would not give up until he reached her. 
<br />
<br />He knew what he had to do. He focused on the force. He focused on the point, he focused on her. She backed to change direction when Darkstone switched off his saber and clipped it to his belt. She could not believe he was that foolish. She again brought the blade to bear. But stopped inches from Darkstone. She could not will the blade any further. She attempted to withdraw the blade, but could not do that either. She looked into his eyes. Fife bright as the noon day sun over head flashed. In it she saw unlimited power. Power that was greater than what she had. The saber was torn from her grasp.
<br />
<br />It moved hilt first into Darkstone&#8217;s hand. She believed she would now die, weaponless. But, to her amazement, he switched it off and clipped it to his belt as well. He reached for her, reached passed her upraised hands, paste her defenses. He held his hand in front of her. She felt light headed. She felt herself rise from the ground and move. She was moved to the deck. Was he going to drown her? She could only watch, her power was drained. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone set her down on the deck, beside a bench. He released her from the hold. Her eyes were clear, pure. &#8220;Carla, please, sit&#8221; he spoke and indicated the bench. He sat beside her and spoke in soothing tones, calming her fears. &#8220;My name is Darkstone, darkstone Skywalker, your cousin&#8221;. He let this sink in. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;My cousin, I have no cousin, no family&#8221; she replied. 
<br />
<br />That is what he told you&#8221; Darkstone responded, &#8220;He lied to you to corrupt you&#8221; he spoke to her heart. Her expression was one of confusion. &#8220;The one who trained you, he corrupted you to the darkside.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But, I trained myself, I left....the....Jedi order...I can&#8217;t remember when, it is so fussy, I can&#8217;t remember&#8221;. She looked sad, as if she lost something valuable, something she had longed for. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain all that I can, but first, there is some one you need to meet.&#8221; He said. He pulled a com link from his robe and clicked it. Within a moment an old man came walking up. But, when he saw the young woman, he tired eyes lit up. As if new life returned to tired bones. He could not believe his eyes. &#8220;Carla&#8221; darkstone began, &#8220;This is Han Solo, you father&#8221;. He got no farther. She shook her head.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, my parents are dead, Master Luke raised me&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your mother, afraid of the force level in you asked if my father would raise you&#8221; Darkstone answered, &#8220;He agreed to and together they said that you had died, so you could learn in private and would not be targets of those who sought revenge on Han and all the family&#8221;. He told her more, of all that she was, of all that was in her family back ground, of Anakin Skywalker and his turn to the darkside and then his turn back to the light.
<br />
<br />&#8220;But there is another, one who I was teaching&#8221;she searched her mind for a name, &#8220;neo.....Neo_kuja, I think.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, I know, he has been defeated as well.&#8221; Darkstone said, looking away. He had not realized how close he had come to wanting to kill her too. He turned and told her all that he knew, all that he had faced getting to here, including originally wanting to kill her. But, he now shared his love for her, for family. She was his only family left now. He would get her to meet his wife one day, soon.
<br />
<br />Han moved closer, slowly as he would to a deer that would flee. He reached out to her. She stood and he took her in his arms and held her close to him. He never wanted to lose her again. He looked at Darkstone as he held her and mouthed the words &#8217;Thank You&#8217;.
