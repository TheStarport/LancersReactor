<br />
<br />
<br />I just finished my last mission with juni i was told to get a job, with 14,000 credits left and 6 shield batteries with 2 nanobots....i needed one. I found this trader on manhatten who was selling some real cheap goods cant remember wat they were but planet tokyo was buying for almost triple the price, practically gaining 1,000 for evry1 sold!!!!!! I filled my cargo bay to the max, 70 units i fitted. soon as i bought the goods and they were loaded i plotted the best course to tokyo, 32 waypoints i think, i launched my ship, i dont know why but the anubis fighter looks so good when taking off but as much as i loved it i knew i wud have to sell it and buy a better ship to fit my requirements. and so, the journey to tokyo began.............

<br />
<br />I was on my way to tokyo, so far no enemy ships met apart from a little skirmish between the police and a few rouges while i was exiting new york, into the cvalifornia system (I havent discovered the galileo system yet) and no attacks yet, i was feeling like this was my lucky day, no enemy ships and a cargo thats worth lots at tokyo, but it was too early to start feeling lucky.........
<br />
<br />There i was going through trade lane after trade lane, jump gate after jump gate with no resistance when suddenly i run into some enemy ships in tau 29, 6 outcasts 4 with dagger ships and 2 with stillettos, i started to worry.
<br />
<br />Four of the ships were on my 12 while the other 2 were attacking some poor trader on the verge of a hull breach, less than 5 seconds later, his ship was gone and there were no more friendly ships on my rader, i realised....i was alone. I locked onto a ship that was about 1500km to my 9, i come about and opened fire within seconds his shields were down but i took some damage on my six after a tense fight i finally blew his ship outta the stars and tractored wat he had left before his ship was in bits, 5 left and i lost a very little bit of shield thanx to the batteries, i needed something to tip the balance a little so i flew into the asteroid field for cover dropping mines while they fired, i managed to take out 1 of their ships shield and finished him off but there was still 1 stiletto and 3 daggers left.
<br />
<br />Off i went to get the stiletto, i damaged most of its hull and it started up its cruise engines, i made sure he didnt make it so i launched a cruise missile (As i like to call them) his engines went down, i flew in to intercept, his hull was down and his engines were starting up again, i launched a missile......the missile weaved in and out of the asteroids when finally hittin, he will not be missed but it was no time to celebrate. 5 minutes later and 1 dagger was left, he didnt have a chance, he was almost on a hull breach with fire coming from its engines in hot pursuit of me and i launched a mine.........................he was gone.
<br />
<br />4km to the closest trade lane and next waypoint, after going throught the second ring the trade lane was distrupted and i was asked to drop my cargo, i was not in the mood to fight, but the other ships were, i politely declined dropping my cargo and headed for the ring, it was still down and i wudnt make it to the next ring, i flew staright int otheir formation then did a u turn, the lane was up but my shields were down with 1km to the trade lane, i was trying to dodge every shot but didnt manage, 100m to the trade lane i  didnt know wat to do, on the verge of a hull breach with no nanobots and 1 shield which wudnt do any good so.......i stopped my engines and the formation flew past me i afterburned to the trade lane as they came about and just made it.
<br />
<br />Fortunately nago station was at the end of the trade lane so i stopped for some repairs and rest. But within no time i was back on the road (well....space) i ran into no more enemys all the way to tokyo. 1 trade lane away from the planet and i was getting excited, the credits will come in handy towards my new ship im saving up for, i made it to the planet and requested landing permission and landed asap, i met up with the trader and he kindly gave me the money, if only he knew wat i went through to get here.
<br />
<br />Thanx for reading.
