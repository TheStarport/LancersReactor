			<div class="content">Aliens in Texas
<br />
<br />Two aliens landed in the West Texas desert near an abandoned gas station.
<br />They approached one of the gas pumps, and one of the aliens addressed it.
<br />Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.The gas
<br />pump, of course, didn't respond.
<br />
<br />The alien repeated the greeting. There was no response. The alien, annoyed
<br />by what he perceived to be the gas pump's haughty attitude, drew his ray
<br />gun, and said impatiently, Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. How dare
<br />you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader, or I'll fire!
<br />
<br />The other alien shouted to his comrade No, you don't want to make him mad!
<br />But before he finished his warning, the first alien fired. There was a huge
<br />explosion that blew both of them 1200 feet into the desert, where they
<br />landed in a heap.
<br />
<br />When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the
<br />other one and said, What a ferocious creature. It damn near killed us! How
<br />did you know it was so dangerous? The other alien answered,If there's one
<br />thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy ... any guy who can wrap his penis around himself twice and then stick it in his own ear, is someone you shouldn't mess with.

			<div class="content">One morning recently
<br />A young woman
<br />Got out of bed
<br />Slipped into her robe
<br />Raised the blinds
<br />Uncovered the parrot
<br />Put on the coffee pot
<br />Answered the phone
<br />And heard a masculine voice say:
<br />&quot;Hello, honey. My flight just arrived
<br />And i'm coming right over.&quot;
<br />So the young lady
<br />Took the coffee pot of the stove
<br />Covered the parot
<br />Lowered the blinds
<br />Took off her robe
<br />Got into bed
<br />And heard the parrot mumble,

<br />Which means I have to give credit to Miles Allerien
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Theorem: Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business executives. 
<br />
<br />Now we have a mathematical proof that explains why this is true: 
<br />
<br />Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power. 
<br />Postulate 2: Time is Money. 
<br />
<br />As every engineer knows, 
<br />Work 
<br />------ = Power 
<br />Time 
<br />
<br />Since Knowledge = Power, and Time = Money, we have: 
<br />Work 
<br />------- = Knowledge 
<br />Money 
<br />
<br />Solving for Money, we get: 
<br />Work 
<br />------------ = Money 
<br />Knowledge 
<br />
<br />Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity regardless of the amount of Work done. 
<br />
<br />Conclusion: The Less you Know, the More you Make. 
<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Another one from Miles Allerien:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />Proof that Women are Inherently Evil 
<br />
<br />Women require both money and time: women = money * time 
<br />
<br />Since Time is money: women = money * money 
<br />
<br />To condense this: women = money^2 
<br />
<br />Now, money is the root of all evil, so: women = (Root(all evil))^2 
<br />
<br />Square Root and Square cancel: women = all evil 
<br />
<br />Definition: Women are all evil. 
<br />   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Not that that's true, of course <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Three guys are sitting on a park bench.  The first guy pulls out a hypodermic needle and shoots himself full of heroin.  He gives the needle to the second guy and he shoots himself full of heroin.  The second guy gives the needle to the third guy and he shoots himself full of heroin.  A man walks by and watches these three guys for a minute or two.  He says, &quot;hey, aren't you worried about getting AIDS?&quot;  One of the guys on the bench says, &quot;no way.  We have condoms on.&quot;
<br />
<br />A kid didn't have a bathroom in his house, so when he had to go he went across the street and went to the bathroom in an alley behind a building.  Of course the guy who owned the building didn't like this so he told the kid the next time he caught him he'd turn him in.  One day the kid had to go really bad and finally he decided he had to take the chance and go in the alley.  He went and relieved himself and was about to leave when he heard footsteps coming from around the corner.  He looked around and saw a coffee can so he put it over the evidence right before the guy who owned the building caught him.  The guy said, &quot;what are you doing back here?  Have you been going to the bathroom in my alley?&quot;  The kid said, &quot;no sir.  You told me I can't do that anymore.&quot;  The guy said, &quot;well, what do you have under that coffee can?&quot;  The kid said, &quot;oh, my leprechaun is under there.&quot;  The guy said, &quot;I don't believe you.  Let me see him.&quot;  The kid said, &quot;no.  He scares real easily, so I can't show you.&quot;  The guy said, &quot;oh yeah!&quot;  Then he grabbed the coffee can and yanked it away.  The kid yelled, &quot;what are you doing?!  You squeezed the crap out of my leprechaun!!&quot;
<br />
<br />On the first day of school the first-grade teacher tells the kids they have to stop talking in baby talk.  She says, &quot;Billy, what did you do over the summer?&quot;  Billy says, &quot;I went to visit my nana.&quot;  The teacher says, &quot;you're using baby-talk, Billy.  Who did you visit?&quot;  Billy says, &quot;I visited my grandma.&quot;  The teacher says, &quot;Sally, what did you do over the summer?&quot;  Sally says, &quot;I got to take a ride on a choo choo.&quot;  The teacher says, &quot;you're using baby-talk, Sally.  What did you ride on?&quot;  Sally says, &quot;I rode on a train.&quot;  The teacher says, &quot;Bobby, what did you do over the summer?&quot;  Bobby says, &quot;I read a book.&quot;  The teacher says, &quot;what was the name of the book?&quot;  Bobby says, &quot;Winnie the s***.&quot;

<br />
<br />A couple goes to an art gallery. They find a picture of a naked women with only her privates covered with leaves. The wife doesn't like it and moves on but the huband keeps looking. The wife asks, &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; The husband replies, &quot;Autumn.&quot;

<br />Baby Talk 
<br />
<br />Little Johnny came running into the house and asked, &quot;Mommy, can little girls have babies?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said his mom, &quot;Of course not.&quot; Little Johnny then ran back outside and his mom heard him yell to his friends, &quot;It's okay, we can play that game again
<br />
<br />All I Want Is a Beer! 
<br />
<br />A man was out of town on business. While sitting around his hotel he became bored. So he thought to himself, &quot;Hmm, a beer would be really nice right now.&quot; So he began to wander the streets of the unfamiliar city, looking for a bar. And, after a few minutes he came across one. He casually went inside and took a seat at the bar. The bartender walks up and asks the man what he is drinking. Anxiously, the man says, &quot;Bud Light please.&quot; The bartender then asked what the name of his penis was. The man looked at him with confusion and said, &quot;What are you talking about? All I want is a Bud Light and, besides, I have no name for my penis.&quot; The bartender, calming the man, said, &quot;Look around, all you see is men. That is because this is a gay bar. And the tradition is, when you order a drink, you state the name of your penis. Then I'll serve you a drink.&quot; The man, really thirsty for a beer, now says, &quot;Fine. Give me couple of minutes to think, and I'll order when I come up with something.&quot; So he is thinking about it for a couple of minutes and still can't come up with anything. So he decides to ask the guy next to him for an idea. The man states, in a feminine voice, &quot;Well I call mine Timex, because it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin.&quot; The man quickly turns away and asks another man to his right. That man states in a deep, gruff voice, &quot;I call my Ford, because it is built ram tough. Have you driven a Ford lately?&quot; Again, the man quickly turns away. Then, suddenly he says, &quot;Bartender, come here, I am ready to order.&quot; The bartender says, &quot;What'll ya have?&quot; The man says, &quot;A Bud Light please.&quot; The bartender asks, &quot;What is the name of your penis?&quot; The man responds, &quot;Secret... strong enough for a man but made for a woman</div>

			<div class="content">Around christmas time last year I was walking into a shoping center and I saw this young boy sobbing away in a corner while pathetically clutching a wrinkled $50 note. 
<br />
<br />I went over to comfort the lad and ask him what was wrong. He said that his mother had given him two $50 bills to buy christmas presents for the entire family, this would be the first time in two years that there would be christmas presents under the tree as they were very poor.
<br />Sadly for the boy, some older kids had seen him with this much money and had bundled him up in a corner, fortunately he had managed to escape and they were only able to take half his money.
<br />
<br />I asked him &quot;didn't you yell for help?&quot; He nodded while holding back the tears. I asked him how loud did he yell, he gave a little yell &quot;heeellllpp....&quot;.
<br />I realised no-one would have been able to hear that patheitic little whimper, so I grabbed the other $50 and legged it out of there.</div>

<br />A yuppie opened the door of his BMW, when suddenly a car came along and hit the door, ripping it off completely. When the police arrived at the scene, the yuppie was complaining bitterly about the damage to his precious BMW. 
<br />&quot;Officer, look what they've done to my Beemer!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;You yuppies are so materialistic, you make me sick!&quot; retorted the officer. &quot;You're so worried about your stupid BMW, that you didn't even notice that your left arm was ripped off!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; screamed the yuppie, noticing the bloody stump where his arm used to be. &quot;My Rolex!&quot;

<br />Fairy Tale For Our Times  
<br />
<br />A Fairy Tale for the Woman of the New Millennium:
<br />
<br />Once upon a time, in a land far away, a beautiful, independent, self-assured princess happened upon a frog as she sat contemplating ecological issues on the shores of an unpolluted pond in a verdant meadow near her castle.The frog hopped into the Princess' lap. 
<br />&quot;Elegant Lady, I was once a handsome Prince, until an evil witch cast a spell upon me. One kiss from you, however, and I will turn back into the dapper, young Prince that I am! Then, my sweet, we can marry and set up housekeeping in yon castle with my Mother, where you can prepare my meals, clean my clothes, bear my children, and forever feel grateful and happy doing so.&quot; 
<br />
<br />That night, on a repast of lightly sauteed frogs legs seasoned in a white wine and onion cream sauce, she chuckled to herself. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't f-ing think so.&quot;

<br />10 Things In Golf That Sound Dirty  
<br />
<br />1. Look at the size of his putter. 
<br />2. Oh, dang, my shaft's all bent. 
<br />3. You really wacked the hell out of that sucker. 
<br />4. After 18 holes I can barely walk. 
<br />5. My hands are so sweaty I can't get a good grip. 
<br />6. Lift your head and spread your legs. 
<br />7. You have a nice stroke, but your follow through leaves a lot to be desired. 
<br />8. Just turn your back and drop it. 
<br />9. Hold up. I've got to wash my balls. 
<br />10. Damn, I missed the hole again.

<br />[old but good
<br />
<br />A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana. She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.
<br />
<br />After becoming very frustrated with the &quot;no haggle&quot; attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, &quot;Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!&quot;
<br />
<br />The shopkeeper said, &quot;By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!&quot; Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.
<br />
<br />Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement. Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouts out, &quot;Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!&quot;

<br />A Letter From A Redneck Mother To Her Son  
<br />
<br />
<br />    Dear Son,
<br />
<br />    I'm writing this slow 'cause I know you can't read fast.  We don't live where we did when you left.  Your dad read in the paper that most accidents happen within twenty miles of home, so we moved. Won't be able to send you the address as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numbers with them for their house, so they wouldn't have to change their address.
<br />
<br />    This place has a washing machine.  The first day I put four shirts in it, pulled the chain and haven't seen 'em since.
<br />
<br />    It only rained twice this week, three days the first time and four days the second time.
<br />
<br />    The coat you wanted me to send to you, Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.
<br />
<br />    We got a bill from the funeral home, and it said if we didn't make the final payment on Grandma's funderal bill, up she comes.
<br />
<br />    About your sister, she had a baby this morning.  I haven't found out whether if it is a boy or a girl so don't know if you are an Aunt or Uncle.
<br />
<br />    Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey vat.  Some men tried to get him out, but he fought them off playfully, so he drowned.  We cremated him and he burned for three days.
<br />
<br />    Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup.  One was driving and the other two were in the back.  The driver got out.  He rolled down the window and swam to safery.  The other 2 drowned.  They couldn't get the tail gate down.
<br />
<br />    Not much more news this time.  Nothing much happened.  If you don't get this letter, please let me know and I will send another one.
<br />
<br />Love, Ma
