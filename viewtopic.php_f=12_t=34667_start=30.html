			<div class="content">I just picked up the Classic Trilogy on DVD today.  I'll tell you.  The Original Trilogy has NEVER looked or sounded better.  I watched Return of the Jedi.  The only glaring problem I saw was, during the duel between Vader and Luke.  The lightsabers looked like s**t.  They're uglier than they were in the versions of the movie.  That's the only real problem I noticed, that and they added Naboo to another of the planets celebrating the defeat of the Empire.  The inclusion of Hayden Christiansen at the end of the movie actually makes sense.  *Spoiler alert* The reason Hayden was cameoed here, was because of Episode III.  It's a tie-in to Episode III.
<br />
<br />On the Special Features disc, I checked out the feature about the next movie.  The Duel between Anakin and Obi-wan looks REALLY impressive.  It's incredibly fast and well choreographed.  The trailers and TV spots for the Classic Trilogy are so bad and so cheesy it's funny.  But that's what they used.
<br />
<br />I'll have to watch the other movies so I can give you the full review on this DVD set.</div>

			<div class="content">I bought them yesterday and had a quick lookie at ANH between work and woman. The new Jabba is a huge improvement over the VHS Jabba and the light sabers look a lot better, although Lukes saber when he is practicing on the Falcon still looks kinda odd. The whole thing looks a whole heap better than the VHS versions, definately worth the purchase if you be asking me.</div>

			<div class="content">@Esqy: No, not just you.  It was aimed at everybody who was complaining about the changes that George Lucas made to HIS movies.  My point was very simple, if there's nothing you can do about it, except not buy the movies, why bother complaining?  It's a waste of energy and a waste of time.   George Lucas will NOT listen, because he doesn't have to.</div>

			<div class="content">yeah, but my problem is that he's gone all ministry of truth on the films.
<br />I dont think he 100% understands why the first 3 films were so damned good to begin with, which is evident by the sodomised episodes 1 and 2. Sure its cool having new special effects and making the worlds look bigger on bespin etc. Those are aditions and changes that just bring it up-to-date so im not giggling about how poor the spaceships look in the 21st century. But when they add characters and change voices, and re-film sections of the film and cgi more and more it looks out of place and also, in some way, is kinda insulting. As if up until now, when we finally saw haden as anakins ghost that millions of star wars fans will all go &quot;aaaaaaahhhhhhh&quot; at the end of jedi when they sudenly realise that it was Anakin with yoda and obi-wan. What possible need could there be for the change?
<br />
<br />also, can the GENIUS asshole who has to stand up and obligatory say &quot;its lucas' film he can do what he wants to it so shutup loosers&quot; kindly shut up cause you're an ass. Maybe you should get up in front of protesters in new york calling for an end to the war and say &quot;george bush is president and isnt gonna listen to you so shutup you asses&quot; maybe they'll wander home and you can consider it a job well done...OR maybe people want to vent their frustration and band together and protest the changes to something which they hold very dear to them, knowing full well that lord lucas isnt browsing the forum and isnt going to do a damned thing other than what he wants. Theres no delusion that if we sign enough &quot;petition onlines&quot; or ***** loudly enough in a forum or irc, that we'll get what we want just want to let it known that some people apreciated them as they were.</div>

			<div class="content">@taw lol. I haven't seen that movie in years <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> possibly even decades (ooh that makes me feel old)
<br />
<br />@archie - looks like I'm the ass because....
<br />
<br />@the rest of you - I never understand when people slate lucas and his grand-slamming star wars series.  Its very simple really, if you want him to stop then boycott his films and merchandise.  Its that easy.  If it flops he's gone - and then your precious films will remain as they are.  But just for a second see it from my point of view...
<br />
<br />Since I was a little boy I have adored the star wars series.  I've known and forgotten every single line, every single scene, every single footstep and explosion in the original trilogy at least 100 times.  I still love them, albeit today for various other cinematic reasons.  But when people start complaining that the director has added or changed things they are out of line.  He was the writer, the conceiver, the whole star wars universe is his and his alone....to do with it as he sees fit.  If he decided to delete the lot, he could do, he has every right.  So stop moaning that he's &quot;ruining it&quot; by doing more, because in the end, he's just producing stuff that he conceived over 20 years ago.  So you don't like it? So what? Don't watch it!  It really is that simple.
<br />
<br />Of course lucas won't delete them because he is now a multi-million dollar corporation within himself....and maybe thats why he carrys on churning out star wars stuff.  But see it this way - he's making sh** loads of money continuing a saga that has become such and obsession to him, it has nearly destroyed his entire life on several occasions.  He loves the series - it was his conception - he's bound to.  And I imagine he'll keep on producing this stuff till they cart him away on a trolley....
<br />
<br />....and as far as I'm concerned - I hope he does.  I'm the kind of fan that wants to see more and more from the original creator.  I don't care if its crap.  Its from the same mind.  I don't want your poxy fan fiction - to me its pointless.  Until Lucas quits I will watch and collect every piece of the SW universe that he produces....every change, every addition or subtraction, its all about his mind refining and finishing what he started.  The originals will of course always be the greatest because it was those films that got us all hooked in the first place, but if you are going to moan because he keeps making changes and additions then go back to your original VHS versions....and if you don't have them, I'm willing to sell mine for a price.
<br />
<br />archie your argument makes no sense to me at all.  We're not talking about someone who started a war or has control over your lives, we're talking about a person who has created a form of art and decided to go back to it with newer technology and create what he wanted to originally.  To suggest that the situation is similar to a political ruler being overthrown only goes to show the obsession that fans have got to.  THAT IS SAD!  Its a film trilogy.  Its a few thousand miles of celluloid.  Its actors in big furry suits and men dressed in tin.  ITS NOT REAL.  Fans who think that they somehow own a piece of the franchise because they love it so much, are simply deluded.  The film does not belong to the fans, it belongs to the creator.  And this is the distinction between the Bush/Lucas comparison.  Americans own their country, Bush just runs it - whereas SW Fans own nothing but the DVD and Lucas owns it.

			<div class="content">I know what you mean Grom. The boxed set has been getting good reviews though, except for the &quot;over-hyped&quot; Ep3 duel scene <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. The thing is that I am worried that an even more special edition will be released that will contain even more extras, and will have different editions of Episodes 1, 2, and 3. Still, I guess that I'll have to risk it <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.

			<div class="content">I like the idea of the added parts. As George writes the newer stories, for imformation is known. You then want to use it in an order on that refers to or over laps that story. Like Star Trek TOS. If they kept the same effect when they made Next Gen, it would not have been good. I like the idea of incorperating the improvements. It fills in some of the blanks that the originals left. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">A Star Wars TV show is the worst idea I've heard in a long time...it will disgrace the series (although it's not already without its disgraces...Jar Jar Binks comes readily to mind). Another 3 movies set after episodes 4-6 sounds like a great idea though to me...I'd love to seek Luke, Han and Leia again.  Especially if it were the Grand Admiral Thrawn series...how cool would that be???

<br />You're probably thinking of the scene where the emporer gets off the shuttle, plenty more stormies in that one. Vader obviously doesn't warrent the full attention of all the death star stormies.</div>
