			<div class="content">GREETINGS!
<br />
<br />That's right, I'm NOT whining about lack of things to do. It just so happens that I like fighting impossible odds. Well, more like me versus the entire Sirius sector. Maybe that's why I get in so ggod with criminals (especially Corsairs, Omicron Gamma is my home, now).
<br />
<br />Anyway, right after the story I sought much profit, so I headed straight into the deep (DEEP) Borderworlds....in my Anubis.
<br />...so I spent most of my time running.
<br />
<br />Anyway, skip ahead...skip ahead.
<br />
<br />I just got in the good graces of &quot;The Big 3:&quot; Outcasts, Dragons, and Corsairs.
<br />I really wanted to find the Corsair homeworld, so I set off with just one piece of info to go on: its name, Omicron Gamma.
<br />So, I decided NOT to get a new, and save up for the Titan (I like the way it looks).
<br />I had previously gotten ALL Lv.10 weapons in the Rheinland wreck (80 years war) and I wanted to use them.
<br />
<br />Skip Ahead.
<br />
<br />I had gotten to Omega 41 in my Anubis, being saved time and time again by my criminal friends swooping down on my pursuers. This time, however, was different. I was being pursued by a VERY LARGE swarm. I had no shield batteries and a couple nanobots.
<br />Suddenly, my luck resumed its previous course, as I spotted a jumphole in the distance!
<br />I pulled whatever I could out of my Anubis ad headed for it.
<br />I was trailing flame I was about to die next to the hole. They fired the final shot that would end my long search.
<br />I heard a fizzle, I wondered what could possibly happen to spare my life. Then my Neural Net piped up: &quot;Shield Restored.&quot;
<br />YES!
<br />With that I hightailed it through the jumphole, with no knowledge of where I was going (I was too busy to notice the name of the system it lead to).
<br />
<br />-----I'll finish this later; I've now gotta hightail it to the bathroom-----
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------
<br />I do what I must, when I must...

			<div class="content">The moral of the story is to not post at 3:00 am; you tend to post in the wrong forum and have typos.
<br />My adventure just goes to show you that the story is not all that Freelancer is.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'll go into more depth of my flight into the jumphole.
<br />
<br />And now, PART 2 of of our adventure. In our last installment, our hero (ME!) had stumbled into the clammy hand of death himself.
<br />-------------------------------------STORY---------------------------------------------------
<br />(BTW, lol, Rhino)
<br />I took a mission from the Outcasts to take out a group of Hessians that was a little to big to tolerate.
<br />Suffice it to say, I was glad I took the mission in which they sent backup. Although I did manage to fight off the first wave of Sabres in my Anubis, the second wave was decimated by my Outcast buddies.
<br />
<br />I was combing the system for any leads on the whereabouts of Omicron Gamma (I don't get spoilers), but my exploration was cut short when a group of Sabre-toting Hessians descended upon me like a plague. And, like a plague, they did not go down (remember, I was still in that Anubis). Just when I thought I was about to get away, their &quot;reinforcements&quot; swooped down right in front of me. I fled, not knowing whether or not I would find a method of escape, or the proverbial rock with the hard place closing in fast.
<br />I could not count on my criminal buddies saving me; they WERE my ciminal buddies.
<br />BINGO!
<br />By this time, I was so far in debt with Lady Luck that I knew the collectors were bound to come, but she let me take out one more big loan.
<br />A jumphole.
<br />I didn't know where it went, and I had no time to even glance at the destination's name.
<br />I just wanted to climb out of the grave I had dug myself.
<br />The flame trailing from my dying ship rivalled that of the local star, that rock had appeared with the total dissolution of my shields.
<br />My shields were down and one of the jackals had fired the blast that would cover the grave over. But the god of the underworld came through, as my shields came back up just before the bolt of death hit. The jackals could never defeat their master.
<br />I launched a mine to throw the horde off, pulled my Anubis together, and hightailed it through the jumphole.
<br />
<br />I looked around at the bright system I emerged in. No attacks...that's a good sign.
<br />Even better, friendly ships on patrol. They looked familiar, so I took a closer look.
<br />Titans!
<br />Then the name of the system popped up on my HUD:
<br />Omicron Gamma
<br />
<br />I had emerged in my new home.
<br />
<br />Just then, the collectors found me, and I was fresh out of cash.
<br />The scanner picked up several Bounty Hunters inbound, the Corsairs were moving to intercept.
<br />And I was right in the middle.
<br />
<br />[the amazing thing is that I have not made up or embellished anything
<br />-I have decided to make this a continuing series-

			<div class="content">Jeez you write it like a frickin book.  It's all very elegant and interesting, except you kinda used some of the &quot;shields restoring at last second&quot; and &quot;not looking at jumphole name&quot; in the first part, but it is fun to read, and very visual.  You seem like a much more dedicated pilot to survival than I am...  I have always found that on the higher levels I live longer when i fight back than when i run.  But hey, i just love the mouse combat.
