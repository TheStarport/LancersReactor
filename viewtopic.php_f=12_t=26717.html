			<div class="content">I said this as I was writing Reynet - The Prince of Starfyre, I am no longer going to write any more plays for TLR.  They just get longer and longer and longer, all the while I do have other writing I need to attend to as well as a job that pays the rent.  So instead I offer up my notes and some links to the recent poster known as MU/_/_3T (aka Mullet or Mu as we affectionately called him).
<br />
<br />Why you may ask?  I want to see if you guys can put together a story. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  It doesn't have to be Shakespeare, use another story as a basis if you want.  Although Aceaz did come up with an interesting idea by using the Shakespeare play &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; to change it to &quot;The Rape of Lancers Reactor.&quot;  I liked that and if I was writing it, I would probably do that.  But I am not writing it, you are.
<br />
<br />You can work alone or together, however you see fit.  Look to the actual threads for an understanding of how it went down, but don't feel that you have to keep it exactly chronological.

<br />
<br />Oh and I think Spider posted some other nonsense in other threads too before everything all began, but I can't remember which ones.  Chances are I left a response to them though.
<br />
<br /><b>How it shaped up: </b>
<br />Spider was posting rubbish about magical journeys.  Aceaz was posting around this time too, but sensibly.  I responded to Spider have him stop his annoyance.  At that same time Mullet came forth with a giant SPAM! SPAM! thing, then he started his own thread.  Then another.  But then just concentrated on Spiders thread.
<br />
<br />I thought at first I had to deal with two lunatics, Aceaz joined me and also thought both would be banned.  But Spider calmed down and started acting normally and even helpful.
<br />
<br />After some posting back and forth, Mullet finally stopped and gave up for no reason than probably boredom.  There were no moderators until after he left.
<br />
<br />I tossed around a few weighty words, but I never got too riled up, as I am quite experienced in these matters now. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Aceaz kept his cool too, and Spider finally mellowed.
<br />
<br />A few onlookers came at the end, followed shortly by Mustang.  I never emailed Mustang as I didn't have his address, it could be one of the onlookers got a hold of him.
<br />
<br />That's how it all happened.  Now write it!  Or at least attempt it.
<br />
<br />----
<br />These quotes are for easy reference to who said what, it is out of order, but that may not matter how you form the story.  I don't have all of them, just most of them.  Most of Mullets are gone, especially the S S IS A TERD ones. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><b>Aceaz </b>
<br />Err..well, before this thread gets locked: kpleh!
<br />---
<br />Was that a strange enough SOUnD for you?
<br />---
<br />Wow, that sure is a lot of Spam. What exactly is your obbsesion with this 'meat'.
<br />---
<br />Spider, whats up with you?
<br />Whats with all the meat-related threads and posts?
<br />---
<br />Mu, what the hells the point?
<br />---
<br />sS, you could go to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/">http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/</a><!-- m --> to see all of Shakespeares plays. My suggestion would be: The Rape of Lucrece , edited to become The Rape of Lancers Reactor. Bloody spammers...
<br />---
<br />Au revoir!
<br />---
<br />Your post was like used toilet paper, screwed up and a bit s**tty
<br />---
<br />Who wants to make a bet that Mu and Sp/der are gonna be banned at the same time?
<br />---
<br />Go Spectre!
<br />---
<br />Twas a tale of tragedy, while the Mods had taken their leave, the spammers struck..
<br />
<br />Olde english is hard...
<br />---
<br />Could we have some kind of variety. Please. Repeating the same post will get you banned, and posssibly executed.
<br />---
<br />I'm not sure if this is on topic....It's not really so much of a strange sound as an annoying drone that just won't stop.
<br />---
<br />Indeed. We really do need someone to destroy this...
<br />---
<br />He's made some kind of impenatrable nest of Spam inside Sp/ders thread. (Which ironicly, was one of the more traditional forms of spam...)
<br />---
<br />
<br /><b>Spider </b>

<br />I will take you all on a magical journey through time.......

<br />now I go with putt putt on a magical journey through time 
<br />---
<br />ok I already said I was going to stop check here to see this...

<br />---
<br />Your right he is annoying 
<br />---
<br />we seriously need to get an admin/moderator here....

<br />Strange noises go here!!! by Blaxxer
<br />---
<br />Mu, you're on your way to be permanently banned. If you want to talk to us, talk. Don't do childish **** like that.
<br />---
<br />You'll only be a nuisance for so long.
<br />---
<br />Mu, you're a little puke.
<br />---
<br />This guy is going into one of my plays. Which Shakespeare play should I use this time?
<br />---
<br />I always get the last word. 
<br />---
<br />Spider careful or I'll turn you in with MU/_/_3T.
<br />---
<br />@Spider, now if you could only be a part of the conversation.
<br />---
<br />With any hope in irony Wizard'll be the one to delete all your posts.
<br />---
<br />Mullet, or Mu, whichever you prefer, you are a git and a total twonk as well.
<br />---
<br />Ranks won't do any good for someone who won't be able to come back. Twonk is a profanity that isn't really one, so it won't be bleeped on this site.
<br />---
<br />I'm already seeing to it.
<br />---
<br />@Aceaz Yeah, it sure isn't a lark's call.
<br />---
<br />I emailed the moderators twice.
<br />---
<br />MU/_/_3T give it up, you're not clever. We've seen better before. At least they did it with some originality.
<br />---
<br />At least Hey who was Psycho actually did something creative with his insanity, you're just a mild copy &amp; paster. Children can do that.

<br />---
<br />{In reference to the S S IS A TERD post} MU/_/_3T nice column definition, I like the layered effect on that one.
<br />---
<br />@Aceaz Yeah, it sure isn't a lark's call.
<br />---
<br />Aceaz, that's not a bad idea. I don't know that play, but I'll read it.
<br />---
<br />So far it looks as if the ****er has stopped.
<br />---
<br />{@Spider}You see now how I was confused about your possible role in this? 
<br />---
<br />I saw it before, but sure.  I'll post.  Though usually you shouldn't have to promote your other posts.  If people want to they'll post.
<br />---
<br />@Indy11, did you just miss the Off-Topic rapist known as MU/_/_3T? He spammed until our foums bled. There might be another play in this.
<br />---
<br />Nest, eh? Sounds rather disturbing. Like the way maggots infest the ass.
<br />---
<br />@WB &amp; Arania, I already did those things.

<br />i'm getting a mod
<br />---
<br />aceaz and ss,
<br />ur so right.
<br />
<br />i am seriously going to lose it soon.
<br />
<br />mu, put that spam where it misht be useful, befor i shove it back down your IC &lt;-- <b>This he said, then later replaced with this </b> --&gt; edit- i remembered, SPAM ISNT USEFUL
<br />
<br />oh, and my sig is just to intimidate.
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Mustang </b>
<br />
<br />Dammit now I'm pissed off, MU/_/_3T if you pull that sort of crap on these forums again and you will find yourself banned. Consider this your one and only warning *CLICK*
<br />
<br /><b>Indy11 </b>
<br />
<br />I agree. And here is why.
<br />
<br />You can see that Mu knew exactly what he was doing. It wasn't as if he was just having fun, he also knew he was being more than a little annoying and he took pleasure in that. People very politely asked him to stop and that just made him get worse.
<br />
<br />So what if he was just trying to have fun? If true, it reveals the mental age of the person and, quite frankly, I find it hard to believe that TLR would want such a mental midget to be able to stay on the site and, more than likely, do it again.
<br />
<br />*passes out torches to the townsfolk and lights his*
<br />
<br /> Ban Mu!

			<div class="content">Yeah write how you want to write it.  Just try to catch the spirit of what happened and make it imaginitive with how you apply it.  For instance, I once saw a really funny Star Wars spoof online.  A CG episodic story of Star Wars ep I &amp; IV characters living through their own version of Pulp Fiction.  Called Pulp Phantom.
<br />
<br />You could pick any other story to drop the characters into.  Or just write something original.
<br />
<br />I'm just curious to see what you come up with. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
