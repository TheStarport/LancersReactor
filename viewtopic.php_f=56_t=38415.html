			<div class="content">Welcome to Asgard - now try to survive. 
<br />
<br />Asgard was the dwelling place of the ruling titans. It was the goal for our new home here in Sirius to create such a glorious place. But that was three hundred years ago - before the Sirius Wars that almost destroyed us all. The hyper-electron explosions from the Solar Bombs nearly destroyed the delicate balance of all our light source stars. Suns burn with a dim glow now. Our previously beautiful systems are cloaked in darkness. 
<br />
<br />Three hundred years of exploration has led to the permanent opening of all jump holes between our regular explored systems. These six or seven jump holes allow unprecedented trade routes, but they also allow easy escape for pirates who lurk in the darkness. 
<br />
<br />Three hundred years of technology has given us slightly faster cruise engines, and has given us 80 new ships that are clearly evolutionary rather than revolutionary. From the hand of master shipwright Baene, you will see the strong linage back to the features and style of Liberty, Rheinland, Bretonia, or Kusari houses. 
<br />
<br />You will start your life in Asgard in a new ship you've never flown before, dumped on a pirate base in New York. You're on your own to fight your way back to law abiding society or try to make up with the pirates fast. You'll notice a few extra credits in your pocket, but it's up to you what to do with them. 
<br />
<br />This is a world ripe for pirates to harvest. With its dark systems and tougher ships clans can grow and prosper. We need the best law enforcement flyers out there to form up in the Sirius Guard and bring some order to this &quot;dwelling place of the ruling titans.&quot; Right now it feels more like a world on the edge of total collapse. 
<br />
<br />To assist factions gain an edge, there are sixteen Faction Sponsored Ships that are in the game but not buyable until some faction - pirate or law - meets the requirements to purchase Title to a particular ship. Full details of this new process are available in the Faction forum. 
<br />
<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
<br />Asgard is a world about variety: A minor change from the basic design. This is 93% pure Freelancer. There have been no changes to systems or bases, existing ships, AI, or commodities. Other than the light which you will miss immediately, everything you know about Freelancer is still true - but with a few additions. 
<br />
<br />This mod was designed to be played in multiplayer. It is hosted 24/7 on the Asgard RPG Server- a P4 2.4, 2GB RAM computer running through a high speed DSL connection. Server and game admins are committed to making this the best FL gaming environment ever. Just ask them if you need something. 
<br />
<br />All credit goes to Baene for the most amazing and appropriate original ships to be added to Freelancer. And credit goes to Louva-Deus for his world altering original creation RealSpace. Both these talented people were kind enough to let me hack together a mod using their brilliant work, while making major changes to it all so our new world holds together in a balanced, playable way. 
<br />
<br />Welcome to Asgard. Make it your home.
