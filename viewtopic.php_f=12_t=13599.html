			<div class="content">Ok, all of you jokers out there I made this topic for only one reason&#8230;to hear that is to read some of the jokes you know and all of you to read jokes I know.
<br />
<br />I will start of with one of the stories my teacher told me (true story possibly).I know what are you thinking &#8220;true story can not be funny&#8220;. Well you are wrong as you will see soon.
<br />
<br />Ok this is how it starts:
<br />
<br />One day teacher decided to show his class movie about Vikings (please do not ask me the name of the movie) anyway once the movie finished teacher asks his class if there are any questions. He sees one hand in the back and calls the student to ask the question.
<br />&#8220;Mr. Brown, (not the teachers real name), I did not know that they had cameras in that time&#8221;
<br />
<br />The thing is this STUPID question was asked by an 8th grader. And future supposed to rest on them.
<br />
<br />Ok now that was my part ,now I want to hear (me and my hearing again) I mean to red some of funny stuff you people know.
<br />
<br />OK now there is only one rule - This topic is for jokes only,anything else will be deleted
<br />
<br />
<br /> May strong survive and weak perish

			<div class="content">THESE ARE POSTS FROM OTHER JOKE TOPIC OF MINE THAT DISAPPEARED.
<br />
<br />Okay, ya'll might not think it's funny because I am known for my geekhood. On top of that, those without a clear understanding of the English language will probably not understand it. That said here's my story.
<br />
<br />My senior year in high school - at a very small, private, Baptist school - we had an Economics class. The administrator of the entire school was our regular teacher. Periodically, he would have the high school student advisor fill in for him because she was previously an Economics teacher herself. So, one day, we didn't have much to do and the advisor was teaching the class, so she went down the aisles and asked each of us what our plans were for college. She gets to one of my friends (we'll call her Pam) and asks what her plans are for college.
<br />
<br />Pam says that she doesn't intend to go to college because she doesn't know what she wants to do with her life and she has a lot of friends who are college-age and do not go to college and are doing okay for themselves.
<br />
<br />The advisor asks, &quot;What about your friends here in high school?&quot;
<br />
<br />Pam replies, &quot;I don't have any friends here.&quot;
<br />
<br />I look at Pam and say, &quot;Hey!&quot;
<br />
<br />Pam says, &quot;Oh, right, except Andrew.&quot;
<br />
<br />My other friend (we'll call her Jane) echoes my reply.
<br />
<br />Pam says, &quot;Oh, and Jane, too...sometimes.&quot;
<br />
<br />I, in my infinite geekhood, then make this (in my opinion) funny statement: &quot;Sometimes? What is she? The vowel ' y ' ?&quot;
<br />
<br />Only Pam laughed because Jane, along with the other five people in the immediate vicinity, including the advisor, didn't get it. In addition, the other ten or so people in the class simply didn't hear it.
<br />
<br />Eventually, Jane got the joke and we now periodically acknowledge her as &quot;y.&quot;
<br />
<br />If anyone doesn't get it, I will now explain. The English alphabet consists of 26 letters. Five of those are the vowels A, E, I, O, U. In the English language, the letter &quot;y&quot; is SOMETIMES considered a vowel to uphold the rule that every word in the English language must contain at least one vowel. This validates the words &quot;sky,&quot; &quot;fly,&quot; &quot;fly,&quot; &quot;sly,&quot; &quot;rhythm,&quot; and so forth.
<br />
<br />Yeah, I'm done.

<br />Well that was not bad.
<br />Now come on people don't be shy post some of jokes you know.
<br />
<br />Well here is one of true stories again but this time i do not think it was an 8th grader.
<br />
<br />It was movie time again but this time it was Jurassic Park.
<br />As the movie finished teacher asks again if there are any questions, as always there is one:
<br />&quot;Mr. Brown I did not know dinosaurs existed today&quot;
<br />As the kid asks this question another kid laughs and answers:
<br />&quot;You idiot dinosaurs died hundreds of years ago&quot;.
<br />
<br />
<br />For those who do not get this dinosaurs died millions of years ago.

<br />&quot;After a number of attacks on hikers and campers in Alaska, the Department of Fish and Game released the following advisory: 
<br />We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing so as not to startle bears. We also advise outdoorsmen to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear. It is also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.
<br />
<br />Outdoorsmen should recognize the difference between Black Bear and Grizzly Bear poop. Black bear poop is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur. Grizzly bear poop has little bells in it and smells like pepper. &quot;
<br />
<br />and just one more, much longer but definetly worth it:

<br />
<br />&quot;One day a kid was sitting at home waiting for his relatives to come over. He overheard his parents fighting with each other yelling &quot;YOU BITCH&quot; &quot;YOU BASTARD&quot;.
<br />
<br />Being so young, the kid had never heard those words before and asked his parents what they meant. They replied by saying &quot;Bitch means lady and bastard means gentlemen&quot;. Satisfied with this answer the boy went to his room. 
<br />
<br />Then he heard the neighbors having sex. They were repeating the words &quot;DICK and &quot;CUNT&quot; over and over and over. Again, the boy was curious and asked his parents what those words meant. Thinking fast, his mother said &quot;Dick means coat and cunt means jackets.&quot;
<br />
<br />Once again the boy was satisfied with the answer and headed to the bathroom, but his father was shaving and the boy had to wait. Fearing that the boy might wet himself, the father shaved faster. He went a little to quick and ended up cutting himself,&quot;s***!!!!!&quot; he yelled. &quot;What's s*** mean daddy,&quot; the boy asked . The father, stuck for an answer said, &quot;it means shaving cream.&quot; 
<br />
<br />The boy did his &quot;business&quot; and his dad went back to shaving. His next stop was the kitchen, there he saw his mother preparing the turkey. As she reached for a knife she ended up cutting herself. &quot;AW f***!!&quot;, she yelled. &quot;What's f*** mean mommy&quot;, the boy asked. &quot;It means stuffing the turkey.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Finally, the guest arrived, the boy went to the door and said, &quot;Hello bitches and bastards, may I take your dicks and cunts? Dad's in the bathroom putting s*** on his face and Mom is in the kitchen f***ing the turkey!&quot;

<br />Kim, you need the url of the image, NOT the page. That does not look like an image URL at all. To find an image's url, right click on the image and click properties. You will see Address (URL): .....
<br />
<br />And here's another clue: image urls ALWAYS end with .jpg or .gif, the most common of web image format.

<br />The joke about Kirk, is a refference to the fact that in most Episodes Kirk had a Fist Fight in some sand, or something to that effect.

<br />This may be slightly adult humour (ie it has sexual references) but it runs along similar lines to the teacher - student jokes. I'm sorry if anyone's offended, don't take it seriously.
<br />
<br />OK its the sexual education lessons in Biology and the teacher is explaining how semen is full of glucose. The next moment the blonde bimbo at the back of the class sticks her hand in the air. The teacher says &quot;Yes, Susan?&quot;
<br />To which she asks &quot;Then why does it taste so salty?&quot;

<br />Ok, i got most of them. Th pilot/stewardess one is just wrong, though.
<br />
<br />Here are a few more I stole off a website. 
<br />
<br />A guy walks into the bar and yells, &quot;All right all you SOBs get out of this bar.&quot; Everybody cleared out except for one little English man in a little black suit and little bowler hat. &quot;Well?&quot; yells the bad guy. &quot;Certainly were a bunch of them weren't there,&quot; replied the little English man. 
<br />
<br />The blonde driving from New York to Florida saw signs that read &quot;Clean Restrooms.&quot; 
<br />By the time she got to Georgia, she had already cleaned 132. 
<br />
<br />Two guys were sitting outside a medical clinic. One of them was crying, tears were pouring down his face. The other guy asked, &quot;Why are you crying?&quot; The first one replied, &quot;I came here for a blood test.&quot; The second one asked, &quot;So? Why are you crying? Are you afraid?&quot; The first guy replied, &quot;No. Not that. During the blood test they cut my finger.&quot; 
<br />Hearing this, the second one started crying. The first one was astonished and asked the other,&quot;Why are you crying?&quot; 
<br />Then the second guy replied, &quot;I'm here for a urine test.&quot; 
<br />
<br />A married fellow gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. 
<br />&quot;What's up?&quot; he asks. 
<br />&quot;I'm having a heart attack,&quot; cries the woman. 
<br />He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he's dialing, his 4-year-old son comes up and says, &quot;Daddy! Daddy! Uncle Ted's hiding in your closet and he's got no clothes on!&quot; 
<br />The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife, and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure enough, there is his brother, totally naked, cowering on the closet floor. 
<br />&quot;You bastard!!!&quot; says the husband. &quot;My wife's having a heart attack, and all you can do is run around the house naked scaring the kids?&quot; 
<br />
<br />A burglar breaks into a house in the middle of the night and as he is disconnecting the stereo he hears &quot;Jesus is watching you&quot;. He shines his flashlight around the room and sees nothing , so he continues.Again he hears &quot;Jesus is watching you&quot;. He checks the room again and sees a parrot in the corner. He asks the parrot if he is talking to him and the parrot says &quot;Jesus is watching you&quot;. The burglar asks the parrot his name and the parrot says Moses. The burglar laughs and says what a stupid name that is for a parrot, and asks the parrot what idiot named him that and the parrot replies &quot;the same idiot who named the rottweiller Jesus.&quot; 
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />Now remember[[! First you pillage and THEN you burn[[!

			<div class="content">@Leonhart: I actually found your previous thread - it's sth about a dozen positions down and is called &quot;jokes&quot;. Since there are twi identical threads now, I think you can safely delete one of them in order to avoid server overload<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Also, due to some highly sensitive reactions to my pilot/stewardess joke, I'd like to remove it in order to avoid hurting somebody's feelings. However, now that it has become a part of your posting, I can't do that. Would you do it for me? 
<br />
<br />Now, some new jokes (hope they're harmless<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) (actually, I tried to edit my previous message and poste them before, but somehow it didn't work out)

<br />A masochist meets a sadist.
<br />Masochist: beat me, beat me hard, pleeease!
<br />Sadist: No.

<br />A guy is walking with a rope and a loaf of bread in his hands. Another guy asks: &quot;What's goin' on?&quot;
<br />&quot;Ahh, life sux, I'm gonna go hang myself&quot;
<br />&quot;So why in the hell do you need this loaf?&quot;
<br />&quot;Who knows how long i'm gonna be hanging there?&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />A guy comes home dead drunk. He creeps into his bed, to his wife. Somehow he realizes that sth is wrong. He starts counting the feet sticking out from under the blanket. &quot;1,2,3,4,5,6&quot;. Wait, there's REALLY sth wrong! Ok, he tries it from the other end: &quot;1,2,3,4,5,6&quot;. &quot;****!&quot; he jumps out from the bed and counts the feet once again: &quot;1,2,3,4&quot;. &quot;Ahh, everything's okay now&quot;.

<br />Two pilots are flying an old two-seated plane. One yells: &quot;John, the readings!&quot;

			<div class="content">Allright, here's a sick one.  
<br />
<br />A guy goes into a bar and is congratulated by the bartender who says he's the first customer.  He then tells him that he has the right to name the bar.
<br />
<br />He thought for a minute, then said, &quot;Well how 'bout 'Sally's Legs?'&quot;
<br />
<br />So the bar was now called &quot;Sally's Legs.&quot;  The next morning, he comes back, and sees an old guy sitting outside.  He asks what he's doing, to which the man responds, &quot;I'm waiting for Sally's Legs to open so I can get a drink.&quot;

			<div class="content">a few very tasteless ones for yall
<br />
<br />
<br />Q: what's more fun than watching a baby spin around a clothesline at 100 km/h?
<br />A: stopping it with a shovel
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />A woman was lying in her hospital bed recuperating after an intense
<br />12 hour delivery of a bouncing baby boy. Moments later the hospital room door opened, and in walked the delivery nurse carrying the baby boy ....
<br />
<br />Suddenly the nurse throws the baby on the floor, kicks it up against the wall, picks it up and twirls it around several times and smashes it against the wall
<br />
<br />Well, just bewildered, the woman gives out a loud SHREEEK and hollers MY GOD ..... WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BABY ??????
<br />
<br />The Nurse chuckles a little to herself 'April Fools', she says...he was already dead
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Did you guys here about the new Pirate Movie??
<br />It's rated....ARRRRRGHHHHHHHHHH

			<div class="content">A prince went to Paris, entered the best restaurant and ordered sth special, national. he was given a frog. Accidentally, the frog dropped on the floor and turned into a beautiful princess. The prince banged the princess against the floor (literally, i mean, no obscenities<img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) several times, but no, she didn't turn back into the frog. So, what to do, he had to eat the dish as it was.
<br />
<br />&quot;Daddy, why is my grandma running around the garden&quot;
<br />&quot;Whose grandma, and whose mother-in law&quot;, answered the guy changing the clip in his machinegun.
<br />
<br />&quot;How do you like my wife?&quot;
<br />&quot;Pretty good&quot;
<br />&quot;Then take another slice&quot;
<br />
<br />A knight comes to a huge cave to challenge the dragon and to save the princess. 
<br />&quot;Come out you beast and fight me&quot; - yells he into the cave.
<br />&quot;Ok, ok, just stop shouting into my a$$&quot;, the dragon answers.
<br />
<br />What's a knoght to a dragon?
<br />Ca. 70 kg of canned meat.
<br />
<br />&quot;OMG, doc, what happened to me?&quot;
<br />&quot;OMG, what happened to you?&quot;
<br />
<br />Some thought about women (these are not mine<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)HARD-DISK Woman:
<br />She remembers everything, FOREVER.
<br />RAM Woman:
<br />She forgets about you, the moment you turn her off.
<br />WINDOWS Woman:
<br />Everyone knows that she can't do a thing right, but no one can live 
<br />without
<br />her.
<br />EXCEL Woman:
<br />They say she can do a lot of things but you mostly use her for your

<br />SCREENSAVER Woman:
<br />She is good for nothing but at least she is fun!
