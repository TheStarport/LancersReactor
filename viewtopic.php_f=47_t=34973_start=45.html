			<div class="content">Tanya left Tau 31 Construction Site station an hour later.
<br />
<br />Only when she was safely back on her ship, a Dromedary freighter, flying towards Kusari space did she relax. The cockpit of the freighter was spacious, there was enough room for two passengers and a reasonable amount of personal equipment. Tanya had bought the freighter from the Lane Hackers at Mactan Base, they barely tolerated her and only because she had done a number of raids on vulnerable storage depots to acquire some valuable engine components.
<br />
<br />Engaging in illegal activities didn't sit well with Tanya, she knew that working independently meant she had to survive through any means. At least no-one was hurt and the depots could always be repaired. She could have stolen more but was satisfied with taking enough cargo to purchase the ship, weapons, equipment and convert a section of the freighter into living quarters.
<br />
<br />The young woman decided until she had settled matters with those involved in the great Houses, limiting her interaction with people was a wise idea. Tanya found it hard though. She was a natural people person. Once she had confirmed that no further records of her past existed, she would change her name and move on with her life. Sirius was such a large place, it would be unlikely anyone from Orbital Spa would recognise her, pilots come and go and life expectancy was now much shorter than society would expect given such huge technological advances.
<br />
<br />She tried to recall her family, but the memories wouldn't come to her. Her family 'account' was still active, through further enquiries Tanya learnt she had set up the account herself. She decided it was best left alone for now, any transfers of credits could be easily tracked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Life is cheap,&quot; said Kenji's voice in her mind. &quot;But always worth fighting for,&quot; he finished. She smiled at the memory.
<br />
<br />___
<br />
<br />
<br />Two days later, Tanya landed her dromedary at Planet Hamburg. It was probably the most cosmopolitan planet in the strict disciplinarian world of Rheinland space, due to its position on the main trade route between Liberty and the rest of the territory. Tanya felt very comfortable on Hamburg; the melting pot of cultures made it the perfect place for someone who wanted to disappear. 
<br />
<br />For the right price, Tanya could start a new life and move on. Tanya knew a man who created false identities. Marco Van Koenig also erased old ones. He was a retired Rheinland Military Intelligence officer in his forties and skilled in the arts of forgery and information subterfuge. She couldn't remember how she knew of Marco, perhaps an icon from her previous 'life' as House assassin, but she would trust him. Fragments of memory would flash by her eyes again, a conversation here or there, a request, a payment, a collection.
<br />
<br />The young woman had altered her hair, it was blonde now and a little shorter than before, coming to her shoulders rather than languishing near the middle of her back. The clothes were that of a freelance trader or merchant, loose slacks, flight jacket, shirt, boots and cap that was currently under her arm completed the outfit. No more jumpsuits, she decided.
<br />
<br />Tanya left the landing pad and walked a hundred metres to an area where she could hire a sky cab. Although she was an expert pilot, someone with greater knowledge of the terrain would be an advantage here. Tanya joined the short queue and minutes later was at the front. A pleasant looking man in his mid-twenties gave his best smile as he saw her approach.
<br />
<br />&quot;Gutentag, fraulein. Welcome to Planet Hamburg. What destination do you require?&quot; he asked with professional courtesy. His eyes lingered on Tanya's a little longer than necessary.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hello. I'd like to go to this address, please,&quot; Tanya produced a card from her pocket and showed the attendant. He raised an eyebrow.
<br />
<br />&quot;Miss, that area is no place for you. It is,&quot; he paused trying to find a suitable word. &quot;Dangerous. A woman of your..like you,&quot; he blushed furiously. She smiled encouragingly. &quot;Would be noticed quickly,&quot; he finished at last.
<br />
<br />&quot;I can take care of myself,&quot; she replied in good humour. Tanya expertly twisted her hair up, tied it using a band and placed her cap on her head. Though she was still devastatingly attractive up close, at a distance she was just another pilot. &quot;Does this help?&quot; she asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. Yes. Of course. I will find you a good skycab. P-please wait here,&quot; stammered the hapless attendance. Tanya glanced behind her, no-one was following her or in the queue, though a large shuttle had just landed two pads away. The attendant raised his hand to the commset over his head and spoke swiftly, too quiet for Tanya to hear over the roar of the flying vehicles overhead. About a minute later a skycab descended, lowered its landing gear and settled on the concourse.
<br />
<br />Tanya nodded her approval at the smooth landing. Seeing her reaction the attendant grinned again.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is a good pilot, one of the best!&quot; he said, then stepped in much closer to Tanya's surprise and spoke again more softly this time. &quot;Miss, I would very much like to meet you again. Please consider my request, I know many good restaurants in the city. I could show you the sights!&quot; he suggested enthusiastically.
<br />
<br />Tanya's green eyes locked onto his own of dark brown, detecting no malice or hidden intent, just youthful vigour. She laughed and looked thoughtful. The man looked like he was about to burst in trepidation.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sure. Where and when?&quot; she said at last.
<br />
<br />The attendant virtually jumped.
<br />
<br />&quot;At the Oder Plaza Hotel. It is popular and well-known. There is a ball tonight, to celebrate the turning from dark to light of Planet New Berlin. I have tickets. Well, my father has tickets and he cannot go, therefore I have tickets. You will come? Dinner? A ball afterwards? The ballroom is beautiful.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya considered this. A quiet dinner was acceptable. But a ball? She did not want to be so exposed in such a public environment. The attendant noticed her hesitation.
<br />
<br />&quot;It is a masquerade ball! A masked event! No-one will see you. Just meet me at the hotel lobby and I will have your mask ready,&quot; he said. His final push.
<br />
<br />&quot;Very well,&quot; Tanya relented. She could use the opportunity to relax, a masquerade ball would work well. If Marco did his job, she could even test her new identity. So what do I call you, sir?&quot; she said, her genuine good humour making her eyes sparkle. The attendant went weak at the knees.
<br />
<br />&quot;My name? Of course, my name! I haven't told you!&quot; He cleared his throat. &quot;I am Rutger, Rutger Daumann,&quot; he said proudly with a slight theatrical bow. Tanya had heard the name before.
<br />
<br />&quot;Daumann. Of the Daumann Heavy Construction company?&quot; she asked curiously. Tanya glanced over her shoulder and saw passengers disembarking from the shuttle and approaching the skycab pads.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes! I am of the illustrious Daumann legacy. My father, Baron Hector Daumann is away on business at the Breisen Mining Facility,&quot; Rutger replied curtly.
<br />
<br />&quot;But wait, if your father owns Daumann, what are you doing here..as a..skycab attendant?&quot; asked Tanya incredulous now. Rutger looked sheepish.
<br />
<br />&quot;My father tells me this is good work experience. A humbling experience. I see many people and they must all be treated with respect. No matter how discourteous they are, I must take the higher road,&quot; was the reply. Tanya looked bemused.
<br />
<br />&quot;Your father is a wise man,&quot; she said carefully. &quot;I would be delighted to accept your offer. I will be at the Oder Plaza Hotel tonight, at 1900 standard hours.&quot; Tanya stepped on board the skycab, the engines were still active and thrumming under her feet. &quot;Don't be late!&quot; she chided, then closed the door.
<br />
<br />The skycab took off and joined a fast-moving carriageway where other craft were flying at speed.
<br />
<br />Rutger looked up and watched her vehicle disappear around the corner of a tall skyscraper. Suddenly he noticed a crowd of angry passengers had gathered before him, all were staring, waiting for the attendant to help them. It was going to be a long day, but she was worth it.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh no!&quot; he wailed. &quot;I didn't even ask for her name!&quot;

			<div class="content">Daumann, eh? Nice touch. I hope that humour was the objective in your descriptions of that young man becuase humour is what you created.

<br />As has become my custom I do have one paragraph to criticize...

<br />
<br />The sentence that describes Hamburg needs to be reworked. The &quot;most cosmopolitan planet in the strict disciplinarian world of Rheinland space&quot; bit just seems funny. I think it probably has something to do with the whole planet/world/space thing. I don't know exactly what point you are trying to make with it so I can't offer more specific advice. As for the final sentence I'd just switch it around a little to something more like this:

<br />I'm very intereseted to see what you do with the ball.

			<div class="content">Okay. Let me attempt to explain what I was trying to do. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I was trying to define how Planet Hamburg was a place where people were tolerant and less prejudiced of other cultures and people. To the point where few questions would be asked and no-one would take notice of another stranger around.
<br />
<br />This compares to the rest of Rheinland space, where every rumour suggests that the region has closer links to an army camp, than 'civilised' space!
<br />
<br />Oh. About Daumann, yes. Humour was the objective. The last few sections were quite dark and deep. I felt an injection of humour was necessary.
<br />
<br />I think we all recognise the behaviour young Daumann displays. He of the uncomfortable male population that have so many desires (read: hormones), supported by the lack of confidence in 'seriously' approaching a member the female population for the first time. I have seen plenty of this. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Changed the last sentence, good spot <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<h3><a href="#p332872" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Tanya's skycab flew effortlessly amongst the upper levels of Hamburg City, the main population centre on Planet Hamburg.
<br />
<br />Her vehicle joined hundreds of others travelling through a sky lane, a much smaller planetary version of the huge trade lanes that assist intra-system travel in Sirius. She was heading for the 'Reeperbahn', a dilapidated section of sky lane heading west out of the city, where surrounding suburbs were infamous for criminal activity, prostitution and gun-running.
<br />
<br />The young woman was sat in the back seat of her skycab, a vehicle large enough to hold six passengers and luggage capable of reaching speeds of three-hundred kilometres per hour. The driver was clearly very experienced. On occasion he would slip smoothly out of a sky lane to take a non-power assisted lane, only to join another sky lane further down.  She checked her watch and started a mental timer, seven hours to the ball she agreed to attend.
<br />
<br />Tanya sighed. She was rarely a creature of impulse but there was something about Rutger that made her accept his offer. He was handsome, but he also had a sincerity that she considered a rare commodity these days. That and the fact it was a masquerade ball, anonyminity was virtually guaranteed. Lost in her thoughts her gaze focused on a point in the distance, the buildings flew past at impossible speeds until eventually the skyline changed. Tanya noticed the skycab descending into the lower levels of the city, passing a blanket of smog and cloud then bursting into freeflight as the sky lane ended.
<br />
<br />She landed close to the site of where her contact, a fixer named Marco van Koenig could be found. He had agreed to meet her through an encoded message board, one reserved for people in her line of work, or at least, the kind of work Tanya used to be involved with.
<br />
<br />They arranged to meet in a secluded part of town, close to the sky lane but hidden behind tall buildings. Tanya checked she wasn't being followed at irregular intervals altering her route and sometimes doubling-back on herself.
<br />
<br />&quot;You're paranoid, girl,&quot; she told herself. &quot;No-one in their right mind would be wandering around out here.&quot;
<br />
<br />Thirty minutes later, Tanya found herself at the foot of a staircase that led to a disused church, a strong wind blew through the courtyard causing several howls and whistles as air passed between cracks and gaps. The young woman glanced up, though it was still mid-morning the smog ceiling made the sky overcast and dull. Taking a quick glance left and right, Tanya ran up the steps and gingerly opened one of the front doors, pleased to find it open and surprisingly well-oiled, it didn't creak at all. She pushed open the door, stepped inside and closed it behind her, immediately shutting out the howl and creating a tangible silence.
<br />
<br />Tanya noted the interior of the church was in a renaissance style, though some decoration and renovation wouldn't go amiss. She peered into the gloom and saw only dust floating randomly caught in beams of light, created by muck-covered windows around the walls. She took a chance.
<br />
<br />&quot;Marco! Are you here? It is Tanya?&quot; she called out, then heard her name echo back at her.
<br />
<br />There was no reply.
<br />
<br />&quot;Marco!&quot; she tried again. &quot;I'm alone. Come out, it's safe!&quot; she shouted. Tanya heard a quick shuffle coming from the area ahead of her, by the altar perhaps. Cursing herself for being unarmed, she slipped into the shadows and crept along the left wall, focusing her attention around the altar. As she neared the altar, a terrible smell struck her, a rotting, musky scent. The smell of the dead, she thought.
<br />
<br />Tanya glanced around looking for a weapon and to her dismay found only an ancient leather-bound hymn book and shrugged picking it up, smiling as she measured the weight. She closed on the altar and as the smell became stronger, almost retched at what she saw. Marco was lying in a naked, crumpled heap behind the altar, a twisted grimace of pain on his face giving away the moment of death as terrifying. She shook her head sadly, Marco had been a kind man, though a true felon, wanted in several systems for forgery and information subterfuge, but the old man was harmless. He was like the old uncle Tanya never had.
<br />
<br />The girl dragged a drape down from a wall nearby and walked over to him with it, several rats disturbed by the movement scurried away, probably the cause of the shuffling Tanya heard before. She closed his eyes then lay the drape on top of him, suddenly tense.
<br />
<br />She had agreed to meet the fixer a week ago, contacting him almost immediately leaving the Tau systems. If Marco had been dead for at least three days, someone must have known about their arrangement and left him here, at their designated place of meeting. Is this a coincidence? She shook her head, berating herself for even thinking of it. 
<br />
<br />&quot;There are no coincidences,&quot; said a voice in her mind. A flash of light appeared behind her eyes again, a scene from years ago as she underwent her first days of training. &quot;If an event occurs and you have doubts, no matter how small, desist and exit. Dead men do not complete missions,&quot; said her tutor. Tanya ran to the small steps leading to the pulpit and hid behind the stone wall.
<br />
<br />Minutes later her worst fears became true and the main door to the church opened. The wind outside had reached a sudden crescendo so she missed the number of people entering the building. Then the door shut and the church was still once more. Tanya heard muffled voices, as though spoken through an earpiece and curbed her reaction to see the newcomers for herself.
<br />
<br />She heard movement coming from ahead of her, it was oppressive. Damn it, she thought. How did this happen? She felt the weight of the hymn book under her arm and hefted it. About six feet away was a window, weakened from years of poor maintenance. Tanya risked revealing her location, but at least the reaction would tell her if these people were friendly or otherwise.
<br />
<br />Tanya threw the book with all her might at the window, causing a mighty crash as fragments of glass fell to the ground. The girl leapt from behind the pulpit and using all the power in her legs, stepped onto a bench for height and forward flipped into a somersault. The wall around her chipped and exploded as projectile gunfire pounded the frame. An energy beam narrowly missed her and melted a chunk of window that stubbornly refused to shatter. Tanya almost whooped in joy as her spinning body cleared the window frame and landed on the grounds outside. She took off to her right and ran for the back of the church. Loud voices could be heard coming from the church.
<br />
<br />At least that settled one thing, they weren't friendlies.
<br />
<br />She ran again away from the church wall towards the graveyard and made for a large headstone with an expensive looking plot. Tanya hunkered down behind the large stone and waited. It wasn't long before her attackers slowly approached the back of the church and from both sides leapt out. Tanya nodded in approval, attacking from two points is sensible, the fact they didn't shoot each other meant they were well-trained.
<br />
<br />They were all dressed similarly, dark urban gear, flak vests, no helmets indicated a touch of arrogance. Tanya counted four men in all. She looked for the leader. There was always a leader. One man, taller than the others and carrying the only energy weapon started barking orders. They split up into pairs and began moving towards the graveyard. She watched one pair walk back around the church and head towards the far graveyard. The other pair walked towards her.
<br />
<br />Tanya noted the way they carefully walked, one man moving ahead while the other remained behind to cover his flanks. Then the lead man stopped and the one behind moved ahead using the same technique. Predictable, but solid, she thought. The point they were vulnerable was when they were almost standing next to each other. Trained by amateurs, she mused.
<br />
<br />She slowly moved around the headstone to place that and other objects between her and the men. Glancing over her shoulder to ensure the other pair hadn't returned, Tanya then began to creep closer to the nearest pair and smiled as her trailing hand closed around a fist-sized stone. Within moments, she was within twenty feet and behind the pair.
<br />
<br />Tanya took a deep breath, then silently burst out from her hiding place running at full speed. A heartbeat later she had closed half the distance and threw the stone as hard as she could. It took one of the men at the base of the skull, hammering into the nerve bundle at the top of his spine. He twitched spasmodically and fell forwards. Before he hit the ground, Tanya leapt and spun, her body spinning in a tight circle then lashed out her right foot, crashing into the leaders' temple forcing him to drop his gun and tumble onto his dying companion. She landed lightly and rushed forwards punching the man in the head stunning him. Tanya grabbed his energy blaster and shot the dying, twisting, man once. Energy weapons made no sound, but she heard his back sizzling from where she struck him. She grabbed the projectile gun off the ground and fired it once into the leaders' leg. Then turned and waited.
<br />
<br />Moments later the other pair came running around the corner of the church and with great accuracy and speed, Tanya dropped them both with the blaster.
<br />
<br />The young woman turned her attention back to the unconscious man, a cold and determined expression on her face.
<br />
<br />They had come to kill her, ambush her as she was meeting an old friend that was now dead.
<br />
<br />She would need some time with this one, to learn everything he knew.
<br />
<br />
<br />***
<br />
<br />The Oder Plaza Hotel was a sumptuous sight. Tanya had never seen such a lavish and luxurious location for a party. Even the large causeway had been filled with gold and silver balloons, shimmering drapes and a huge number of waiting staff to cater for all the guests' possible needs.
<br />
<br />Tanya had arrived two hours before and having booked a room with a view of the causeway, was able to wait until she saw Rutger arrive in his huge Daumann Armoured Transport. She saw him walk out, flanked by a group of four bodyguards and smiled. He was definitely better than handsome! Gorgeous, might be more appropriate. The young man had almost transformed from the skycab attendant she met earlier in the day, wearing a white tuxedo, a white and blue sash over his shoulder, then down across his chest and a ceremonial sword hanging from his waist completed the attire. His boots were smart and polished, lights reflecting off the surface. He looked every inch the son of a Baron, and heir to the Daumann Heavy Industries' empire.
<br />
<br />She stepped out onto the balcony and was startled to see Rutger staring straight back at her. How had he known she was there? Tanya chuckled. How would the son of Baron Daumann 'not' know where she was staying? It amused, but alarmed her. The name she used to register the room was a false one. Tonight, Tanya was Evelyn O'Connor. A trader from Bretonia space, no known family and being spaceborn it would place her with one of millions of other spaceborns who knew nothing of their lineage. A legacy from Marco's era, she thought sadly.
<br />
<br />Tanya left the balcony and made her way to the elevators.
<br />
<br />Minutes later, she walked out into the lobby and noted with secret pleasure, the impact of her arrival on the waiting Daumann heir who barely managed to close his mouth as he gazed upon her.
<br />
<br />The young woman was dressed in a simple, yet devastatingly attractive maroon dress made from velvet and lace, a silver tiara sat atop her hair, tied up into a small bun. The upper part of her dress displayed every aspect of Tanya's lithe, toned figure and whilst not entirely revealing, showed off enough of her curves so that each breath she took caused plenty of distractionary movement. A silver pendant hung around her neck and sparkled in the bright light.
<br />
<br />As she approached Rutger, she felt the flowing skirt trailing behind her and hoped she hadn't grown too much since she last wore this. Her shoes were flat in case she had to run and it would be a terrible fashion faux pas if anyone saw them. Shrugging off this minor concern, she laughed at herself helping to deliver her best smile and watched with satisfaction as Rutger's mouth opened again.
<br />
<br />&quot;My, my, lady!&quot; he stammered. &quot;You are simply..beautiful! Words cannot describe what I am looking upon tonight!&quot; he exclaimed. The flattery wasn't necessary, but she was grateful to hear it anyway.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; Tanya said bemused.
<br />
<br />Rutger stared back, then blinked when one of his guards coughed loudly. Tanya heard someone whisper something but said nothing and merely held her smile watching him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh! The mask!&quot; he turned round and opened a case that one of his guards presented. Rutger turned back to face her holding two masks, both were identical, though one was slightly softer in the features. The masks seemed very well made, white in colour and covering the eyes, nose and cheeks, leaving the mouth and chin revealed. A pair of small golden wings to the sides of the mask leant additional cover from someone standing to the side. Tanya appreciated that.
<br />
<br />&quot;May I?&quot; asked Rutger, already stepping around her to fasten the mask to her. She was pleased, having both hands free would be useful, other guests had to hold their mask with one hand. Tanya decided they were more interested in doing other things involving their faces. Rutger expertly clipped the mask into place, Tanya adjusted it until it was comfortable.
<br />
<br />Rutger walked back to face her and looked sad.
<br />
<br />&quot;A shame your beauty must be hidden so, but at least I have a fleeting memory,&quot; he sighed. One of this guards placed a mask over his face and it too was clipped into place.
<br />
<br />He extended an arm, and laughing, Tanya glided over smoothly and took it with one of her own. The guards adopted positions in front and behind them both. From a fold in her skirt, she produced a fan that she snapped open and smiled as light glinted from the metal frame. As they passed a vase, she absently drew the edge of the fan across the flowers, then began to flick the fan back and forth slowly.
<br />
<br />Rutger swallowed.
<br />
<br />&quot;By Sirius, what else do you have tucked away in there?&quot; he asked. Tanya held his gaze, her green eyes shining brightly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wouldn't you like to know?&quot; she whispered.
<br />
<br />Minutes later, a newly-arrived guest watched in fascination as a flower in a vase near the entrance to the ballroom split in two, the head falling to the table. Then another fell, and another.
<br />

			<div class="content">As per usual, you do not disappoint. I especially love the banter between Rutger and Tanya. The action is great too; the pacing is near perfect and your style really makes it seem all the more kinetic.
<br />
<br />I would be remiss if I didn't make a few suggestions though.
<br />
<br />This sentence should change.
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>The driver, clearly very experienced as occasionally he would slip out of a sky lane to take a non-power assisted lane, only to join another sky lane further down.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Is this better?
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>The driver was clearly very experienced. On occasion he would slip smoothly out of a sky lane to take a non-power assisted lane, only to join another sky lane further down.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Whoa! Looooong sentence.
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Minutes later, her worst fears became true, the main door to the church opened suddenly the wind outside had reached a crescendo so she missed the number of people entering the building, then it was shut and the church was still once again.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I'll just make a few minor changes to help the flow...
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Minutes later her worst fears became true and the main door to the church opened. (*optional* Unfortunately for her *optional*) The wind outside had reached a sudden crescendo so she missed the number of people entering the building. Then the door shut and the church was still once more.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Also, don't use &quot;j erk&quot;. It's censored for reasons I still cannot fathom. Try twitch, shudder, snap or any number of other words instead. Clearly context is important but I don't think you'll need any help in choosing the appropriate word.
