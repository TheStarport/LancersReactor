			<div class="content">Hello Peeps,
<br />
<br />Monkey Universe 1.84 was created for us by Black Eagle (again we express our gratitude)
<br />
<br />He modded his Monkeys 1.18 mod into the Monkey Uinverse 1.84.
<br />He added some systems / porsche's shippack / extra commodities and more.
<br />
<br />Now we are going to take the Monkey Universe mod to the next level.
<br />
<br />Here is what we have in store:
<br />
<br /><b>RP clan oriented  </b>
<br />Extra docking rings / bases only dockable by clans ( we will create some new factions that control these bases and reputation editing will make them dockable)
<br />On these bases we will have : clanships / new weapons / extra commodities
<br />
<br /><b>RP freelancer oriented  </b>
<br />A few extra ships
<br />Docking rings on planets who havent got one in the original game
<br />Some extra wrecks and jumpholes
<br />Extra tradelanes
<br />
<br />We have a small modding team who started to work on this but all help is welcome.
<br />If you wanna assist us in this endeavour, please send an e-mail with your modding skills to Gestoord.

			<div class="content">First of all I wanna apologise to have neglected this forum and this post.
<br />
<br />Here is a full update on the current situation of the Monkey Universe mod:
<br />
<br />We had 1.85 up &amp; running since the beginning of this year.
<br />1.85 was completely made by Black Eagle with assistance of the Monkey Universe modding team.
<br />
<br />Since yesterday we released the MU 1.86 mod.
<br />
<br />Due to Black Eagle's RL situations , the 1.86 was mostly done by Triple JH, one of our dedictaed sysadmins.
<br />But Black Eagle was the one who did extensive debugging and assisted us with a lot of stuff.
<br />
<br />Basicly all new bases, systems, addition of the 11 new ships, creation of the new weapons and activation of playerlooting are from his hand.
<br />
<br />The complete reworked commoditymarket and the first (more to follow in the futur) new sound fx for the tractor beam sound and the nomad weapons was made by myself( Gestoord).
<br />
<br />Monkey Universe has become a community project, so a lot of the ideas come from our dedicated player community.
<br />
<br />In th following reply you will find a complete description of the MU 1.86 mod</div>

<br />
<br />by the Monkey Universe Modding Team
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />A small grain of sand in the vast universe...nothing special, just a cluster of stars and some nebulas...just one out of millions of similar places...
<br />
<br />But it was chosen by the Monkey god! The Sirius Sector! A new home for mankind and just interesting enough for our story.
<br />
<br />The first Nomad war is over for several years and people in the colonies forgot about the threat of the Nomads. The governments of the four houses went back to their business and rebuilt what was destroyed in the war. It seems to be a time of peace and economic growth again. But Sirius is in danger! The Nomads are not dead, but even more powerful than before. Pilots disappearing, stations that are attacked out of nowhere, single ships of unknown origin and material that are spotted all over the colonies!
<br />
<br />Mankind is at war once again! The Nomads are back, stronger and more dangerous than before. They already control several systems and operate all over the colonies. However, this time mankind has an ally. The Monkeys from Planet Primus share our aim to destroy the Nomads!
<br />
<br />They have the blessings of the Monkey God and superior knowledge and technology. But the Nomads are strong and victory is still far away.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Enter a new story in the world of Freelancer...
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Join the Monkeys, the Robots and the Order and fight against the enemy of mankind.
<br />
<br />Drive the Nomads out of Sirius!
<br />
<br />- Be a Freelancer, a trader, a fighter or a pirate!
<br />
<br />- Visit a Nomad base and let them take you over. Be one of the superior beings and annihilate the weak! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />- Join a clan and fight for your aims! Get the right to land on one of the Clan bases to buy exclusive clan ships and equipment!
<br />
<br />- Take part in many RP-Events and earn money by finding the Great Banana!
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Simply EXPERIENCE FREELANCER THE &quot;MONKEY WAY&quot;!!!
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />The main aim of this mod is not to change the entire Freelancer universe, but to add some parts to the game to make it more interesting.
<br />
<br />We also changed some of the original features to make the game more challenging. As we wanted to keep the original Freelancer feeling we tried to add things that really fit in the Freelancer universe. However these are our ideas of a &quot;better&quot; Freelancer and you may not like them.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />FEATURES:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- 3 new factions (Monkeys, Robots, Mercenaries) and two story-only factions fully integrated (Order, Nomads). These five factions have their own systems, bases, ships and equipment. They fight each other and tell their interesting history in custom rumors, custom news and infocards.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- 37 totally new ships (4 LFs, 2 HF, 22 VHFs, 2 Frs, 3 Capitals, 4 Clanships) and 5 original FL ships made flyable (CSV, Adv. CSV, Starblazer, Juni's Defender, Red Dragon).
<br />
<br />These ships belong to different factions and are well balanced. This should provide some variety in space <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Nomad Fighter made flyable for the Nomad Clan.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- 6 totally new systems (4 Nomadworld systems, in which the new factions are fighting each other and 1 Clan system and new Outcast system) and all the story-only systems (7) were reworked and made accessable. All these systems are fully with bases, tradelanes, nebulas, asteroid fields, missions, encounters, wrecks and some of them with some specialties.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- New commodity market with 46 new commodities 25 of them contraband). Many new profitable traderoutes for traders and smugglers. Beware, the police and Navy scan you for contraband more often and also some other factions will do this now. The cargospace of all freighters were increased to make trading even more profitable, but beware it is also more dangerous! (MANY THANKS TO SPASTICFROG, who spend lots of time to rework the whole market for good traderoutes!!!)
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Pilots added to the loadouts of every ship. Every destroyed NPC-ship leaves a pilot, which you can sell for much money.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- New equipment and weapons added to the game. Shield-Weapon relations reworked.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Clan stuff: A Clansystem, with Clanbases. On these bases you can buy exclusive Clanships (exclusive equipment in the future <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- NPCs are more challenging. Their shields regenerate, their loadouts were improved (stronger weapons, cruisedisruptors, etc.) and they use Nanobots and Shield batteries.
<br />
<br />Also their maneuovering capabilities were improved and they use Torpedoes against Capitalships.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Added a new Hyperlane for the Nomads. This is an improved Nomad version of the tradelane.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Scanners, Tractor Beams and Armor Upgrades are buyable all over Sirius.
<br />
<br />Several new thrusters were also added.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Different Speeds and cruise-charge-times for the different shipclasses (LFs: 120 mph, 3 sec; HFs: 100 mph, 4 sec; VHFs: 90 mph, 5 sec; Frs: 80 mph, 6 sec).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />- Added several logical jumpholes to the mod (e.g.: Magellan --&gt; Omega 3) and the jumptunnels have different colors (Liberty = Blue, Bretonia = Brown, Kusari = Red, Rheinland = Green, Independent Worlds = Yellow, Omicron Alpha and Gamma = Black, Nomad Worlds = Pink).
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- New Menu Backgrounds in the main menu.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Added Capitalship encounters in the house systems and some pirate systems.
<br />
<br />Other encounters reworked.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Changed Trents appearance.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Cruisespeed is now 450 mph
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Prices of the ships increased.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- New sounds and new music added and also some new weapon graphics and sounds added.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- All original FL bugs were fixed and the Unofficial Freelancer SP Patch 1.4 (by Buck Danny) was added.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Randommissions are payed better now and you get more often station/battleship destroy missions (also against the Nomads).
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- You start neutral to everyone (only enemy are the Nomads) and with 120,000 credits.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Levels up to 90 in MP
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />- Added some bases from the sponsorship program (look on the website for more about this program).
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />VERSION HISTORY:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Version 1.86:
<br />
<br />- 11 new ships (1LF, 1HF, and 9VHFs).
<br />
<br />- Some new music and weapon sounds were added.
<br />
<br />- Some new bases and a system was added from the sponsorship program.
<br />
<br />- Two destructable bases were added to the canada system for roleplay events.
<br />
<br />- Commodity Market reworked.
<br />
<br />- Nomad clan base added to canada system.
<br />
<br />- Added some new weapons and equipment.
<br />
<br />- Reworked the coded weapons to be more comparable to Monkey and Nomad weapons.
<br />
<br />- New Monkey and Robot planets added.
<br />
<br />- Added Nomad Ice Prison in Dyson Sphere.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Version 1.85:
<br />
<br />- Parts of the Monkey Universe 1.84 code were removed, others were reworked.
<br />
<br />- A new faction, the Mercenaries, who are normally taking missions from everyone against everyone. Their only real enemies are the Nomads and they are therefore allied with the Monkeys, the Robots and the Order.
<br />
<br />- All Story-only systems were reworked.
<br />
<br />- The Nomads now use Hyperlanes in Nomadia (for now this is implemented on trial-basis).
<br />
<br />- Some new bases from the sponsorshipprogram were added.
<br />
<br />- A Clansystem, with four clanbases was added (one for lawful, unlawful, trader and mercenary clans). These bases are owned by the new clanfactions, which are enemies to every player except of the clan players of the specific clan.
<br />
<br />- 15 new ships for different factions were added (2 Freighters, 1 LF, 1 HF and 11 VHFs).
<br />
<br />- Some new music was added.
<br />
<br />Fixed Bugs and Mistakes:
<br />
<br />- Some small bugs in mbases.ini where fixed.
<br />
<br />- Other small bugs (like spelling mistakes) were fixed and many console errors in MP were solved.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Remaining Bugs:
<br />
<br />- Nomad capitalships will sometimes dissappear as if they were cloaking, although they do not have a cloak. This will only happen, if you are far away from the ships. As far as I know, this problem could not be solved by anyone until now. But it is very rare.
<br />
<br />- The jumptunnel of the jumphole to the Dyson Sphere System is not working totally right. At the beginning of the jump, you are flying outside the tunnel.
<br />
<br />- If you set the best path in Canada (Clan system) from north to south or from south to north, you get only one waypoint and the setting does not use the tradelanes. This appears, if the path crosses the middle horizontal axis of the system.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />&quot;The Monkeys 1.18&quot;:
<br />
<br />- Added the Tradelane Disruptors made by kaegogoi. There are two versions:
<br />
<br />one legal and one illegal version. They are buyable on the house planets, research stations and on pirate bases. Be careful, the police and the Navy of the four houses will scan you for the illegal version and you can't drop a weapon!
<br />
<br />- Added all the Improvements of the unofficial Freelancer SP Patch 1.4, which corrects many small bugs in FL (e.g.: unknown objects, or jumpholes not displayed on the Navmap).
<br />
<br />Many thanks to Buck Danny for this great package!
<br />
<br />- Nomad shields are now an own shield class (like Graviton, Positron and Molecular). All the normal weapons, such as Lasers, Tachyons, etc. do less damage to these Nomad Pulsar shields.
<br />
<br />- The weapons of the Monkeys and the Robots have their own characteristics now. Monkey weapons have the characteristics of the colony weapons, except of doing much damage to Nomad Pulsar shields. Robot weapons do more damage to all the normal shields and less damage to Nomad shields.
<br />
<br />- Added a new Nomad VHF, the Nomad Mystere. It is stronger than the Valkyrie N1, but therefore has a smaller cargospace and a slow speed.
<br />
<br />- Added a new home system for the Robots. It has four bases, nebulas, tradelanes, wrecks, etc..
<br />
<br />- Changed the damage done by the capitalship weapons of the four houses. Now it is really challenging to fight battleships with Light or Heavy Fighters (The story battleships still have the same weak weapons, so that it is not impossible to do the missions).
<br />
<br />- Added two flyable capitalships. A Monkey and a Robot Destroyer. These ships are sold on the capitals of the two factions. They are very strong, but therefore also very expensive.
<br />
<br />- You now sometimes get missions from the monkeys, the robots and the order, in which you have to destroy Nomad Battleships and weapon platforms.
<br />
<br />- Added a Liberty Gunboat (model from Excelcia Mod), which can be seen in Liberty space and around Planet Malta.
<br />
<br />- Added Pilots for every faction. If you kill an enemy, the pilot will now eject, so that you can tractor in his lifepod and sell it on a base. Every faction got it's own pilots and there are also special pilots for capitalships. If you want to make as much profit as possible, try to think logically. An Outcast pilot will bring you a high reward, if you sell him to the Outcasts (best Planet Malta), the Corsairs (they are the enemies of the Outcasts), or the Liberty Navy. If you sell him to the Rheinland Military 
<br />you will not get such a high reward.
<br />
<br />- Added 47 new commodities to the game. 25 of these commodities are contraband, so that smuggling is now much more interesting. Be careful, the Navy and some pirates scan you more often and the Bounty Hunters also scan for some contraband.
<br />
<br />- I added a new projectile for the Nomad VHF Turret. This pink beam fits better than the green Rheinland beam.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Fixes from version 1.1:
<br />
<br />- The class seven hardpoints of the guardian were misplaced. Now two of them are on the wings and one is on top of the ship.
<br />
<br />- Some of the new ships with custom models disappeared, when the center was out of screen. I fixed this with FL ModelTool (Many thanks to Anton!).
<br />
<br />- The new shields had the hit effects of positron shields, although they are Graviton shields. I fixed this, so that they have the hit effects of Graviton shields (Only the Nomad shield has the positron effects, because it is a Pulsar shield. Sorry new effects for this new shield type are impossible to do, at least for me).
<br />
<br />- Changed the color of the Heavy Molecular Tractor Beam from yellow to red. I think this looks better.
<br />
<br />- The Conqueror has now two torpedo/cruisedisruptor hardpoints to make it a better alternative to the Anubis MK2.
<br />
<br />- The mission consigners of the Monkeys and the Robots are now also Monkeys and Robots.
<br />
<br />- The names of the Shipdealer and the Commoditydealer on the Nomad outpost were mixed up. Now they have the right names.
<br />
<br />- Some of the system lights in the new systems were missing or misplaced and the second sun in Unknown 2 had no death zone. Now, every sun has a light source and a death zone.
<br />
<br />- The Nomad Cruise-Disruptor Launcher and the Nomad Torpedo Launcher had no weapon models. Now they have.
<br />
<br />- I finally managed to make the Nomad outpost show up in the trade list. Now every of the new stations will show up in the trade list of a commodity.
<br />
<br />- All NPCs carry less nanobots and shield batteries. In the last version the fights took very long and could be boring after some time. Now they should be shorter, but still challenging. Normally the NPCs now have bats/bots to rebuild their whole shield two times (before 3-4 times) and the hull 1-2 times (before 3-5 times). Freighters still have more bots/bats than other ships, due to their lack of mobility and their size (easy to hit). Also the Nomads, the Robots and the Monkeys got a bit more bots and bats than the pilots of other factions (but still less than before). I hope this makes the game more fun and maybe a bit easier, but still challenging.
<br />
<br />- There were some problems with the sur file of the Anubis MK2. I fixed this with a new sur file.
<br />
<br />- Several small bugs and one major bug (Leeds system not accessible) from the first release of version 1.18 were fixed.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Version 1.1:
<br />
<br />- Added two new factions, The Monkeys and The Robots with their bases in the bottom Unknown system. Each of them with several new ships (LF, VHF, FR), new equipment (weapons, thrusters, shields, etc.), rumors, news, etc (The history of the Monkeys and the Robots may be interesting for you, if you want to know more about the Nomads. 
<br />However these are only my own ideas). Together with the Order they fight the Nomads (There are many encounters, patrols and trade paths of the Monkeys and the Robots in the Nomad 1 system, in the bottom Unknown system and in Omicron Gamma).
<br />
<br />- The Order and the Nomads are now also showing up after you completed the story.
<br />
<br />Battleship Osiris was moved to the top Unknown system and there is also a new Nomad system with a Nomad base and a Monkey base (reach it from the Unknown systems). The Order and the Nomads both got a new VHF and their own new equipment, etc. (The Order and the Nomads also have many encounters, even with capitalships).
<br />
<br />- The NPCs are now more challenging, because their loadouts were improved (better equipment, etc.) and there shields now regenerate. They also use nanobots and shieldbatteries. The most challenging pilots are the Monkeys and the Robots.
<br />
<br />- Added several new ships: - The CSV and the Advanced CSV, as fast Freighters for pirates.
<br />
<br />The Defender, which Juni flies during the story, as a new Liberty Heavy Fighter.
<br />
<br />The Red Dragon, which is flown by the Blood Dragons, as an improved version of the Kusari Dragon.
<br />
<br />The missing Starblazer Civilian Light Fighter.
<br />
<br />- Added some new equipment, buyable all over Sirius. Scanners (3), Tractor Beams (2) and Armor Upgrades (5).
<br />
<br />- The different shipclasses have now different speeds and cruise charge times:
<br />
<br />Light Fighters (120 mph; 3 sec)
<br />
<br />Heavy Fighters (100 mph; 4 sec)
<br />
<br />Very Heavy Fighters (90 mph; 5 sec)
<br />
<br />Freighters (80 mph; 6 sec)
<br />
<br />- Pirate and Bounty Hunter ships have faster engines (normally 10 mph more).
<br />
<br />- The Monkey, Robot and Nomad ships are also faster than other ships of their class.
<br />
<br />- The two different CSVs and the Starblazer are also faster than other ships of their class.
<br />
<br />- Added some logical jumpholes in likely positions (e.g.: Magellan --&gt; Omega 3). The jumptunnels now have different colors (Liberty = Blue; Bretonia = Brown; Kusari = Red; Rheinland = Green; Independent Worlds = Yellow; Ommicron Gamma and Alpha = black; Unknown systems = Pink).
<br />
<br />- I changed two of the Intros in the Main Menu and enabled the hidden waterworld intro.
<br />
<br />There is also some new music for the intros and the Unknown systems.
<br />
<br />- Added Missions against the Nomads (much more than in version 1.0).
<br />
<br />- Added Capitalship Encounters in the house systems and in some pirates systems.
<br />
<br />- Changed Trents look.
<br />
<br />- The Monkeys and the Robots are now also firing torpedoes on the Nomad capitalships.
<br />
<br />- Cruisespeed is now 450 mph (Or whatever the unit is).
<br />
<br />- All ships cost more.
<br />
<br />- When you start a new Multiplayer game you are neutral to everyone except of the Monkeys, the Robots, the Order and the Nomads.
<br />
<br />- All shields (NPC and player) are now stronger.
<br />
<br />- Some of the Nomad VHFs fire Nomad torpedoes on their enemies.
<br />
<br />- The Piranha, the CSV and the Banshee are now buyable during the story to have more ships to choose from.
<br />
<br />- Added new news pictures for the new factions.
<br />
<br />- Increased the cargospace of all freighters.
<br />
<br />- Increased the powerdrain of all thrusters and lowered the speed of the normal version, the deluxe version and the heavy version.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Fixes from version 1.0:
<br />
<br />- The player's ship now really has enginetrails (sorry forgot that for the most ships).
<br />
<br />- The names of the Monkeys, the Robots, the Order and the Nomads now appear in Mission texts. MANY THANKS FOR THIS TO CHIPS!!!
<br />
<br />- Edited and fixed some infocards.
<br />
<br />- Changed some sounds and graphics (Weapons).
<br />
<br />- Battleship Osiris will now also show up in the tradelist.
<br />
<br />- The torpedoes on the Anubis MK2 can now only fire forward.
