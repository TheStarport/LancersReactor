			<div class="content">i've been looking around the forums and i did find a few interesting things about editing existing weapons and equipments.
<br />
<br />but what i want to know is, how can i CREATE my own, say, beam weapon (NOT missile/torpedo launcher of any sort), that is NOT the modified Justice MK1 and make it able to be sold in different stations/planets? (i was aiming, for example, in a few stations in kusari and britonia as well as new york's manhattan and fort bush, and several places in the california system.. also, how can i make these new weapons/equipments be sold in every docking station or planet from ONE given faction?)
<br />
<br />also, is it possible to create a type of &quot;gravity&quot; weapon/equipment that does not specifically does damage, but holds, pulls, or pushes an objet/ship towards/away from the player? (for each different reaction i would assume i'd need to create 3 different types of equipment for each effects..?)
<br />
<br />further, what files do i edit in order to create these weapons/equipments?
<br />
<br />furtherMORE, where could i find the &quot;nicknames&quot; of weapons and ships? i wanted to edit the Drail weapon, but i cannot find it in the weapon_good.ini file... 
<br />
<br />how can i make the ships that are hunting you down follow you through jump gates, trade lanes, etc.? in addition to this question, how can i enable the function to enter in formation with hostiles?
<br />
<br />one last question for now, how can i create an entirely new faction? i was planning on creating this faction that uses &quot;stolen&quot; ships from pretty much all other factions, that when you kill them, your status would become better with all other factions because of their thievery. also, would be useful to create another entirely new faction with their own ships specialized in hunting this &quot;thief&quot; faction, which when killed, the player's stats would only change (positively) with this new faction and it would not affect any other factions.
<br />i also wanted to make these 2 factions function within specific given systems.
<br />
<br />does any of this make sense? oO
<br />
<br />i have a few more questions, but i'll leave them for later. i can already see i asked way too much already... and the more i type, the more ideas i have. lol ^^;;
<br />
<br />the more detailed information provided, the better, please, including links to sources, and so on.
<br />thank you VERY much in advance.

			<div class="content">to add more pain to your brains. lol
<br />
<br />how can i create a type of shield that the effect is not only to reflect damage from the ship, but also added a special effect to push away objects, such as small ships? (a type of anti-gravity shield)
<br />
<br />that said, how can i create a shield that reflects back the shot towards the same direction it came from? (not bounce off, but send back)
<br />
<br />is it possible, or am i thinking WAY far outside of the box here? lol

			<h3><a href="#p425408" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">If you want to make your own gun, open up data/equipment/weapon_equip.ini and copy the big entry for li_gun01_mark01 - just give it a new nickname (like my_beam_gun, and change the refire_delay to 0.010 or lower (lower means it shoots faster, giving the look of a beam - you can't actually have a real beam weapon).
<br />
<br />Then you need to make it show up on a base. To do this open data/equipment/weapon_good.ini and copy the entry for li_gun01_mark01 again - change both the li_gun01_mark01's to my_beam_gun or whatever the nickname was of your entry in weapon_equip.ini.
<br />
<br />To make it available to buy on a base, open up data/equipment/market_misc.ini and find: 
<br />
<br />[BaseGood
<br />base = Li01_01_base
<br />
<br />This is Planet Manhattan. At the bottom of that little section, add this line:
<br />
<br />MarketGood = my_beam_weapon, -1, -1, 10, 10, 0, 1
<br />
<br />So now you can buy your gun at Planet Manhattan - it will look like the Justice Mk I, but it will shoot a lot faster. You can mess around with it and change the stats later.
<br />
<br />All nicknames for weapons are stored in data/equipment/weapon_equip.ini (the stats are in this file) and data/equipment/weapon_good.ini (the base icons are here so you can buy them).
<br />
<br />Market_misc.ini tells you where the gun (the nickname from weapon_good.ini) is sold. You can't set a faction for a gun - meaning you can't say that only Corsairs can sell the gun (unless you put it on bases that the Corsairs run).
<br />
<br />All ship nicknames and stats are stored in data/ships/shiparch.ini. 
<br />
<br />Gravity isn't possible, so you can't make things bounce or deflect to/away from anything. 
<br />
<br />How can you make ships that follow you through jumpgates? You can't. The closest you can come is with the &quot;NPC Wingmen&quot; mod (search for it).
<br />
<br />You can't form with ships you are hostile to, it just doesn't work. No way to change it.
<br />
<br />To make a new faction, well...there's a tutorial on it - try looking in the tutorials forum. Basically, clone another faction (ie, copy it's info in data/missions/faction_prop.ini and give it a new nickname) and take some npc_ship entries from other factions. 
<br />
<br />To make them show up in space you'll have to add encounters in the systems you want to see them in. 
<br />
<br />In response to your second post, no, there is no way to make shots deflect back to where they came from. Be nice if you could, but ya can't <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />If you have problems with making you gun, there are some weapon creation tutorials in the tutorials forum - just look a little bit for them.</div>

			<div class="content">thanks ogu for all the info <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />im gonna start on making my new gun immediately
<br />
<br />how can i make it so when i kill that new faction, other factions would be happy/unhappy about it?
<br />
<br />also, how do i change my new gun's price? o_&lt; i've been searching for the fabled &quot;price&quot; but i cant seem to find a working pattern for it... some have it, some dont o_o
<br />
<br />its really bad that i cant make those modifications tho... it'd be interesting if i could ^^
<br />
<br />ah. one last question. how can i make the booster (tab key) faster than 400?
<br />i already managed to, somehow, make my &quot;warp&quot; speed faster to 750 (most stable speed i found.. anything above it is way too fast for the game physics, it seems... its the best speed i found to use &quot;warp&quot; inside meteor fields)
<br />
<br />sry. one LAST question. how can i change the charge time for the booster? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />its way too slow and by the time it activates i already dropped all my counter measures.... lol
<br />
<br />edit: i remember seeing a mod for it once, but it only seems to work on one specific ship. namely, the nomad fighter. it charges in 1 or 2 seconds while other ships charge in up to 5 or 7 seconds.... needless to say, due to the lack of shields on the nomad fighter, i disabled that mod.
<br />
<br />thanks again for the response ogu

			<div class="content">&quot;How can I make it so when I kill that new faction, other factions would be happy/unhappy about it?&quot; 
<br />
<br />That would be the empanthy.ini take a look it is self-explanatory if not post back and I or someone will help you out.
<br />
<br />&quot;How do I change my new gun's price?&quot;
<br />
<br />That would be in weapons_good.ini also self-explanatory if not post back and someone or I will help you out. Look for this price = ????? Moreover, change it to what you would like for every weapon, missile, &amp; mine.
<br />
<br />&quot;How can I make the booster (tab key) faster than 400?&quot;
<br />
<br />I take it you mean thruster right? If so that would be in the st_equip.ini look for max_force = ?????? In addition, change it to max_force = 240000 remember it is the speed you want? X 600 = the force you need&#8230;
<br />
<br />I hope this helps and if I am wrong someone correct me please.
