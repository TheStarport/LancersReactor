			<div class="content">Hi, I was on this forum a year ago and now I come back. This little guide is for people who aren't very good at Freelancer or who just wants to know a bit more about this game. I'll start with the least deadly to most deadly areas of space.
<br />
<br />Liberty Space- This is where you start the SP campaign. This area of space is not very deadly because the pirates use cheap fighters and cheap weapons. However, you do have to worry about being ambushed by pirates when you are in a tradelane, especially if you are using a weak ship like the Starflier or the Patriot.
<br />
<br />Bretonia Space- This is a bit more serious than Liberty. There are more pirates and terrorists and they are better equipped. Use a decent ship like the Liberty Heavy Fighter &quot;Defender&quot; or the Bretonian fighters and you wouldn't have too much trouble in these systems.
<br />
<br />Kusari Space- There are not many pirates in Kusari, but they are well equipped. A heavy fighter like the Bretonian &quot;Crusader&quot; or any of the Kusari ships will make it much easier to fly through these systems. 
<br />
<br />The Independent Worlds- These systems connect Liberty to the other colonies. They are outside the control of the colonies. Pirates are a common sight here. They use Heavy Fighters and powerful weapons and ambush everything that flies through the Tradelanes. The Kusari Heavy Fighter &quot;Dragon&quot; or Bounty Hunter Heavy Fighter &quot;Barracuda&quot; will help you against these pirates.
<br />
<br />Rheinland Space- Even if this is a colony, don't expect pirates to be in small numbers. Rheinland technology is very advanced, and their ships are some of the best in the game, but that comes with a corresponding crime/terrorism rate. Be aware of your surroundings and use a Rheinland ship or a Border Worlds Heavy Fighter &quot;Stiletto&quot; when you are flying through these systems. There are many terrorists and pirates here.
<br />
<br />The Border Worlds- These systems connect Rheinland, Kusari, and Bretonia. Pirate activity is very high in these systems, and some of them have no tradelanes or can only be accessed by Jump Holes. The most dangerous of these are the Omega-5 and Tau-23. Omega 5 is a war zone. The Red Hessian and Corsair Pirates are everywhere, killing each other. Tau-23 is full of radiation and Outcast Pirates. Use a Rheinland Heavy Fighter &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, or if you have the money, a Bounty Hunter Very Heavy Fighter &quot;Hammerhead&quot;. These systems are outside the colonial control. They are very dangerous.
<br />
<br />The Edge Worlds- These systems are full of Very Heavy Fighters and crazy pirates. These systems include the Corsair and Outcast home worlds, all of the Omicron systems, Omega-41, and Tau-37. These systems are plagued by toxic radiation, the lack of trade lanes and jump gates, and the lack of any control over the pirates. Use a Very Heavy Fighter of your own and become friendly with the pirates, or at least neutral. This will save you from having a hard time and getting hit with cruise disruptors <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />The Unknown Systems- These systems are found via Jump Holes in the Northeastern part of the Omicron Gamma System and Omicron Alpha system. Do not enter these systems unless you are sure your ship can handle immense amounts of damage. The Nomad aliens dominate these systems and destroy everything in their path. If you have the best ship with the best weapons, try and kill them, you can salvage their weapons. They inflict HUGE amounts of damage and use no energy.
<br />
<br />I also have some valuble information for when you're getting your ass kicked by pirates! There is a very good tactic of using your thrusters before shooting a missile. If you shoot the missile while you are using your thrusters, it hits very hard (if it hits your target at all). When I use it, however, it does not affect shields much, but I did that with a Starkiller torpedo and it took out 80% of a Titan's hull. You can use cheap missiles like that and they will cause serious damage to hulls.
