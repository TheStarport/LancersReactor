			<div class="content">If I wanted to, I could sit with my electronic companions forever in this freighter, but there was one of us that needed sustanence. There were very little rations left, and Jennifer's crippled state required nourishment. There were very little stations still running, but the old Z-Axis shipyards were still running, albeit with a much smaller crew. My battered old Rhino freighter was cleared for docking, and I proceeded to land. Two old friends of mine greeted me on my arrival. It was Anatoly, and his younger brother Aleksei. These two had founded Z-Axis after being rejected by the Navy Design Labs. Warm greetings were shared around and I explained my state.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, you finally used Daedalus? Really, I should slap you for doing that, but now is not the time.&quot; Anatoly said with a sincere tone. &quot;I also may have something to replace that battered old Rhino, if you want it, that is...&quot;
<br />
<br />I told him I would think about it, but I had more pressing issues to attend to, like the fact that Jennifer Aida was unconcious in my ship. Aleksei ran to the med bay and retrieved a float stretcher and moved Jennifer's battered body to the station's infirmary. I went through what happened in Tau-37 with Anatoly over dinner, and it was then I realised that the flesh in my system still needed nourishment from food, and that i would die after a long peirod without rations. At least I was still human, still somewhat bound by a mortal chain to this life. Aleksei had told me that Jennifer would require a fair bit of work, and that it probably be best if she stayed here when I left. Anatoly was also interested in the AI in my Rhino. He wanted to use it in a new ship he was designing, a light fighter to surpass the Reflex. A fighter which could help the pilot in avoiding accidents and missiles fater than a human could. I talked to Helena (who resided in my Rhino) and she agreed, and agreed to duplicating her neural pattern a couple of times. It was a way of sustaining immortality, of living forever, in a small way.
<br />
<br />Aleksei had left Jennifer in the capable hands of the station's doctor, who had his left arm missing, and had grafted in a mechanical replacement. He was one of the Z-Axis engineers who had helped me build Daedalus, and was one of four, including me, who knew what it truly was. (other than Arania, but he did not know what it's true power was.)
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />Before me stood the fruit of Z-Axis' latest efforts before the Dom'Kavash incident, The ZX-513 Doomtrain. Bigger than my old Rhino, It was graced with yellow and black bands along the sharp edges down the hull. It was somwhat triangular in shape, but it had the points cut off at certain points. The cockpit was large enough to hold two pilots, yet the overall package was just small  enough to fit in most docking bays, well, in all standard docking bays. This was the prototype, and again, Anatoly had offered it to me as part of a 'test'. I was amazed he would after what happened to the lat wo prototypes he let me use for 'testing'. But Anatoly would hear nothing of it, saying that I tested how well they could handle damage. There was no talking him out of his decisions, not that there was anything wrong with that at times. But the other decision of his I seriously wanted to talk him out of. He wanted to come with me, as an escort, to test his new heavy fighter. Of course I'd like an escort, but I wasn't going to have him risk his life over little old me. I told him why, and explained exactly what I was going to do, and for the first time in history, someone had changed a Korenchkin's mind. Besides, his wife would kill him, and I didn't want to have to break the news to her.
<br />
<br />I loaded up my new ship with the equipment from my old Rhino, and equipped some of the more advanced weapons on the mounts. Aleksei had some of the Z-Axis guys equip my ship with some of the new turrets that they had developed. With my new arsenal, I plugged A.K. into the I/O port in the cockpit and left Jennifer and Helena behind, following on a rumor of the whereabout of my relative Arania. The nets had reported him last in the bar on Planet Harris. Luckily I was on the Tau-23 depot of Z-Axis, and not in Bering. It would have been a much longer trip otherwise...
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />Arania was confronted by a man I recognised, but I couldn't put my finger on where I had seen him before. I decided to exercise some of my power. I opened a channel to Arania's Anubis, and broadcast myself down to the planet. In a swirl of light and heat, I rematerialised in front of the mysterious stranger, leaving him with a slack jaw and many questions.
<br />

			<div class="content">IC:
<br />Before I could speak i realised that this was not Arania, but someone else. As quick as a flash, I returned to the Doomtrain via a brilliant beam of light, moving my mass high into space. I returned to a physical form, and collapsed. A shimmering form hovered over my head.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn, I must be hallucinating. I think I need to lay off the transporting for a while. Not good for the 'ole body.&quot;
<br />
<br />The floating form took shape. It was a dragon of some form, with a slender body and magnificent wings spreading out from joints at the shoulders. It looked more like a bird than a dragon, but it had distinctive reptillian features like front arms and a dragon-like head. It swooped over my head, and landed on top of a cargo container.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm never f***ing transporting again if I'm gonna see this s***.&quot;
<br />
<br />The dragon looked closer at me, and to my surprise, spoke in a clear voice.
<br />
<br />&quot;You have met the one called Arania?&quot;
<br />
<br />Now I was about relieve myself in my pants. This hallucination was talking to me!
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm not gonna listen to you, you're not real!&quot; I yelled at the thing.
<br />&quot;Quite the contrary, I am real, I just have hidden myself from you for some time, as your mind would not be able to comprehend my exsistance.&quot;
<br />
<br />I was about to put my hands over my ears when A.K. beeped wildly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Another being on this ship! Where?&quot;
<br />
<br />A.K. beeped again. It was on the cargo container. The same cargo container where this thing was.
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay, you're real. And you have 30 seconds to explain yourself.&quot;
<br />&quot;As I said, you have met Arania, correct?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yeah, so what about him?&quot;
<br />&quot;There were certain things about you that were shared, including certain abilities and traits.&quot;
<br />&quot;Purity and goodness, so?&quot;
<br />&quot;Arania has a Phoenix-D&#230;mon called Araminta.&quot;
<br />
<br />The answer struck me like a tonne of bricks.
<br />
<br />&quot;You are my D&#230;mon?&quot; I asked
<br />&quot;Correct. As of yet, I have no name, but if you wish, you may name me before I name myself.&quot;
<br />
<br />I thought long and hard about what to call my new d&#230;mon. Many possibilities formed in my mind, but one stuck.
<br />
<br />&quot;I've decided.&quot;
<br />&quot;I pray that it is good.&quot;
<br />&quot;You carry my sarcasm too? Thats good to hear.&quot;
<br />&quot;Glad you like it. The name?&quot;
<br />&quot;Alexander.&quot;
<br />
<br />The D&#230;mon thought about it. Well it seemed to anyway.
<br />
<br />&quot;That seems acceptable.&quot;
<br />
<br />I got up off the cold floor of the cargo hold and made my way to the cockpit. Alexander followed me, landing on the headrest of the co-pilot's seat. It shuffled around a bit before taking off again to land on the console in front of me. I took a good look at it. I had blue-grey scales everywhere except under it's wings, which glittered a deep ruby color. For a dragon, it looked kinda cool. I flicked the engines into life and headed for Tau-23. I wanted to show someone my new pet.
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />On the Z-Axis fighter plant in Tau-23, Aleksei was unconcious on the floor with Anatoly hiding behind a crate. Alexander nibbled at Aleksei's fingers.
<br />
<br />&quot;Get away from there! Leave his fingers alone!&quot; I yelled at Alexander. 
<br />Anatoly peeked out from behind the crate.
<br />
<br />&quot;You control that thing?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yup. Alexander, meet Anatoly Korenchkin, owner of Z-Axis.&quot;
<br />&quot;Greetings Anatoly.&quot; Alexander said in a clear tone. &quot;Sorry about the scare.&quot;
<br />
<br />Anatoly almost fainted himself after hearing it talk.
<br />
<br />&quot;Look, I need to find someone. I know where to find him, but I can't get there.&quot;
<br />
<br />Anatoly steadied himself on a crate.
<br />
<br />&quot;Where do you need to go?&quot;
<br />&quot;Sol.&quot;
<br />
<br />Anatoly almost fainted again.
<br />
<br />&quot;SOL! YOU WANT TO GET TO SOL!!! WHAT THE F*** IS IN SOL!!!&quot; Anatoly was clearly upset.
<br />
<br />&quot;A relative. Someone who can answer my questions.&quot;
<br />
<br />Anatoly pondered this for a bit.
<br />
<br />&quot;Come with me. I'm gonna need a drink after this.&quot;
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br />In front of me floated a small fighter, sleek in it's design, but with an aggresive haunched look. Branded on the side was a single word: Helena. Anatoly always thought of good names for his ships, but I knew where this one came from.
<br />
<br />&quot;You finished it? That was quick...&quot;
<br />&quot;I've had the structure done for a while. I just needed to tweak the AI and the Jump Drive.&quot;
<br />
<br />I was flummoxed by that revalation
<br />
<br />&quot;J-J-Jump Drive?&quot;
<br />&quot;From a Dom'Kavash Fighter floating past. One man's trash is another's treasure! Waste not, want not!&quot;
<br />
<br />Alexander poked around the open cockpit. It pushed a few buttons, seeing the reactions on the screen.
<br />
<br />&quot;Get out of there!&quot; Anatoly yelled.
<br />&quot;I was just checking...&quot; Alexander said sheepishly.
<br />
<br />This thing carried my curiosity too.
<br />
<br />&quot;Look Anatoly, does it work? Cos I need to find this guy fast.&quot;
<br />&quot;All tests and simulations are positive. I havent tested it yet, though...&quot;
<br />&quot;Thats where I come in.&quot;
<br />
<br />I ran over to the control pad in front of the ship. I started to launch sequence by moving the ship to the landing pad. I followed the ship in its journey to the doors.
<br />
<br />&quot;Jake, I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea if this is gonna work or not. Jennifer only got the Nomad power supply installed an hour ago. I don't know if this will work...&quot;
<br />&quot;Anatoly?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />&quot;Trust me. Trust your own work. Think of it as a test flight, as if I'm testing it's functionality. A trip to Sol seems like a good place to start.&quot;
<br />
<br />Anatoly thought about this for a brief moment.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bring me back another Dom'Kavash Jump Drive.&quot;
<br />
<br />With that I climbed into the cockpit and called to Alexander to join me. I said one last thing to Anatoly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Fate is one cold-hearted b****. One moment she grants you unmeasurable luck, and in a flash she kcufs you up like cardimine. But thats the kinda girl we both like: A challenge to conquer.&quot;
<br />&quot;Amen Jake. Godspeed.&quot;
<br />&quot;God can't help me. He's in Sol.&quot;
<br />
<br />Anatoly laughed nervously.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do me a favour, Anatoly.&quot;
<br />&quot;What's that.&quot;
<br />
<br />I threw down a bracelet.
<br />
<br />&quot;Give this to Jennifer. It belonged to her mother.&quot;
<br />&quot;Can do.&quot;
<br />
<br />I sealed the cockpit, and took off through the open door. Outside I lined up with the main sun in the Sol system. The time had come to travel once again. I hit the Jump drive and lurched into the unknown.
<br />For once I had found something that very few from Sirius had even remembered.
<br />
<br />Earth.

			<div class="content">The two figures stood shocked on the tarmac. Some guy had just appeared and gone. Waalbeck knew for sure that there was no cloaking device for personal use. He also realised that this wasn't Arania. The trader just shook his head and turned back towards the bar muttering he wasn't drunk enough. Waalbeck had an idea that it was probably one of those strange people Arania was with, computer pyscho thingies. He didn't think about it too much, it just seemed to far out with reality. He sighed. He walked back to the bar and grabbed a Sidewinder Fang, the ever popular drink with these Bretonian types. The bartender was an older man, with close cropped graying hair and piercing eyes and rather pale skin. He seemed to powerful to be some old bartender. In fact, he didn't look familiar at all. And bartenders don't change overnight. He walked over to Waalbeck and said. &quot;Comrade? You want to help your people yes?&quot; Waalbeck looked up. He didn't know how this pale man with the strange heavy accent knew about his problem but he decided to go along with it. &quot;Whatsit to you?&quot; he asked uncertainly. The bartender looked around. &quot;Come with me comrade, I get you soldiers who can help you people&quot;. As he dragged Waalbeck to the backroom with a surprisingly strong grip Waalbeck protested. &quot;If you mean mercenaries I havn't got any more credits&quot; Still the old man pulled. Then when they were at the back of the storage cupboard he stopped. Waalbeck protested again &quot;I don't see what any of thi....&quot; Whack!
<br />
<br />He woke up groggily on a small bed. &quot;Uhh...&quot; was all he could say. He was in a med-room of some kind of high tech ship. He sat up and swung his legs off the bed and onto the ground. Then a small buzz sounded. Almost immediatly, several high rank looking Officers and some lowly grunts entered. Waalbeck groaned. Coalition. The Officers all began talking their own language and a technician stepped forward to translate.
<br />
<br />&quot;So...I'm the commander of evacuation right?&quot; asked Waalbeck. He received nods from the officers. &quot;And my job is to get everyone in the Sirius....out of the Sirius.&quot; The technician translated and the officers nodded emphatically. Waalbeck rubbed his forehead. &quot;And how am I, one former Commander of the Rheinland forces,&quot; he paused. Rheinland seemed strange to say. Then he carried on. &quot;..ah the Rheinland forces who attacked most of the Sirius to listen to me and leave the Sirius for good?&quot; The technician relayed that back and after several minutes got an answer. &quot;Because comrade, if they don't, they will all die. And most of you Alliance lackeys seem to have a fear of dying. It has already been proven in the southern systems and it is the Northen ones we seem to have trouble getting them to come. You have one week to create a mass exodus or the people of the Northern Sirius will be left to die.&quot; Waalbeck paused. &quot;Why exactly are we going to die if we don't leave?&quot; The technician hesitated then translated. The officers stared at Waalbeck for awhile but eventually let a reason go. The technician looked at the officers for comfirmation. They nodded. &quot;Well...because we are taking you back to our worlds, which are much more highly advanced and as soon as we leave, an doomsday device will be set off, triggering a chain reaction explosion of all the suns in the Sirius, and there will be, at the same time chemical free agents released from all the stations in the Sirius, mixing with the sun explosions and filling it with dark matter radiation clouds.&quot; The officers grinned at eachover and said more as the technician began realying again. &quot;If tampered with, the chemicals will instead release themselves onto the nearest stellar body or station. Possibly less devastation then the planned explosions, but crippling none-the-less.&quot; &quot;How secret is this plan?&quot; Waalbeck asked. The officers waited for the translation and then replied back. &quot;As of now, all of us in the room are the ones who have the full operation details. There are many scattered across the Sirius who may know tiny bits of irrevalent details but we are the only ones, and since we are here alone no-one else in the Sirius could know.&quot; The officers then grinned again and eachover and burst out laughing. This time not even the technician got it. One of the officers then turned. The technician hurridly translated. &quot;Rest assured comrade, whatever happens it will mean the destruction of the Sirius sector!!!!!&quot; They all left laughing. The technician paused by the door. &quot;Get some rest, your new job starts tomorrow and if the ferocity of the fighting is anything to go by, you've got a hell of a day coming up. He left, leaving Waalbeck very confused but more weary</div>

<br />&quot;Omicron Black 9 this is patrol Alpha Zeta 1 i have detected a jump signature&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;On my way&quot; i responded.
<br />
<br />It had taken me awhile to get a good trajectory to head back to SOL but once there i was told a large Coalition force had jumped on a heading for sirius.I came u pon the coordinates of the jump drive signature and saw a strange fighter in fron of me it was no of any design Coalition,Alliance or sirius but i hailed it anyway.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Omicron Black 9 you are entering restricted space identify yourseldf or you will be destroyed&quot; i waited for an answer the pilot was either stupid,dead or unconsous.
<br /> so i took him into tow and headed for the high security Jupiter research lab...

			<div class="content">Araminta appeared in a flash of flame on Viator's ship. Since Arania's Sacrifice to the cosmic plane she was able to travel much further from him than normal, but it still had limits.
<br />Wincing at the faint throbbing paing in her heart, she flapped over to the door of the cockpit where Viator and his D&#230;mon lay.
<br />She let out a high-frequency whistle. Viator didnt hear it, but his d&#230;mon did, and she lifted her head, wondering where the noise came from.
<br />Araminta let out another whistle, calling the dragon-d&#230;mon to her.
<br />The d&#230;mon called alexander trotted out the door, coming face-to-face with Araminta
<br />&quot;Who are you?&quot; Viator's d&#230;mon asked
<br />&quot;Im Araminta, Arania's d&#230;mon&quot; Araminta replied &quot;You?&quot;
<br />&quot;I am called Alexander&quot;
<br />Araminta cocked her head, thinking
<br />&quot;Obviously you have not discovered that you are female yet...&quot; Ara replied &quot;And Alexander is CEARTAINLY an odd name for a female&quot;
<br />&quot;How do you know i am female?&quot;
<br />&quot;Your Human is male, therefore, YOU are Female&quot; Ara replied &quot;I cant really blame Viator for his mistake, OR you... Arania asked me to come and tell you that, pass the massage onto Viator will you?&quot;
<br />With that, Araminta vanished, rushing back across the cosmos to quell the burning sorrow in her heart from being away from him so long and so far</div>

			<div class="content">I woke up inside my ship's cockpit. Which for some reason was inside a station. It would have made me look around if I didn't have a hangover. I wondered if cybernetic beings could have hangovers, but that just made it worse. Alexander flew down gracefully from behind the seat.
<br />
<br />&quot;We have to talk.&quot;
<br />
<br />I had noticed its voice had changed. It had become more feminine.
<br />
<br />&quot;Unless you can cure hangovers, go away.&quot;
<br />&quot;I can't, but you can. You have got internal repair systems.&quot;
<br />
<br />I thought about it and in doing so something was being released into my bloodstream which removed the pain.
<br />
<br />&quot;That worked... thanks Alexander.&quot;
<br />
<br />Alexander looked at me funny.
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to talk. Its about the fact that I am not male.&quot;
<br />&quot;Really? Your voice was deeper before...&quot;
<br />&quot;Exactly, it was still maturing into its current form.&quot;
<br />&quot;So you want a more feminine name, right?&quot;
<br />
<br />It obviously had some of my personality, as it just stared blankly at me.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'll take that as a yes. Hmm... let me think...&quot;
<br />&quot;How about...&quot;
<br />&quot;I got it! Instead of Alexander, I shall call you...&quot;
<br />&quot;Wait for it...&quot;
<br />&quot;Indigo.&quot;
<br />
<br />It stared at me again.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm named after a color?&quot;
<br />&quot;Hey, you said it was my choice.&quot;
<br />
<br />I must have misinterperted something
<br />
<br />&quot;I am not saying that it's a bad name, I am just saying it's... different.&quot;
<br />&quot;Then it's settled. Different is my style.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now was the time to explore my surroundings. I was in a station of some form, but the writing on the walls was in some strange language that I could not comprehend.
<br />
<br />So this was Sol. It didn't seem much of a glimmering Utopia. It just looked like Caimbridge.

			<div class="content">So far, it was not going well. Most of the remaining inhabitants of the Northern Sirius seemed unwilling to leave, even under the imminent threat of death.
<br />&quot;You know what happened to Tau-37? That will happen to you, you stubborn fools!&quot; yelled Waalbeck hoarsly. Well at least he was assured a trip back to the new Coalition worlds. He was even learning some of their language and writings. The Coalition had been doing some exploring for the past 800 years while the Alliance had been colonising the Sirius. They had also mastered a warping technology, allowing them to travel great distances almost instantly, similar to the Jump-gate thing but a whole lot better, and bug-free.
<br />
<br />As the inhabitants of Planet Harris left, back towards their mindless dull jobs while grumbling about their insignificant lives Waalbeck stepped off the stage. Oh well, that's Harris down the spout. He approached Vasily, the technician who spoke english and was his personal assistant and liason to the Coalition. &quot;So friend, which grovelling, pirate infested hole do we travel to next?&quot; Vasily looked uneasy. &quot;Change of plans comrade, we leave for the Battleship Trotsky in 20 minutes...say your goodbyes to the Sirius.&quot; And with that he paused. It looked as though he was going to say something else but he just shook his head and walked off.
<br />
<br />Waalbeck tried not to reflect. It just hurt to much to think of all the twists and turns and plots from serving for the Rheinland military's conquest of the Sirius, to now. If someone had've said back then, that he would end up working for the Coalition and be one of the only people to leave the Sirius he would've called the MPs for disorderly behaviour under the influence of alcohol. Then he heard the heavily accented voice calling out to him. Waalbeck sighed. So this was it. He collected a little bit of the Harris topsoil and canned it. An ancient practise often undertaken by travellers to rare and strange lands. Then he walked to the massive Mirov class transport that was hovering over the landing pad facilities at Planet Harris. That was one thing you had to get used to, the Coalition ships were huge! He walked on board and took a seat with the few Harris locals who had belived him. He looked out of a side-porthole and took his last views of the Sirius as they flew up through the atmosphere and into space. The Coalition ships did not need a docking ring, so therefore could go and come as they please throughout the planet's atmosphere.
<br />
<br />A couple of hours later, on the viewing deck of the Trotsky, Waalbeck took his last views of Sirius space. Pre-warp checks had been done but the Trotsky was to remain until at least 70% of the Sirius had been crippled by the Coalition's plans. This would start with the detonation of the Kusari systems, which were virtually barren and lifeless due to the previous brutal Rheinland assaults.
<br />
<br />Waalbeck watched the small screen intently. A small droid bot was providing a live-feed from the Honshu system. Suddenly there was a catastrophic explosion around the sun's corona. Then the sun collapsed sending out massive beams of energy either side, vaporising anything that got in it's way and a deadly shockwave that burnt all the atmosphere of planets. He watched with horror as Planet Honshu's atmosphere ran off it and the planet turned dark while veins of lava popped out and then the droid cut out. &quot;How..how..how do you do that?&quot; asked Waalbeck with morbid fascination. A passing Coalition commander stopped and said something. Vasily translated. &quot;Well comrade, that is for us to know, and you to find out when you get to our worker's paradise.&quot; As the droid bots in all the systems of the Sirius began shutting off as the exploding suns destroyed them and danger alarms sounded for sun integrity in various systems an alarm klaxon sounded and a digital voice sounded through out the ship.
<br />WARP IN
<br />3.....
<br />2.....
<br />1.....
<br />The ship visually bucked and twisted and gradually faded away as the other Coalition ships did, in the various parts of the rapidly destabilising Sirius. A couple didn't make it, but in the space of five minutes, the Coalition prescence in the Sirius went from four fleets to nothing. (minus two foolhardy Coalition commanders)
<br />
<br />Why does the guerrilla fighter fight? We must come to the inevitable conclusion that the guerrilla fighter is a social reformer, that he takes up arms responding to the angry protest of the people against their oppressors, and that he fights in order to change the social system that keeps all his unarmed brothers in ignominy and misery. -  Ernesto Che Guevara</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;The Dom'Kavash were right&quot; Arania said, looking upon the sheer devastation brought upon the Sirius Sector &quot;We are unfit to inhabit Sirius&quot;
<br />&quot;Why do we fight Ara? What desire makes us want to destroy everything around us?&quot;
<br />&quot;We cant see anything without wanting to destroy it, thats human nature&quot; Araminta replied.
<br />&quot;Cant we all just get along?&quot; Arania said
<br />He materialised on Earth, staring around at the complete and utter devastation brought by 'human nature'
<br />Nothing but wastelands abounded, as far as the eyes could see, no water, nothing apart from faceless brown dust.
<br />Arania raised his arms toward the sky, and immediatley, green sprouts erupted from the ground, slowly growing as he rose his arms higher and higher.
<br />The land swelled and water burst forth, creating oceans.
<br />Soon, the entire planet was a paridise, plant life, water, animals, fish, birds, everywhere.
<br />Arania was standing in a large clearing, the only remnant of the devastation that had been transfored into a paradise.
<br />Life did not grow here, and upon that ground he placed a beacon, a monolith of sorts, and upon that beacon, he wrote, in the language of the stars:
<br />'Upon this ground I have reversed the sands of time, and given life to that which was dead. May the lifeless clearing that this beacon stands on represent the fragility of what you have been given.'
<br />The beacon shone, the light stretching far into the sky across Sol.
<br />Standing back, he walked towards the home he had given himself, a rock cave not far from the beacon, filled with light-giving crystals.
<br />A small bird flew into the cave, settling onto Arania's other shoulder.
<br />Admiring the Avian, ha made the last move to the new world, he gave the species of that bird self-awareness.
<br />Although it would be millenia before the bird civilisation on this world attained the ability to travel among the stars, Arania hoped that the sanctity of this world would serve as a message to he other civilisations in this galaxy.
<br />&quot;Come to me&quot; He called to the minds of what humans were left in Sol, including Viator and DragonBorn &quot;Come to Earth, see the glory of life, help me fight the Coalition, make Humankind see past thier petty nature and oive in harmony&quot;
<br />&quot;Come to me&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">OOC: l33t! i get 100th post! w00t! (exscuse my l33t.)
<br />
<br />IC:
<br />For some reason, sitting in that cargo hold, I hated being there. Hated being imprisoned against my will. I would not be kept like an animal. Even when I lived on Citadel, (how I miss those times) I had an urge to seek out something... different. Indigo seemed to have the same urge. She was tapping on the back of my head, trying to awaken me from my slumber. I managed to mutter a groggy response. Indigo just looked at me funny.
<br />
<br />&quot;There is something going on outside. We must investigate.&quot;
<br />&quot;Have a look around. WE'RE STUCK IN A F***ING STATION!!! If you have a way out, please, do share.&quot;
<br />
<br />Indigo transported outside of the ship. She began collecting electrical energy from all sources in the station, and energy from the lights.
<br />
<br />(OOC: the only way I can describe this is like Bahamut from FFVIII.)
<br />
<br />A ball of energy, a combination of light, heat, sound and electrical energy rotated in fromt of her. Within a flash, she propelled the ball straight into the exit door. Wind howled and gushed out of the station and Indigo transported back into my ship. She looked at me with anticipation. I nodded and engaged the engines. We blasted out of the docking bay, leaving a massive decompression event in docking bay 1, and a large hole in the side of the station.
<br />
<br />At first I didn't notice what Indigo was so eager to show me, since earth was a desolate wasteland. But that had changed somehow. A massive electromagnetic beacon was pulsating on the surface. The last time I transported, I ended up with a hangover, but without a docking ring, this baby would burn up in the atmosphere. I had no chioce but to transport the ship, Indigo and myself down to the surface.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is going to hurt...&quot; I muttered under my breath.
<br />
<br />I transformed all the systems on the ship, all of Indigo's compisition, and my own body into magnetic energy, and directed it all at the beacon. I reassembled the parts just before entagling with the beacon's magnetic field. First the ship, then Indigo, and finally myself.
<br />
<br />&quot;I...&quot;
<br />
<br />I passed out before I could say anything else.
<br />
<br />I awoke next to my ship in the middle of a clearing, which looked like Earth when I first saw it. Desolate, lifeless, except for one single monolith, which was producing the beacon's signal. I walked over to it and noticed an inscription. It was in the language of the ancients, and I only knew very little. That was Aleksei's field of expertise. There was an abundance of plant life and and animal life in the forests surrounding the clearing, but there something else. Some other force was controlling this. I moved into a state of pure light and scanned the clearing, noticing a cave in the nearby cliffs. Changing back into my original form, I began to explore the cave, with Indigo following close behind. There was a great suprise waiting for me in there and I was about to find out what it was.

			<div class="content">&quot;alert a prisoner has escaped from the cargo bay in his ship all units interct him immdedialtly!&quot; the voice over the public channel said.
<br /> I immediately set out in pursuit of the escaped prisoner but suddenly it was almost like someone was inside my mind and it kept saying.
<br />&quot;go to earth and meet the prophet of the stars&quot;
<br />so i turned around and headed for earth...
<br />
<br />     ***30 minutes later***
<br />
<br />i saw the beacon from space and since my fighter was equipped with atmospheric sheilding i land at the beacon and noticed the prisoner ship and his foot prints leading off into the under brush.
<br /><i>even better </i>  i thought <i>now i can recapture the prisoner and find out what is in my mind. </i>

			<div class="content">He was little known, he worked in Ageria. He was a skilled Trade Lane technician. 
<br />
<br />
<br />but he got laid off.
<br />
<br />now he goes by 666Heretic, he is kind of like the ancient earth anime character vash the stampede, he is credited with things he hasnt done. 
<br />
<br />He has bountys on his head for hacking and crashing trade lane systems, yet he always manages to give them the slip. Normally you can find him eating a box of donuts, pigging out on food, or getting drunk at the bar.
<br />
<br />Anyway here's the rest of his story
<br />
<br />After he got laid off he decided to freelance, little did he know he was about to embark on a journy. Now along with the Order, he fights the new nomad incursion........meanwhile getting shot at by bountys. This kid doesnt know when to stop, he's got a hot temper too. Cross paths with him and you might be either baffled, dumbfounded, laughing, crying, or......drunk.
<br />
<br />He used to pirate a little, he used to just hide in clouds. Disrupt a trade lane, and steal things like diapers and food. He was the worst pirate anyone has ever heard of.
<br />
<br />
<br />yet he was never caught.
<br />
<br />like i said, he's just a good for nothing person. He fights nomads, and gets attacked by bounty hunters....
<br />
<br />
<br />what more could you want from a guy
<br />
<br />
<br />(ok so i didnt really make a good one, but i can make some good ones)

			<div class="content">Arania slept, if that what it could be called. Being an Ancient didnt really allow him to sleep, he didnt need it. Thus, the function of 'sleep' had been removed from his biomechanical functions.
<br />Araminta sat on the floor, caramalising some sugar on her left wing..
<br />Arania's concioousness shifted from the past back to the present.
<br />Vitor stood at the mouth of the cave, his d&#230;mon standing next to him.
<br />A single red dot appeared on Viator's head, he didnt notice it himself, but Arania certainly did.
<br />Dashing out of the corner of the cave, he ran to the cave mouth, knocking Viator out of the way just as a single laser shot came from below.
<br />Arania raised his hand, his palm open and pointing directly at Dragonborn.
<br />Dragonborn screamed as a white light slowly detached from him.
<br />Floating around his head, the light slowly settled and took form.
<br />Dragonborn quietened as his d&#230;mon settled on the ground.
<br />
<br />OOC: DB- your d&#230;mon's form is a representation of your personality, like who you really are inside, thier personality is similar to yours but carries your deeper desires. Males d&#230;mons are female, female's d&#230;mons are male. names are usually decided by the human and fit with the d&#230;mons form and personality</div>
