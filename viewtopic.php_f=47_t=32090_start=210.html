			<div class="content">*Beeeeeep*
<br />WEVE GOT V-FIB, CLEAR!
<br />*Zap!*
<br />Nothing, CLEAR!*
<br />*Zap!!*
<br />Ive got a pulse!
<br />------
<br />
<br />Thousands of years, and I have seen all that I would ever have wished to have seen. The Insufference of life, hypocrisy, betrayal, hatred, the pit of human life. But not only human life, Sentience, it was a fatal flaw, the Creators got it wrong. 
<br />What I have seen could tear apart the mind of one weaker. It has already sent me teeming to the edge of insanity, only to fight back against it, endlessly.
<br />Why do I keep fighting it? Humanity needs me, humanity needs us, Life, needs us. Maybe if I was a normal person, I&#8217;d have the time and justification for a nice, comfortable nervous breakdown, but Fate doesn&#8217;t work that way. Fate chooses the most least likely people, chucks them into the least likely situations, with the least likelihood of coming out alive.
<br />But,
<br />If this is my path
<br />Who am I to change it now?
<br />We&#8217;ve got a universe to save.
<br />
<br />
<br />I sat back as the Z-Axis fighter set down, trying to block out the endless white noise that continued to encompass my mind, almost coming to the point of unbearability.
<br /><i>&#8220;You little&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Come here you little s..&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Please&#8230; Help me&#8230;&#8221; </i>
<br />Images, swirling, endlessly. I resisted the urge to scream, and staggered upright, barely even managing that easy task.
<br />&#8220;You look like s..t mate&#8221; Viator said, entering the ship.
<br />That about summed it up for me, I felt like it.
<br />&#8220;I feel like it buddy&#8221; I said, resisting the urge to faint &#8220;You want to take us out? I&#8217;m not feeling too good&#8221;
<br />&#8220;With pleasure&#8221; He replied
<br /><i>&#8220;Eat me&#8230;&#8221; </i>
<br />I shook my head, trying to clear the images
<br />&#8220;Ara?&#8221; I said, weakly
<br />&#8220;I see it too&#8221; She said &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;I have no idea&#8221; I whispered, sitting down at the back while the ship lifted off &#8220;I was hoping you could tell me&#8221;
<br />She shook her head
<br />&#8220;Not a clue&#8221; She replied
<br /><i>&#8220;&#8230; like it like that, don&#8217;t you&#8230;&#8221; </i>
<br />I grunted, focussing on the front of the ship.
<br />&#8220;Adam is dead, by the way&#8221; Indigo said
<br />&#8220;I know&#8221; I replied, watching the atmosphere fade away
<br /><i>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t please, don&#8217;t, STOP!&#8221; </i>
<br />&#8220;We know all to well&#8221; Ara said
<br />My eyes blurred slightly, and my balance shifted slightly
<br />&#8220;You all right back there?&#8221; Viator asked, the concern in his voice hidden, but not completely
<br />&#8220;Actually&#8230;&#8221; I began
<br /><i>&#8220;This is the best you can do?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Please, Master&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Get back here! SLAVE!&#8221; </i>
<br />I had a sudden vision. It was in a small room, a small girl was tied up spread-eagle in the centre, with an old man towering over her with a whip. I barely had time to register anything before the crack of the whip sounded on the girl&#8217;s back, and with that, the vision vanished.
<br />&#8220;&#8230; No&#8221; I finished, swaying
<br />He turned, and looked at me. He told me later that I looked like a ghost, I was so white.
<br />&#8220;Arania?&#8221; He asked, concerned
<br /><i>&#8220;Give in, you know you want to&#8221; </i>
<br />&#8220;Eh?&#8221; I said, looking up, trying to register him in the blur
<br />My stomach lurched, and it was barely ten seconds before I was in the rear of the ship, vomiting up bile.
<br />&#8220;Ugh&#8221; I said, flushing the mess down, before, sliding down the bathroom wall to join Ara on the floor
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s happening to me?&#8221; I said, the visions subsiding, for now
<br />&#8220;Us&#8221; Araminta corrected &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Its like, every memory any human has ever had&#8221; I said, trying to comprehend it.
<br />&#8220;Adam&#8217;s memories&#8221; Ara suggested
<br />I looked down at her, my vision clearing.
<br />&#8220;They ARE Adam&#8217;s memories&#8221; Ara said, louder
<br />I scooped her up, and rushed out of the bathroom, almost colliding with Viator on the way.
<br />&#8220;How long ago did you kill Adam?&#8221; I asked
<br />&#8220;Barely a few hours&#8221; Viator replied
<br />&#8220;Oh god&#8230;&#8221; I said, going pale again, and backing into the wall.
<br />&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Viator asked me
<br />I was about to respond, before the ship lurched suddenly sideways before coming to a halt.
<br />&#8220;What was that?&#8221; Viator and Araminta said in unison
<br />&#8220;No idea&#8221; Indigo and I said
<br />We all looked at each other, and the weird thing we just did.
<br />We walked back into the cockpit, to find ourselves in the hangar of a massive ship.
<br />&#8220;That looks Aztec in design&#8221; I said, noticing the odd pyramidical design
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s Quetzalcoatl&#8217;s Ship&#8221; Viator said
<br />&#8220;And we didn&#8217;t see it&#8221; Indigo said
<br />&#8220;So either we really do have the biggest lucky streak of all time&#8221; I said
<br />&#8220;Or we&#8217;re expected&#8221; Ara finished
<br />&#8220;Neither of which particularly appeals to me&#8221; Viator said, peering out of the cockpit dome.
<br />&#8220;But we do have to find Erin&#8221; Indigo stated
<br />I glanced over to her unconscious D&#230;mon
<br />&#8220;Let&#8217;s go&#8221; I said, walking out of the ship.
<br />I stepped on the odd stone-like floor of the bay, the material crunching beneath my feet.
<br />&#8220;So, where to first?&#8221; Viator asked, stepping from the ship, Indigo cradling Erin&#8217;s d&#230;mon.
<br />My vision blurred, and I took all of my strength to keep breathing. I fell to my knees, clutching my head, and screamed.
<br />&#8220;Arania?&#8221; Viator shouted
<br />I lowered my arms, and felt a single tear fall from my cheek onto the floor below.
<br />&#8220;Ill be fine&#8221; I said, rising back up &#8220;We have a friend to save&#8221;
<br />I pulled the hood on my cloak up, and briefly saw my hand glow very pale yellow before I drew it away again.
<br />I put it back up, and deduced that the scar on my face was glowing, but quickly losing its luminosity
<br />&#8220;Come on&#8221; Araminta said in my ear, soothingly &#8220;We&#8217;ll be alright&#8221;
<br />I turned
<br />&#8220;Viator&#8221; I said, pulling my hand in a sweeping motion. &#8220;Lead the way&#8221;
<br />
<br />------
<br />Ok, 25ccs of adrenalin, let me know if its condition deteriorates any further.

			<div class="content">you son't ave to be so dramatic Arania, it ain't dead, as long as i'm not in school atleast <img src=smilies/icon_smile_blush.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />    The fighters of the RR or raiden resistance docked in the fighter bay i had cleaned out during my boarding of the ship and headed toward the entertainment section, it appears that this was not just a warship that was massive enough it could hold up to 600 fighters, 150 in each of the four fighter bays, it had a onboard factory living areas greenhouses, it was a literal city in space. It could also be a very powerful ship, I was currently in the captains room in a sort of trance combining aranias' powers i had gained and combining them with my own integrated nano technology, using the unlimted energy of being part ancient(hope that's what its called since ican't remember) and creating billions of nanites to repair the ship and update its systems, i started first with making a more advanced artificial intelligence to mamage all the new systems that were being installed. After that i worked on the fighter and gunship production  facilities just below and behind the fighter bays the als ohad gunship launching capability.
<br />
<br />
<br />   Then it was time to build the Jumpdrive, Shield generators, armor and weaponry, i started first with the shield generators, my nanobots built 6 super capital class shield generators one above and below each foighter bay and then the  other two in the stern. Next was the layered armor. Ablative matrices of solid hydrogen(very hard substance created under extreme pressure such as a gas giant core) interlaced with adamantium made it all but indestructible unless from a concentrated assault. All this work took about a month to complete as the ship was so big the replication of the armor took about 3 weeks. Next the weapons would take the longest of all. I had my nanites replicate every type of weapon imaginable. Beam cannons,massive Rail gun turrets that could go through 3 confederate dreadnoughts and then there was my personal favorite, the darkamtter arrays, they are basically space version of sonic cannons atcing as a repuslor wave to damage any unshielded object and push it back at the same time.This took another 2 months as they were much more complex than the armor and i also had the top and bottom of both of the wings to cover not just the body, any fighters hoping to cripple the ship by punching through the armor on the wings with a concentrated burst of firepower would get a big surprise. 
<br />
<br />   I have now been working on the jumdrive for almost 2 weeks, it is about 6 decks high and very complex, i couldn't let the nanobots do it on their own i had to take control of them. I also had to create a power source for all  these weapons shield generators and jumpdrive. I built 5 matter/anti-matter reactors to aid the main quantum reactor that was already in the ship, atleast these invaders knew how to amke a decent reactor. As i come out of a state of depp concentration i see a man from the resistance infront of me waiting anxiously.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir&quot; he said helping me from my cross legged position to standing.
<br />
<br />&quot;The invaders have attacked Raiden prime&quot; At this news i became fully alert and headed for the nearest lift to the bridge.
<br />
<br />As soon as the doors opened i started barking orders &quot;helm set course for raiden Prime and engage jumpdrive on my mark&quot; i pressed the shipwide intercom buttton.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Dragonborn speaking, all personel man your battlestations and prepare for encounter on jump end&quot; I switched the intercom off &quot;helmsman, engage jumpdrive, destination high Raiden Prime orbit&quot;
<br />
<br />The behemoth of a ship glowed for a second before accelerating into jumpspace.(it's too massive for the jump to be instantaneous <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />
<br />
<br />There you satisfied i added another section <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">OOC: I'm still writing. I should be finishing this up soon, the storyline involving the Confederates might have to wait til another story. Anyway, on with the show.
<br />

<br />
<br /><i>Just the thought of those eyes, watching somebody else, burns me, those arms holding somebody else, burns me, and those hands, touching somebody else, kills me. oh Fate, put out the light, just put out the light. </i>
<br />
<br />I stepped out of the small fighter and looked around at the eloborate chamber where we were held. I scanned the walls, looking for an exit, looking for some guide to where Erin might be held captive. The room was almost hermitically sealed, no obvious way in or out, not obvious doors, vents or service ducts. It was almost as if the ship was so well designed that it didn't require maintenance. Ornate decorations lined all the walls, all covered in what appeared to be gold. I turned back to the ship to see Arania stumble out of the hold of he fighter, the images and thoughts of the departed Adam flooding his conciousness. As soon as his feet touched the polished black floors, he stumbled forward, falling to his knees and vomiting up more bile.
<br />
<br />&quot;Jeez, you alright?&quot; I asked him, no longer trying to hide the concern in my voice.
<br />&quot;I'll live... Side effects from the death of evil.&quot;
<br />&quot;Well, hurry up. I'm starting to get nervous.&quot;
<br />
<br />Indigo flew over my head, searching the room for an exit. It might be a while until we figure this one out.
<br />
<br />-:-
<br />
<br /><i>So many years I stood among the thoughts and tears of those I served.
<br />Among my own I was alone through my own doing.
<br />All the years I walked unknown behind the faces I assumed.
<br />Powerless to clear your mind of what you'd suffered.
<br />
<br />I'd only come here seeking peace.
<br />I'd only come here seeking me.
<br />It seems I came to leave. </i>
<br />
<br />At the bottom of a dark pit, covered in hand crafted symbols, a decrepit being lay on the cold floor. A dark tangle of hair covering it's head, whilst only rags covered the rest of it's body. The smell of human waste had become a familiar smell in the dank pit, which, at the bottom measured only 4 metres square, with what looked like a doorway in one wall.
<br />
<br />Air moved slowly down in this cruel prison, the only ventilation coming from the lungs of the being trapped at the bottom of this hellhole. Nothing stirred, nothing moved, except for the minute up and down motion of the human's chest, allowing air to move.
<br />
<br />Light flooded into the chamber, waking the human, now revealing itself to be female, her quiet blue eyes set like sapphires in her pale face. He tiny frame had become more noticeable, her skin hanging from her bones, no muscle tone remaining. She grabbed at her chest, the throbbing pain that she felt every day had somehow subsided, weaker than before. The doorway in the wall had opened up, filling the pit with light, only a black shadow appearing in the light. Time seemed to slow in here, where a day would feel like only a minute had passed outside. There was no way of proving it, no way of knowing, no information leaked into this horrific cell.
<br />
<br />This shadow had become a regular visitor, either to deliver her the tiny amount of food needed to sustain her being, or deliver the enormity of pain, an endless torture, with only one purpose in mind: to break her physical body in as many ways as possible. But this time she thought something was different. Something was here, that shouldn't be, and that she would die before she would find out.

<br /><i>
<br />We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment,
<br />We are choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside
<br />This holy reality, this holy experience.
<br />Choosing to be here in,
<br />
<br />This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
<br />This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
<br />All this pain is an illusion. </i>
<br />
<br />The searing hot iron forced deep into her flesh, instantly burning away the skin surrounding the area. A cry of pain echoed throughout the bowels of the ship, the sound travelling through the cracks and crevices, the small amount that there was, a spiritual energy travelling with it, unseen and unheard. Again, as soon as she had made a sound, the sadistic brutes surrounding her beat her until she made no sound, and then placed her back into her horrific cell. Her tears stained the rencid stone floor, as her body began to heal the injuries sustained through today's torture. It was pain, then recovery, an then pain all over again. The fairytales were wrong. There was no white knight in her mind. Only dark shadows of what used to be good and pure.
<br />
<br />-:-
<br /><i>
<br />Beauty is what the eyes behold.
<br />And you burn brighter than most.
<br />I chased you thru the midnight streets,
<br />To be where I could speak freely.
<br />
<br />I didn&#8217;t care what tomorrow held,
<br />I felt the world turning only for us.
<br />Only bliss now for you and me,
<br />Rise up let life&#8217;s kiss send us reeling.
<br />
<br />And unlike the times before,
<br />From yesterday comes tomorrow.
<br />
<br />When life comes alive the past moves aside </i>
<br />
<br />Indigo had been circling for a good five minutes when she felt something. We all felt something. There was no sound, but there was something, something that was eminating a feeling. Pain. Arania and I looked at each other and began to frantically search for a way out of the room. The feeling was almost overpowering, to know that something was suffering so much, was in so much agony.
<br />
<br />I ran up to the far wall and began to pound on the ornate decorations, my strength denting the fragile decorations, the gold falling to the floor, the sound echoing thorughout the hangar. The wall seemed to be hollow, almost like a door, but just covered to make it blend in. I focused all the energy i had and forced my fist into the weak wall. There was a loud crash, as the massive metal structure gave way, leaving a gaping hole in the wall. I turned around to Arania.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wait until those visions get less frequent, then find Quetzacoatl. Don't risk it until then.&quot;
<br />
<br />And with that I walked through the new hole with Indigo swooping through after me.
<br />
<br /><i> When I first came to this island
<br />that I called by own name
<br />I was happy in this fortress,
<br />in my exile I remained
<br />But the hours grew so empty
<br />and the ocean sent her waves
<br />In the figure of a woman
<br />and she pulled me out to sea
<br />
<br />When you come down to take me home
<br />send my soul away
<br />When you come round you&#8217;ll make me whole
<br />send my soul away </i>

			<div class="content">As I watched viator rush down the corridor, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a strange presence, from all around, as though the ship was alive.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is this place?&#8221; I muttered to myself, still trying to shut out the visions that plagued my consciousness
<br />Voices, swirling&#8230; no, not swirling, there were voices&#8230;
<br /><i>Servo, vestry&#8230; </i>
<br />&#8220;What?&#8221; Araminta said, listening to the voices, as I was
<br /><i>Servo vestri ex oblivio&#8230; </i>
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s latin&#8221; I said to myself &#8220;Servo, save&#8230; vestra&#8230; Yourself, you&#8230; ex oblivio&#8230;&#8221;
<br />I thought, trying to block out the visions
<br />&#8220;ex&#8230; from&#8230;&#8221; I placed a hand on the side of the ship, steading myself &#8220;oblivio&#8230; oblivion&#8230;&#8221;
<br />I paled, realising&#8230;
<br /><i>Servo vestri ex oblivio&#8230; </i>
<br />&#8220;Save yourself&#8230; from oblivion&#8221; Ara and I said in unison
<br />I laid myself back, recoiling at the voice
<br />&#8220;What is this ship?&#8221; I said &#8220;What has been done to this ship?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s a ship?&#8221; Ara quipped
<br />I turned, fear rising in my heart. Viator, Erin&#8230; The ship was alive, if it could be called that. I may have been overcome by Adams memories and curses, but I should have been able to handle them on my own, if not for this ship. This ship, if not indeed the creator that was on board&#8230;
<br />I rushed into the ship, ready to tear it apart, searching&#8230;
<br />&#8220;I know you left it behind, Viator, where is it?&#8221;
<br />Araminta fluttered to the helm seat, unable to cling to my thrashing body as I searched.
<br />&#8220;Where is it&#8230;?&#8221; I kept muttering, tearing off access panels, before finally searching in the logical place&#8230;
<br />Under the seat
<br />I must admit, the dark blade was surprisingly light, looked closer, gazing at an inscription on the hilt:
<br />&#8216;Nex poena&#8217;
<br />Death Penalty
<br />What was with this world and it&#8217;s obsession with Latin?
<br />I took the blade, and walked out of the ship, Ara flying over and once again perching on my shoulder.
<br />The ship was alive, I have no doubt of that. How or why didn&#8217;t matter any more. But I intended to make sure this monstrosity went back to where it came from.
<br />The corridor that viator had discovered was bleak, dark. But I knew better. It was almost paranoia, as though I could feel the ship breathing&#8230;
<br />I continued on, attempting to feel my way forward, finding the ships bridge though the extrasensory blackout of the ship. Finally coming to a bulkhead
<br />The design was, alien, demonic, even considering everything that I had seen.
<br />The door opened, as though sensing my presence, revealing a massive bridge, overshadowed my massive monoliths hanging from the ceiling.
<br />I entered the room, approaching the nearest computer, of what I thought was a computer.
<br />&gt;:
<br />&#8220;That prompt looks familiar&#8230;&#8221; I muttered
<br />&gt;: Systems diagnostic
<br />&gt;Initialising Diagnostic programme

<br />&gt;Secondary and Support Generators-Online

<br />I smiled, I knew exactly where it was heading. In twenty minutes this ship was going back where it came from.
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t let you do that&#8221; Came a voice, from behind me
<br />&#8220;Hello Q&#8221; I said, turning
<br />I was expecting the old Aztec god to be a towering behemoth. I did NOT, however, expect him to be human, and I even expected less, for him to like identical to me.
<br />&#8220;Long time no see, Arania&#8221; Q replied, grinning like a madman
<br />I raised the Dark sword, pointing it at him in accusation.
<br />&#8220;Evil&#8221; I muttered under my breath, pointing the sword at his head
<br />&#8220;Now now&#8221; He said, his voice reverberating demonically &#8220;No need to insult your host, Ancient&#8221;
<br />&#8221;Hah&#8221; I muttered &#8220;I am my own host? What a screwey world this has become. Although you don&#8217;t have a form do you, you parasitic creator? You have to steal them form people&#8217;s minds. Or lacking that, their BODIES!&#8221;
<br />Q&#8217;s smile faltered
<br />&#8220;That was uncalled for&#8221; He said
<br />&#8220;Get out of my way, or you will find what else is &#8216;uncalled for&#8217;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;This ship won&#8217;t let me die&#8221;
<br />&#8220;In twenty minutes, this ship is going back to the dark pit that spawned it&#8221;
<br />The klaxons wailed again
<br />&#8220;Warning, nineteen minutes to Gravity Drive activation&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Correction:&#8221; I said &#8220;Nineteen minutes&#8221;
<br />I swung the sword, only to find that it passed though him.
<br />Q vanished, his laughter echoing around the ship
<br />&#8220;Q is the ship?&#8221; Ara muttered
<br />I spun, again typing on the console
<br />&gt;: Lockout Gravity Drive systems
<br />&gt;Lockout Confirmed
<br />I turned and ran, hoping upon hopes that Viator would find Erin and make it back to the ship before the drive activated, for what lay beyond that jump&#8230; even I fear to imagine.</div>

			<div class="content">As I watched viator rush down the corridor, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a strange presence, from all around, as though the ship was alive.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is this place?&#8221; I muttered to myself, still trying to shut out the visions that plagued my consciousness
<br />Voices, swirling&#8230; no, not swirling, there were voices&#8230;
<br /><i>Servo, vestry&#8230; </i>
<br />&#8220;What?&#8221; Araminta said, listening to the voices, as I was
<br /><i>Servo vestri ex oblivio&#8230; </i>
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s latin&#8221; I said to myself &#8220;Servo, save&#8230; vestra&#8230; Yourself, you&#8230; ex oblivio&#8230;&#8221;
<br />I thought, trying to block out the visions
<br />&#8220;ex&#8230; from&#8230;&#8221; I placed a hand on the side of the ship, steading myself &#8220;oblivio&#8230; oblivion&#8230;&#8221;
<br />I paled, realising&#8230;
<br /><i>Servo vestri ex oblivio&#8230; </i>
<br />&#8220;Save yourself&#8230; from oblivion&#8221; Ara and I said in unison
<br />I laid myself back, recoiling at the voice
<br />&#8220;What is this ship?&#8221; I said &#8220;What has been done to this ship?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s a ship?&#8221; Ara quipped
<br />I turned, fear rising in my heart. Viator, Erin&#8230; The ship was alive, if it could be called that. I may have been overcome by Adams memories and curses, but I should have been able to handle them on my own, if not for this ship. This ship, if not indeed the creator that was on board&#8230;
<br />I rushed into the ship, ready to tear it apart, searching&#8230;
<br />&#8220;I know you left it behind, Viator, where is it?&#8221;
<br />Araminta fluttered to the helm seat, unable to cling to my thrashing body as I searched.
<br />&#8220;Where is it&#8230;?&#8221; I kept muttering, tearing off access panels, before finally searching in the logical place&#8230;
<br />Under the seat
<br />I must admit, the dark blade was surprisingly light, looked closer, gazing at an inscription on the hilt:
<br />&#8216;Nex poena&#8217;
<br />Death Penalty
<br />What was with this world and it&#8217;s obsession with Latin?
<br />I took the blade, and walked out of the ship, Ara flying over and once again perching on my shoulder.
<br />The ship was alive, I have no doubt of that. How or why didn&#8217;t matter any more. But I intended to make sure this monstrosity went back to where it came from.
<br />The corridor that viator had discovered was bleak, dark. But I knew better. It was almost paranoia, as though I could feel the ship breathing&#8230;
<br />I continued on, attempting to feel my way forward, finding the ships bridge though the extrasensory blackout of the ship. Finally coming to a bulkhead
<br />The design was, alien, demonic, even considering everything that I had seen.
<br />The door opened, as though sensing my presence, revealing a massive bridge, overshadowed my massive monoliths hanging from the ceiling.
<br />I entered the room, approaching the nearest computer, of what I thought was a computer.
<br />&gt;:
<br />&#8220;That prompt looks familiar&#8230;&#8221; I muttered

<br />The squallid hell hole at the base of that dank pit had the same smell as it always did, the same rancid smell of human waste, the same cold floor, which her body would smack against every day, bruising her in one more place, she had lost count after two weeks of where all the injuries were, where the damage was done. But every day she would wake up alive, alive and ready for another day of pain, of suffering at the hands of a brutal captor. But as she woke up today, she felt something, something different in the walls, that something was about to happen, something terrrible. There was no time to contemplate this, as her regular visitors had arrived to deliver her into another day of her own personal hell.
