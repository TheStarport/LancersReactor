			<div class="content">Darkstone dropped out of hyperspace just above Tatooine. The dry and arid planet was inhospitable at time, while other time, just like home. Darkstone spent a few year here while training. He hated the sand though. He had learned much here about survival. His father was thorough. Like himself had grown up here as well as did his grandfather. The Huts, well, they did not survive here past Jabba. When he died out on the due sea, the others decided to give this planet a wide berth. Climate since the rebirth of the republic, had changed for gangsters. 
<br />
<br />He nosed the craft to the space port of Mos Eisley. He was early in the Tatooine morning. Traffic was light. He might be able to get in and out without being noticed. After touching down, he had R2 handle some repairs and keep an eye on the ship. R2 whistled his affirmation to the task. He pulled his Jedi hood over his head and headed in the direction of the cantina. His meeting was to be held there. 
<br />
<br />Even for the morning, the patrons of the place were well into their drinks. Darkstone scanned the crowds. His face a neutral expression. He did not want to draw any undue attention just yet. There would still be many that would relish taking out a Jedi. Of course, very few ever succeeded. But that did not stop them from trying. Han was no where to be seen. Darkstone would wait. He ordered a drink and sat in a corner booth to wait. He had to arrange his thoughts and what he would say to Han. To much information, and Han could shut down in disbelief. But, he would be patient. He needed this information very badly. It could help him reach his target faster.  
<br />
<br />Two hours into the waiting, a bounty hunter named Mott ambled into the bar. A quick scan of the room, he stopped and stared at the Jedi. He moved to the bar for a drink and a little information. He wanted to gather all the information on the subject before engaging him.  You survived longer that way. He had light armed on and a mask that covered his face only to the bridge of his nose. It did nothing for the ridged fore head and the deep gash that appeared to cross his face from ear to ear. He was armed with a cross bow slung on his back. Only a small blaster was strapped to his hip.
<br />
<br />He took his drink and moved around the room, tying to look like another patron of the place. He stopped and observed a game on a holo table and move on. His target was reclined in the back of the booth. Eyes seemed almost asleep. This was almost too easy. The remnant offered huge rewards for the hides of Jedi. He could feel the coin already in his pocket. He slowly drew the crossbow form his shoulder and powered it up. A couple of patrons saw him coming and realized what he was doing and moved clear of the field of fire. They wanted nothing to do with squabbles. 
<br />
<br />The Jedi seemed to not notice as the figure stopped at his booth. The bow caster now aimed at the Jedi, finger on the trigger, attempting to squeeze it. Nothing happened. The bounty hunter found himself unable to move, yet he was being lifted from the floor. He was a good meter of the ground when the Jedi looked up at him. &#8220;Is there something I can do for you&#8221; was Darkstone&#8217;s reply to the man. A smile spread across his face. 
<br />
<br />The bounty hunter found himself flung across the room and into the wall, he bowcaster on the floor near the booth. He fought to his feet, drawing his blaster even as the bartender was yelling for no blaster. Before the first shot was fired, an intense blade arced out, poised to deflect it. The first shot hit the floor, the second hit the wall near the shooter, the third hit the shooter. Then, without anyone reaching to help, the blaster was torn from the mans hand and landed in the Jedi&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I spared your life once, I won&#8217;t do it again&#8221;Darkstone spoke, anger creeping into his voice. &#8220;Find yourself another target, my friend.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />The bounty hunter nodded and headed out of the cantina. He bumped into an old man on the way out. Apologizing, he kept his pace. The man just shook his head and moved to the booth that Darkstone had sat back down at. &#8220;Seems like old times again&#8221; Han spoke a smile on his face, &#8220;Your father and Ben Kenobi were here so many years ago and seemed to have the same run in., must run in the family eh, Kid?&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />He slide into the booth beside Darkstone, pulling out some pages from a notebook. Han began to explain the information he had been able to gather, though, it wasn&#8217;t what he had hopped for. He explained that he was sorry not to have more for Darkstone. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone just sat, trying to compose his questions, &#8220;Do you remember when I was little?&#8221;
<br />
<br />That brought a smile to Han&#8217;s face. &#8220;Yeah, I do, you were rambunksious.&#8221; That brought laugh from Darkstone. &#8220;What&#8217;s this all about&#8221;, Han asked, as if the memory sobered him
<br />
<br />Darkstone decided to dive in and began to explain all and to tell Han of his theories. 
<br />
<br />The hours went by. Han, angry one moment, teary eyed the next. Disbelief in his old eyes. It was hard for him to hear it all, but, to his credit, he did hear Darkstone out. He knew that Lea had hid some things from him years ago, and now, he had answers to those questions that had nagged him for so long. Finally, he just broke down. Darkstone move closer and put a hand on his shoulder. Trying to comfort a dear friend. He needed the information, but knew he would have to wait a bit to get it, though, now he had pieced some of the things together.
<br />
<br />By the end of th day, Darkstone had the pieces put together and was ready to put a plan together for a family reunion. One that may mean the end of the Skywalker family altogether. The remaining to people from the line of Anakin Skywalker would meet again, in battle.

			<div class="content">The hours went by. Han, angry one moment, teary eyed the next. Disbelief in his old eyes. It was hard for him to hear it all, but, to his credit, he did hear Darkstone out. He knew that Lea had hid some things from him years ago, and now, he had answers to those questions that had nagged him for so long. Finally, he just broke down. Darkstone move closer and put a hand on his shoulder. Trying to comfort a dear friend. He needed the information, but knew he would have to wait a bit to get it, though, now he had pieced some of the things together.
<br />
<br />By the end of the day, Darkstone had the pieces put together and was ready to put a plan together for a family reunion. One that may mean the end of the Skywalker family altogether. The remaining to people from the line of Anakin Skywalker would meet again, in battle.
<br />
<br />Darth sycho_warrior, having draw more dark energy, was headed back to the Death Star. Her Sith cruiser, newly created, was just minuets away from dropping out of hyperspace. She was on the bridge as the ship decelerated. The site was impressive. More work had been completed than she had anticipated. She had already gone over the reports that were sent hourly to her. The main weapon, was now functional. 
<br />
<br />The docking bay had been alerted to her arrival. A regiment of troops were on hand and in formation for her arrival. She had guards, but they were for show only. As with the former emperor, they were dressed in all red, blood red. They obeyed her without question. Little was know of what race they were of. Or even is the were not machines. 
<br />
<br />The ship, retros fired, settled down gently on the deck. The site of over fifteen squadrons of defender Tie&#8217;s in formation, circling the death star at the equator, was impressive to all that saw it. Those of the remnant, who had served under Palpatine, were reminded of the awesome power that commanded such respect and fear. They also wanted power and position in the new Empire that was soon to rise. 
<br />
<br />The Dark Lord, pulled the hood over her head and waited for the hatch to open. Hee guard, began the descent down the ramp. They took up formation, half to the left and half to the right of the ramp. The dark Master began her descent as well. Fear, a strong a feeling as could be, spread across the deck. The clone troopers held position, but the officers were getting nervous. They looked left and right, despite being at the position of attention. They wanted to beg for mercy. A weakness that would eliminate them. The figure strode onward. When she reached the turbo shaft, it opened for her and Darth Neo_Kuja stepped off and knelt be fore her. &#8220;Rise my servant and accompany me&#8221; was the command given. Neo_kuja turned and stepped back on the lift behind his master.
<br />
<br />As the door slid shut, the Officer in charge dismissed the men and soldiers. He headed towards his quarters. He had not received any orders to the bridge, so he had no desire to step into anything right now. He passed many troops and officers. The faces of the officers, showed concern, but also elation of the pending victory for the new Empire. His confidence, began to grow, maybe, he though, it could work.
<br />
<br />The lift slowed to a stop. The sith, alone in the lift, power flowing, washing over them. The door slid back. The chamber, circular in lay out, afforded a three hundred and sixty degree view of the stars. Such darkness only enhanced the feel there. To over see an Empire, that was sycho_warrior&#8217;s destiny, and she relished it. Her plans were unfolding, even now. She had learned of the republic fleets defeat, but would not underestimate them. 
<br />
<br />She moved with purpose to the meditation area. There she meditated on the darkside. She used what was taught to her by her old master, Luke Skywalker. But she also used something else. Rage! It fueled her search for the darkside power even more. Her anger at being deceived, that finished off the turn to the darkside. For not being told that her parents had been alive, that one of them, her very own mother, was apart of the deception. She never got the chance to love or be loved, but was rejected out of fear. Pretending that she was orphaned, the anger rose within her even now. She relished it even more. Her eyes flashed fire.
<br />
<br />Then, while she sought the visions that directed her, they were not from her, but from another. One who was once apart of the force, but was now gone. The power remained and she tapped into it. It drove her, burned within her veins. Now, the vision returned, and image appeared before here. It was an image of a man, but one that she felt was an enemy. He was young, but powerful. She had seen him before, but could not recall his name.
<br />
<br />This drove her more, to know who this was, who she must defeat to be in total power and control, of the new Empire. She would be, no, will be, ruler of the new Empire and it&#8217;s new dark master. She, would return the sith to power again. The jedi, would me destroyed, once and for all. There would be no survivors this time. She laughed within herself at the prospect.  She reached for th console and signaled for Commander Indy to join her here. A plan of destruction, was being formulated.

A plan of destruction, was being formulated. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone took his X-wing fighter and headed to the dark cave on Tatooine. After shutting down he had R2D2 send a signal, coded towards the Yavin system. Darkstone knew that if it was sent to the Dark Master, then either she or her apprentice would come to check it out. He hoped for the Dark Lord herself, but would settle for the apprentice as that wold allow him a chance to eliminate one of the sith. He needed something to bait them out. He included one word, Master. That would get their curiosity enough.
<br />
<br />The sith were in the chamber over looking the expanse of space when a message was relaid to them. The dark one punched up a button on the console and saw the one word. She then looked at the trace and saw Tatooine. Who would know anyone was here, let alone her. Had security failed in someway? Someone would pay for this error. She would see to it. But, as to the message, she had her doubts as to the meaning. &#8220;Lord Neo_kuja, I am sending you to Tatooine to retrieve the body of the one who sent this message.&#8221; she said, the tone down playing the importance, &#8220;Just bring me the information, intact, after that, bring me the head of the person who sent this message.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;It shall be done, my master&#8221; he replied, bowing and then turned and left. His sith fighter would be all he would need to take.
<br />
<br />Standing, gazing out at the stars, sycho_warrior wondered at the meaning or purpose of such a message. She could not sense anything in the force. Nothing at all. It troubled her a bit, that anyone could know her whereabouts or that the fleet was here. This could mean trouble to the plan she had in place. She gave a command to remove the fleet to a neighboring star system. She would remain here with the Death Star and five extra squadrons of fighters. They would be ample protection for her and the station. 
<br />
<br />The Sith fighter, swift in its journey, reached Tatooine in no time. The Dark Servant circled the planet, trying to get a fix in the force on the quarry. He could only feel a slight disturbance near the dark cave. So, laying a course, he made for the cave. 
<br />
<br />As he moved in near the mouth of the cave, he saw only two banthas, not even any sand people. It disturbed him, but he would obey his orders without question. His master had trained him well. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone, standing just meters inside the cave, kept his meditation up. He could see the Hooded figure approaching. He did not even have his light saber drawn. It took all the discipline Darkstone had not to draw his own. He had to maintain the illusion of an empty cave until the sith was past him. He would block an escape.  Step, by step, he waited. Now, he was beside the sith, even harder to maintain it, but he did. 
<br />
<br />When the dark one was five paces beyond him, he drew and ignited his blade. Green and shimmering. Raw power humming as he swung it in a side arc to face the enemy. Neo_Kuja felt at that moment impending doom. He drew his sword and turned to stare at a Jedi. And not just any one at that, but at Darkstone. His one time class mate at the academy. And now, his mortal enemy.
<br />
<br />Darkstone made the first move, swinging to the right. As the blades clashed the hum grew louder. The student attempted to use the force to push Darkstone back, but it was anticipated and failed. Again the swing down came and was met. The flash of the contact point, bright and awesome. This time, Darkstone used the push move and succeeded. The student was pushed into a cave wall, but used it to flip back into position and bring his blade down. So close to Darkstone&#8217;s head, yet, he seemed to lack the skill to truly wheeled the sword as it should be.
<br />
<br />Thus, combat began. Paring, thrust, deflect. Each focused on the objective. To defeat the other. Gradually, the student began to get the upper hand. Less of his blows countered. Darkstone his face a subtle mask of confidence. He was forced to give ground, until he was near to being backed into a wall. 
<br />
<br />Now, the fire rose in Darkstone&#8217;s eyes. His sword blade vanished and he stood, facing death, a surprise on Neo_kuja&#8217;s face. With renewed energy and confidence, Neo_kuja brought the sword around in a high arc, a death arc meant to cleave his opponent in half. One that stopped inches from Darkstone&#8217;s face. Neo_kuja could not make it move, he could not even with draw the sword. It was locked in an iron grip. Fear began to grow inside him. He had never faced such power, not even from his master. 
<br />
<br />The movement came slowly, as if in animation. The blade ,red and menacing,  turned loose from it&#8217;s owners hand and began to turn in a small circle arc, inching towards its target, the students neck. He saw with horror what was coming, yet now even he could not move. He watched as the blade neared his neck. It seemed to take minuets, but was over in less than a second. Darth Neo_kuja&#8217;s head lay on the cave floor, the sword, switched off now, lay beside it. He had been defeated and yet, even as the last thought left his head, he wondered how he had lost, then darkness.
