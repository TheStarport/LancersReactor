			<div class="content">Terranova: &quot;Affirmative. What do you care?&quot;
<br />
<br />Psawhn: I am in a position to intercept your target. Would you like assistance?
<br />
<br />Quigley overheard the exchange and keyed his mike.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Freelancer three dash nine, this is the Cerulean Dream.  We'd appreciate any help you can muster.  We're in pursuit of a Starflier, Sigma three dash two.
<br />
<br />Psawhn: Got his trajectory.  Uplinking to your neural net.
<br />
<br />Quigley saw a waypoint appear on his nav map.  The point was one 100+ klicks about, but Danson had to be along that line.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Terra, Connor, I've got a trajectory.  Form up on me. 
<br />
<br />Quigley activated his cruise engine and slewed his fighter in line with point.  The other two stayed in perfect formation.  The other two pilots flew wierd craft he'd never seen before.  Terra seemed to be flying a cobbled together wreck probably held together with spit and space tape.  Connor, on the other hand, flew a well- engineered heavy fighter.  Quigley's cpu could pin the type, but it looked a lot like the Liberty Defender.
<br />
<br />Psawhn:  Dream, what did this poor sap do to get you guys and that Drake on his tail?
<br />
<br />Quigley cursed.  A Drake?  He had flown with a flew Kusari snubjockies.  They were decidedly of the opinion to shoot first and let the Junkers sort it out.
<br />
<br />Quigley:  That poor sap is a former client of mine.  He neglected to pay.  I came looking for him, and he bolted.  I don't want him slagged.  I just want to calm him down and get my credits.  I hope he doesn't do anything stupid and get himself killed.  Your welcome to join us if you want.
<br />
<br />Psawhn: Don't mind if I do.

<br />
<br />Thinking: Capture him alive, eh? Well, I think I just might have a plan. 
<br />
<br />*After cruising to a spot ahead of where the bandit was supposed to be, Psawhn shut down all power systems except for his weapons - including his shields. Hopefully with reduced energy emissions he could pass undetected until the bandit was in firing range. Then he would first bring down its shields, then target the bandit's engines with his stunpulse. If things went down to plan, the ship would be immobilized. He would let the neuralnet do the targetting, for he didn't think he could pinpoint a half-metre wide spot on a ship going three hundred metres per second.
<br />
<br />*He only had to wait a minute before the startracker (!1) appeared on passive scanners.*
<br /><b>Psawhn:  </b>(Muttering)There you are... 
<br />*As soon as the bandit was 600m away, he opened fire.*
<br />
<br />(!1)<i>OOC: Which is it? Startracker or flier? I think a Startracker, because a starflier is a bit too easy... </i>
<br />OOC: Oh, we should all remove our sigs when posting in the thread, eh? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Lutz entered the equipment dealers, to find a man with a nice smile on his face. 
<br />
<br />EqD: Ahh.. Ser Lutz... A pleasure to see you. We have fully outfitted your coolant system, it's all working now. May I suggest laying off the guns for bit? Also 10 bats and bots have been installed too. Should see you safley off. There was a bit of money left over from the sale of the turret you sold me, I'm uploading complete transaction details into your Neural net now.
<br />
<br />*Lutz reads the receipt, he's received 493 credits, all the money he has*
<br />Lutz: My thanks, I will no doubt see you again when I'm in the area
<br />*Lutz shakes EqD's hand*
<br />Lutz: Can you prep her for launch? I'm gonna get outta here
<br />EqD: With resepect, that isn't possible. The landing platform for this side of the station was just raized by some idiot. The plating is turned up. It is currently being repaired, and should be completed within the hour.
<br />
<br />Lutz grunted as the equipment dealer walked off. At least it would give Michael a chance to catch up with Arrigoni. He should see them about soon.
<br />He uploaded the flight plan he'd need to get to this research station in his ships nav com, and settled down to wait.
<br />
<br />OCC: Gonna have to dash for a while, should hopefully be one more post from me tonight. Nickless have fun in mean time. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Arrigoni looked at his glas.
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: Well, I don't think anyone will be leaving soon, When I was outside looking for you two, I saw the landing pad was being repaired.
<br />Michael: In that case, I'd better check up on my ship. See if all is fixed. If you make-up your mind, I'll be in the equipment room.
<br />
<br />*get's up and walkes to Equipment dealer*
<br />
<br />Michael to EqD: So. have you been able to fix it?
<br />EqD: Sure, it's been ready for about 45 minutes now. It's right over there by that defender.
<br />
<br />Michael pays the man and goes to investigate his ship. Not that he didn't trust the Equipment dealer, but just for his own comfort.
<br />He takes a peak at the defender as he passes it, and sees Lutz, sitting inside his cockpit.
<br />
<br />Michael: Hey Lutz, haven't you heard? The landing pad is out of order. No need to get in there.
<br />
<br />*Lutz peaking over the edge and looking down on Michael*
<br />
<br />Lutz: I know, some guy screwed up big time. Any luck on Arrigoni?
<br />Michael: I don't know if he's comming along. I left him because I needed to check up on my ship. See if the engineer did what I payed him for.
<br />Lutz, while getting out of his ship: No, I meant, any luck on finding out why he's here?
<br />Michael: No, not really. He asked me first. Saw my face on the contract list, and took a wild guess.
<br />Lutz: Well, you were the big event at that time. Not likely anyone would soon forget.
<br />Michael changes the subject: So, where we heading?

			<div class="content">Quigley was speechless.  Everybody had heard of cloaking devices, but no one thought they were possible.  Also no one expected to ever see one.  The shock of seeing a Liberty cruiser uncloak before him hadn't passed before the shock of seeing the same cruiser open fire on Danson's fighter.  The Starflier's engines erupted, and the light fighter was sent spinning.
<br />
<br />Still speechless, Quigley throttled up his fighter and roared in front of cruiser, trying to get to Danson before he sustained any more damage.  As he closed on Danson, Quigley saw the front of the fighter flare as the escape pod jettisoned from the crippled ship.  Quigley locked on to Danson's pod and tractored him into his hold.  
<br />
<br />Quigley dived behind asteriod to hide from the crusier's turrets.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Unidentified capitol ship, this is the Cerulean Dream.  Your actions are hostile.  Explain yourself or you will be fired upon.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Terranova, Connor, are you all okay?
<br />
<br />Connor: Roger, everyone's after your guy.
<br />
<br />Terranova: Quigley, Connor and I are outside the cruiser's range.  Do you want use to set up for a torp run?
<br />
<br />Quigley: Set up, but let's give this maniac a second to answer hails.

			<div class="content">*At first, Psawhn didn't realize exactly <i>why </i> his shots stopped short halfway to their intended target, but then gasped in shock as a massive object filled his view - seemingly out of nowhere.*
<br />
<br /><i>Oh... $***! </i>
<br />
<br />*He quickly engaged his thrusters and shields, and tore towards the nearby asteroid field. He didn't know if the cruiser was friendly or hostile, but he didn't want to be sitting a mere two hundred metres away in case it was the latter.
<br />
<br />*After the couple of seconds needed to make it to the asteroid field, Psawhn cut his engines then turned around to get a better look at the ship.
<br />
<br />*It looked similar to a Liberty Cruiser, but that was mainly due to the main gun on the front that was Liberty's signature. Its profile didn't match anything in the ship's database.*
<br />
<br /><b>Radio </b>: Quigley, Connor and I are outside the cruiser's range. Do you want us to set up for a torp run?
<br />
<br /><b>Quigley: </b> Set up, but let's give this maniac a second to answer hails.
<br />
<br />*Psawhn doubted that a single torpedo run by two ships would be able to take this cruiser down. Judging by the way his scanner had difficulty penetrating its hull, it looked like there had been extensive armour upgrades onto it.
<br />
<br />*He decided to wait a bit longer, seeing how things would turn out.*
<br />
<br />(OOC: How <i>DID </i> that cruiser ignore Psawhn at that distance? Yes, his reduced emissions might cause him to be ignored by a fleeing man, but a cloaked, diliberate cruiser? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)</div>

			<div class="content">OCC: Knight, it's Quigley.  As in Quigley Down Under?  I love that movie.
<br />
<br />ICC:
<br />
<br />Quigley was the last in to the cruiser's fighter bay.  The landing pad was pretty crowded with the cruiser's escorts, Terranova's cobbled Widdowmaker, Connor's mysterious heavy fighter, and Pswahn's Dragon.  Luckily, a Patriot doesn't need much room.  Quigley set down and shut down his systems.
<br />
<br />Climbing out of the cockpit, Quigley saw his three companions talking to each other, keeping an eye on the landing bay personnel.  Quigley keyed his hold doors open as he dropped to the deck.  He walked to the open hold.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Danson? Are you...
<br />
<br />Before he could finish the question a stream of laser bolts shot out from the hold.  Quigley rolled to the side and came up with his Daumman needler pistol in his hand.  He surveyed the bay.  Everyone had produced a weapon of some type and was behind cover.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Danson, don't you shoot up my hold.
<br />
<br />Danson: Stayy bback.  I'll shoot the next person I see.
<br />
<br />Quigley: No one wants you dead yet.  Now, throw out that hoglead and come out.  We can talk.
<br />
<br />A blaster flew out of the hold and clattered across the deck.  Danson, a nervous middle-aged, balding man, stumbled out of the door.</div>
