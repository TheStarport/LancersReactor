<br />
<br />
<br />Introduction
<br />
<br />
<br />It had been 6 months since Trent, The Order, Halap, the Dom Kavash and the five houses had eliminated the threat of the Nomads. The Sirius Sector had been freed of the biggest threat it had known for over 800 years.
<br />
<br />
<br />After the destruction of the Nomad City, everyone involved went back to their normal lives.
<br />
<br />King had returned to Liberty and continued working for the LSF. King was the instigator in stepping up actions against the Liberty Rogues and Xenos in Manhatten space.
<br />
<br />Lord Hakkera resigned from his position of prefect of Honshu and decided to leave for the somewhat tranquil setting of the Blood Dragon base Kyoto, away from the busy life of Honshu.
<br />
<br />Herr Von Claussen returned to Bundschuh Base Bruchsal. He chose reclusion over fame and his heroics in the second war had somewhat lifted the tension and strain he was under by the Rheinland Government.
<br />
<br />Orillion remained on the Osiris in orbit of Toledo. Research Base Hathor acted as the first line of contact from the Hyper Gate system, should anything decide to pass through.
<br />
<br />Professor Quintaine and Dr Sinclair returned to Cambridge and were two of only a select handful of people that were given access to the Dom Kavash settlers on Sprague in Omega-3.
<br />
<br />Juni and Trent however decided to settle down after coming back from Hawaii. Juni retired from her position in the LSF and they both lived of the credits that Trent had amassed in the first Nomad incursion.
<br />
<br />They decided to leave the busy life style of Manhatten and moved to Planet Kyushu in the Kyushu System. The toned down lifestyle enabled Trent and Juni to relax and as Juni had family in the system, Trent had no objections.
<br />
<br />
<br />The destruction of the Nomads had brought about much change within the houses as funding was increased to examine the threat of other potential alien species to Sirius. The Order had their funding increased ten fold as their perfect track record against the Nomads had proven them worthy of the control and exploration of the hyper gate systems and beyond the frontiers of Sirius. 
<br />
<br />The threat of other hostile species incursions was not taken for granted. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 1 &#8211; Old Friends </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is The Hood, welcome Mr Trent and Ms Zane, you are cleared for docking&#8221;
<br />
<br />Juni and Trent had arrived on the Hood. They had come to visit the only man who could call Trent his family, Tobias. 
<br />
<br />Tobias had remained on the Hood after the second wars as it made its way back to the Dublin System. Hovis continued to run his gambling operation from the Hood.
<br />
<br />They were meeting Tobias in the bar. He was sitting at the table closest to the window so he could watch the races.
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni walked over.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ah Trent, its good to see you boy!&#8221; Said Tobias. &#8220;And I see you&#8217;ve brought the missus!&#8221; he said laughing.
<br />
<br />Juni shook her head laughing. Tobias was never going to change his way with words.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You too old man&#8221; replied Trent with a smile.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Its nice for this old man to still have company&#8221; said Tobias.
<br />
<br />&#8220;How have you been?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very well. It is certainly more exciting here than in that equipment dealer on Leeds that&#8217;s for sure!&#8221; replied Tobias. &#8220;What do you two have planned now?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re going to take it easy for a while. Honshu is a beautiful place&#8221; Trent replied.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Tobias &#8220;Its about time you two settled down wasn&#8217;t it!?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni laughed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;With him? No way&#8221; replied Juni laughing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Huh, like that is it!&#8221; replied Trent smiling.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So, have you anything planned after you leave here?&#8221; asked Tobias.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see King on Pittsburgh. He misses his drinking partner!&#8221; said Juni looking cheekily at Trent.
<br />
<br />Trent wasn&#8217;t paying any attention to Juni&#8217;s comment, the vibrate alert on his neural net alarm was warning him of an incoming transmission.
<br />
<br />Juni looked puzzlingly at Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; she asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Huh? Nothing, someone trying to get hold of me that&#8217;s all&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />Juni&#8217;s alert started to go off as well.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of this&#8221; said Trent. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be long&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent left the table and made his way down to the docking bay. His gleaming Anubis stood out amongst the IMG Daggers. The workmanship of Halap and the Dom Kavash was magnificent. Trent and Juni&#8217;s Anubis&#8217;s had caught the eye of several IMG personnel.
<br />
<br />Trent thought about what Halap had done for him and Sirius. The bravery of the Dom Kavash stood high in his memory, along with Captain Walker and Lieutenant Ozu. 
<br />
<br />Trent opened the cockpit and switched on his neural net.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent here&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, its King&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey King, whats up? We still up for latter. Pittsburgh right?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Change of plans Trent&#8221; replied King. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be able to meet you and Juni on Pittsburgh as planned&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why whats wrong?&#8221; asked Trent
<br />
<br />&#8220;Not over the comms. I&#8217;m downloading co ordinates into both you and Juni&#8217;s neural nets now. Come as soon as you can. See you soon buddy. King out&#8221;
<br />
<br />The communications channel went dead. It was unlike King to move locations on such short notice. Trent looked at the co ordinates in his neural net.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sprague?&#8221; he said to himself.
<br />
<br />The only two people he knew that had clearance to Sprague were Quintaine and Sinclair. Not even Orillion was allowed access.
<br />
<br />The Dom Kavash colony on Sprague had flourished since the end of the war. No amount of credits could ever get himself and Juni even close to Omega-3 to visit their old friends.
<br />
<br />Trent left the docking bay and made his way back to the bar. Juni and Tobias were still sitting there.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sorry old man, we have to depart&#8221; said Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now?&#8221; asked Juni. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Who was it trying to contact us?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;It was King&#8221; replied Trent. &#8220; We have to meet him now&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Omega-3&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s restricted space&#8221; said Tobias.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;How are we supposed to get in there?&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s all that King said&#8221;
<br />
<br />Juni turned to look at Tobias.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It was good to see you again Tobias. We&#8217;ll be back soon&#8221; she said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You too my dear&#8221; replied Tobias. He turned to look at Trent. &#8220;Stay out of trouble boy&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I will. We&#8217;ll come back soon&#8221; replied Trent. Tobias stood up and gave Trent a hug.
<br />
<br />Juni and Trent both left to make their way down to the docking bay.
<br />

<br />
<br />Anyway, Chapter 2 is completed now. Not going to get much time to do chapter 3 today but hopefully tomorrow. So until then, here is Chapter 2.
<br />
<br />Enjoy<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 2 &#8211; Homeworlds </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mr Trent, Ms Zane, you are cleared for launch, good flying&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni cleared The Hood.
<br />
<br />The secrecy surrounding Kings transmission was puzzling Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;And he didn&#8217;t haven&#8217;t anything else to say?&#8221; she asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No&#8221; replied Trent. &#8220;He said to fly to Sprague and that&#8217;s it&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni&#8217;s Anubis&#8217;s were well known throughout the colonies. The blue DKV Anubis was unmissable and as such was enough to guarantee their safe passage all the way to the new Aldershot station at the jump gate to Omega-3.
<br />
<br />The BAF build up around the jump gate was huge. I good proportion of the Bretonian military was stationed on or around Aldershot Station. On any normal day, the military would have opened fire on Juni and Trent, so it came as a surprise to them as to why they didn&#8217;t.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mr Trent, Ms Zane, this is Aldershot Station. We have been expecting you. Please proceed through the Jump Gate&#8221;
<br />
<br />A military Crusader approached them just before the Jump Gate.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Welcome Mr Trent. I am to escort you and Ms Zane to your co ordinates2 said an unfamiliar voice over the comms channel. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My name is James Parkin&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Its good to meet you Parkin. Shall we proceed?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes Mr Trent. I&#8217;ll take point. Please follow me&#8221;
<br />
<br />Parkin jumped through the gate followed shortly after by Trent and Juni.
<br />
<br />On the other side, strange ships were patrolling Omega-3. Trent, Juni and Parkin cut their engines.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry Mr Trent, you and Ms Zane are quite safe here. After all Mr Trent, you were the first human the Dom Kavash met&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;These are Dom Kavash ships?&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes they are&#8221; replied Parkin. &#8220;Hard workers aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Indeed&#8221; said Trent.
<br />
<br />A few of the Dom Kavash ships that were patrolling the jump gate flew over and cut their engines. 
<br />
<br />The Dom Kavash looked as though they were a cross between a Dagger and a Drone. They had the same hull design as Trent and Juni&#8217;s Anubis&#8217;s and were very different to the attack vessels the Dom Kavash had used only 6 months ago.
<br />
<br />The lead ship opened up comms link with Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent. My name is Omaelia. On behalf of the Dom Kavash, I welcome you as a friend of our species and to our home&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you. It is my pleasure to be here. But, how did you know me?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We have the memories of the Elders of our people. We know everything about you and how you helped us&#8221; replied Omaelia.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, err, that&#8217;s good. Thanks&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Omaelia opened channels to Parkin and Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Will you please follow me. We are to meet the others on Sprague&#8221;
<br />
<br />The four ships hit cruise speed and soon approached the old Freeport 1. It had Dom Kavash armour over it and looked as though it had been converted.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What happened to Freeport 1?&#8221; Trent asked Parkin.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Dom Kavash converted it to a Ship Yard. The Zoners were non too pleased at leaving!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I can imagine&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />It wasn&#8217;t long before the four ships approached Sprague. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent look at that!&#8221; said Juni amazed. &#8220;Its beautiful&#8221;
<br />
<br />Blue and Purple glows could be seen on the surface of the once white planet. 
<br />
<br />It wasn&#8217;t the glow emanating from the planet that had Trent&#8217;s attention. It was the six ships in orbit of Sprague that had Trent&#8217;s attention. The Rheinland Cruiser Weimar, the Rheinland Chancellors flag ship, the Liberty Cruiser Phoenix, the flagship of the new Liberty Ambassador and former President, Jacobi, the Kusari Battleship Osaka, flagship to Emperor Miakawa, the Hispanic Cruiser Bilbao, flagship to the Hispanic diplomat and the Bretonian Cruiser Buckingham, Queen Carina&#8217;s flagship. 
<br />
<br />The final ship in orbit of Sprague was one that Trent and Juni knew all to well, the Order Battleship Osiris. 
<br />
<br />The sight of the House flagships and the Osiris was sending numerous thoughts through Trent&#8217;s head. Why were the big names meeting here in Sprague rather than Curacao?  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, is everything ok&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Huh, what? Oh sorry Juni, I&#8217;m fine&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />Juni had caught site of the ships a coupled with Kings secretive transmission, she had no idea what to think. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We are here. Please proceed down to the surface, I will meet you there shortly&#8221; said Omaelia.
<br />
<br />She activated the Dom Kavash docking ring and Trent, Juni and Parkin made their way down to the planets surface.</div>

			<div class="content">Bret, nice job.  But still, left me with questions...<img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  But I know what it is like.  I still don't know what will hapen in my stories, it is just part of being a writer.  You make it up as you go along, which is why it is so much fun.  Using words to attempt to paint a picture in someone else's mind, and hoping that it is the same as the one in your mind, that is what writing is about.
<br />Another great chapter to another great story!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle><img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle><img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Ok as promised, have been working on chapter 3 today and it is now finished. Long one this although nothing like the last few chapters in SOS. Thanks for the great comments again. No ETA on 4 at the moment. I have a busy week ahead and will work on it as soon as i get some free moments. 
<br />
<br />So enjoy this for now<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Chapter 3 &#8211; Mysteries </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />The descent down through Sprague&#8217;s atmosphere was a rough ride. Only after clearing it could Juni, Trent and Parkin see clearly what good be seen form space.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wow, its amazing!&#8221; said Trent.
<br />
<br />In only six months the Dom Kavash had completely transformed Sprague from almost nothing to a large sprawling city that covered a good percentage of the planet.
<br />
<br />Although all of the structure was noticeable, the building that stood out most was the giant pyramid like structure just off of the landing bay. It was a tall, blue glowing pyramid with flashing green lights going down the sides of it in sequence. The landing pad itself was also a sight. The same green lights that could be found on the pyramid circled the pad. 
<br />
<br />The pyramid took centre stage of all buildings in sight and the glistening purple diamond at the top produced a glow to light up much of the surrounding area.
<br />
<br />The three ships landed on the pad and two Dom Kavash guards were waiting for them. Omaelia landed shortly after.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Will the three of you please follow me&#8221; said Omaelia.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Over there&#8221; replied Omaelia pointing at the pyramid.
<br />
<br />Trent, Juni, Parkin and Omaelia started the short walk to the Pyramid.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is amazing Omaelia!&#8221; said Juni. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;It is a symbol of our architect. It also reminds us of how our species used to live&#8221;
<br />
<br />The path to the pyramid was long and straight. Considering the size of the city, there was no one else along it.
<br />
<br />At the entrance of the pyramid, a huge door reminiscent of the one&#8217;s in the Dom Kavash mother ship opened as the four approached. Inside the structure was even more beautiful than the city outside.
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni walked in open mouthed.
<br />
<br />A deep dark purple marble effect made up the floor and directly in front was a 10 feet high water fountain in the centre. It was completely yellow with a red light at the bottom which made the water sparkle. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Come, this way&#8221; said Omaelia.
<br />
<br />She took them down a passage to the left of the fountain to what looked like a dead end.
<br />
<br />A huge plate lowered itself from a hole above. Trent was hesitant about getting on it after the last time he stepped on a Dom Kavash plate.
<br />
<br />Once everyone was on the plate, it slowly raised as Trent, Omaelia, Juni and Parkin were all raised to a much higher level.
<br />
<br />The plate stopped and the corridor ahead of them was much like the on they had just come down. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We are almost there&#8221; said Omaelia.
<br />
<br />In front was another large Dom Kavash door. It opened to reveal a very large table in the centre. Familiar and important faces were around the room including King, Orillion, Hakkera and Herr Von Claussen not to mention the political figures who had left their ships in orbit of Sprague.
<br />
<br />Orillion came over to meet Trent and Juni. Parkin walked over to Queen Carina and her envoy of Bretonian guard. Omaelia left the room by a door opposite the one they came through.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, Juni its good to see you again&#8221; said Orillion. He signalled for Hakkera, Von Claussen and King to come over.
<br />
<br />Everyone looked very glum. The mood in the room was seemingly low. Both Trent and Juni noticed it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We don&#8217;t know ourselves&#8221; said Orillion. &#8220;I was summoned here by the Elders and asked to bring senior Order staff with me. As King had contact with you, I asked him to signal for the two of you&#8221;
<br />
<br />Another set of doors opened up 90 degrees to the table. There were doors on all four sides of the square room.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Please be seated&#8221; Said Omaelia as she came through the door.
<br />
<br />Everyone in the room made their way and sat at the table. Orillion, King, Trent, Hakkera, Von Claussen and Juni sat down as group on the table. Everyone else remained in the house groups. They all sat in silence looking at one another.
<br />
<br />Three red robe wearing Dom Kavash came through the door that Omaelia was standing by and took their place with her at the head of the table. Everyone was looking at them waiting for some one to say something.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am Chief Elder Ganesh. I would like to welcome you all here today&#8221; began Ganesh.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I can sense you are all puzzled by your summoning and presence here. I would like to begin to explain the urgency of this meeting&#8221;
<br />
<br />Still, no one in the room had any idea.
<br />
<br />&#8220;As you all can see, we have settled here very quickly, we offer our thanks to each of you for allowing this to be possible and for the freedom we have in this system. You will also all be aware that we have created our own ships and transports and we now have our own weapons program and training. We will be in more favourable position to help you as a species should the need arise again. Which is why you have been summoned here&#8221;
<br />
<br />The look on everyone&#8217;s faces was that of concern.
<br />
<br />Ganesh continued.
<br />
<br />&#8220;On the northern hemisphere of this planet, we created a scanner infinitely more powerful than anything ever created. It has the ability to scan outside of the Sirius borders to an extent. Earlier today, we picked up what appeared to be a distress call 100k west of your Tau-23&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s outside the barrier&#8221; said Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes Trent, we know. Which is why we have brought you all here today. We have records of all the frequencies that each house and faction uses. This was not one of them&#8221;
<br />
<br />Mumbling and groaning started in the room for a few moments and then it went quite.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Do we have any idea what it has originated from?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No&#8221; replied Ganesh.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Is it Nomads?&#8221; asked Ambassador Jacobi.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t appear to be&#8221; replied Ganesh.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then what or who is it?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s what we need to find out. We think that volunteers from each house, including Omaelia and two of her escorts go and find out&#8221;
<br />
<br />The talk started in the room between each house.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll go&#8221; whispered Trent to Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I want you to take two people with you&#8221; replied Orillion.
<br />
<br />Trent turned to Juni and Herr Von Claussen. King was representing Liberty with Ambassador Jacobi.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So, shall we?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Juni and Von Claussen looked at each other and nodded with acceptance.
<br />
<br />The room started to quite down again.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Have you all decided?&#8221; asked Ganesh.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Liberty is sending Michael King&#8221; said Jacobi.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Order is sending Trent, Juni and Herr Von Claussen&#8221; said Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bretonia is sending James Parkin&#8221; said Queen Carina.
<br />
<br />Rheinland, Kusari and Hispania all gave the names of one of their pilots.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good&#8221; said Ganesh. &#8220;You should all depart immediately&#8221;
<br />
<br />Ganesh and the two accompanying elders got up and left the room. Everyone else remained at the table dumbfounded by what Ganesh had had to say.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you think it is?&#8221; said Trent to Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know Trent&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Return safely&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We will&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />Everyone got up off of their chairs and made their way out of the pyramid down to their ships on the landing pad.</div>
