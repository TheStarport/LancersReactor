			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Cortez Jump Hole, Magellan System/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />Neither Edwards nor Grey could blame the pilots of the Orbital Spa and Cruise ships for being skeptical at first when they hailed the convoy, offering to escort them to Freeport 4.  Perhaps it was only after they noticed the two police vessels from each House weren't trying to blow each other to bits did they finally agree to trust them.  Altogether, their hodgepodge convoy consisted of the 20 Armored Transports, relatively well armed, eight Startrackers, and two Hawks.  Edwards hoped it would be enough to fend off any potential pirate attacks.
<br />
<br />He reached down, keying his comm to a private channel the convoy was using.  &quot;Orbital WIng, this is Liberty Police Blue 1-1.  Assume formation.  Orbital fighters, take covering positions.  Bretonia Police Red 1-1, take rear position.&quot;
<br />The Armored transports moved into position: two columns of five ships each, stacked upon another set of two colums of five ships each.  A long obelisk of Armored Transports to the far-off eye.  The Orbital Hawks and Startrackers formed a spherical formation outside the transports (the Hawks closest to the front of the convoy), providing cover should an attack come.  Constable Grey's Cavalier took the rearmost position, directly behind the transports, closing off the sphere.  Exactly opposite to the Cavalier, at the front of the formation saw Edwards' Patriot.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Orbital Spa and Cruise Sigma 1-1.  All transports report ready status.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is Orbital Spa and Cruise Delta 1-1.  Portside fighters in position.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is Orbital Spa and Cruise Delta 2-1.  Starboard fighters in position.&quot;
<br />&quot;Bretonia Police Red 1-1 here.  Rear checks out.  Ready when you are, Nathan.&quot;
<br />
<br />Edwards nodded with satisfaction.  &quot;All craft, set course for Freeport 4 and engage cruise engines on my mark.&quot;  He gave each of the pilots a moment to reach for their cruise switches.  &quot;Three... two... one... mark!&quot;  Like a carefully orchestrated symphony, a Patriot, a Cavalier, eight Startrackers, two Hawks, and 20 Armored transports engaged their cruise engines in tandem, speeding in a curving path away from the Cortez Jump Hole, bearing in mind to keep a certain distance from Mactan Base in the process.
<br />
<br />He only hoped no one noticed the high-profile convoy enough to consider attacking it.  But as experience had tought the captain, you could always expect the unexpected.

			<div class="content">Leon/Wolhound/Mactan/Outcast
<br />
<br />Leon's phone beeped. His ship's sensors told him there was a large convoy inbound.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey everyone. Large convoy near the base. Lets get em!&quot;
<br />
<br />The Rouges started cheering and rushed to the Hangar.
<br />
<br />20 Bloodhounds, 5 Daggers, 3 Rhino Assault Freighters and 3 Wolfhounds took off.
<br />
<br />&quot;There it is. Everyone gets there share.&quot;
<br />
<br />The convoy was guarded with 8 Startrackers, 3 Hawks, a Cavalier and a Patriot.
<br />The pirates opened up at long range with seeker missiles. The Startrackers  were demolished by the hail of missiles. The Hawks broke off to attack, while the Police craft stayed with the convoy. Coming into laser range, Leon opened up with 2 Raphael Lasers and 3 Usiel Lasers, quickly demolishing a Hawk. Nearby, the other Hawk exploded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Rouges, use your cruise disruptors, dont destroy the transports.&quot;
<br />
<br />The Transports were brought to a stop, but the police fighters were harder to hit, continuing on.
<br />
<br />&quot;Never mind Rouges, leave them.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Rouge Blackhawk 3 to Armoured Transports. Lower your shields and set your weapons off line. Prepare to be borded.&quot;</div>

<br />&quot;Roger that the battle ship 'Yorkshire' and its battle group will be at your location in 5 minuites keep 'em busy, fleet comm out&quot;
<br />
<br />So how to keep the rouges busy, they hadn't noticed him as he was in a dagger, he noticed they were capturing the transports and to do that the rinos needed to lower there shields. The first rino slowly lowered its self over the target
<br />&quot;Bye bye&quot; Ruch chuckeld and fired a volly of sling shot missles at the first rino, reducing it to wrecage. While the pirates were dazed he unloaded a full enery bank of hellfury fire at the second and hoped the Battleship would be here soon.........</div>

<br />Now he was headed to the leads system with food rations for Traflagar, but he saw a massive battle before him, &quot;what the....?&quot; he asked

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Magellan System/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />Edwards figured this would happen.  A convoy this large couldn't go undetected, even two sectors away from Mactan.  However, he hadn't ancitipated they'd bring this large of a fleet to intercept them, much less mostly Liberty Rogue vessels.  Things had officially gone to hell.
<br />
<br />He took a moment to reassess the situation.  All of Orbital Spa and Cruise's fighter escorts were demolished in nearly a single phalanx of missile fire.  The Hawks and Armored Transports' turrets had managed to take out about six of the 20 Bloodhounds and one of the Daggers before the Hawks were destroyed.  Another Dagger among their raiding party suddenly had turned on them, now transmitting a Bretonia Armed Forces ID tag after destroying two of the Rhinos.  And he'd just transmitted a distress call on an open channel.  No doubt a BAF task force would be here soon.  And as if that weren't odd enough, a Bounty Hunter Barracuda was now engaging in the foray.  He didn't mind the extra firepower.  As for the convoy itself, Edwards counted ten of the 20 Armored Transports had been nailed by cruise disruptors and were struggling to restart their cruise engines in the midst of defending themselves.  As for the other ten, they sped away unhindered for the last leg of their journey towards Freeport 4.
<br />
<br />Dodging another stream of laser fire, Edwards keyed his comm.  &quot;Al, what's your status?&quot;  He targeted another Bloodhound as he waited for a reply.
<br />&quot;Taken a few hits, nothing the shields can't handle,&quot; Grey replied, the sound of his Skyrails pounding away at another Bloodhound evident in the background.  &quot;Apparently there's a BAF operative that came among the raiding party.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yeah, I noticed.  Any chance he radioed for help?&quot;
<br />Grey gave a small cheer across the channel as he vaped the Bloodhound he was attacking.  &quot;BPA and BAF channels don't run in tandem, but they're close in frequency.  I'm pretty sure I heard enough bits and pieces of his transmission to know he contacted a battleship for assistance.&quot;
<br />&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Edwards thought grimly.  Not that he wouldn't mind the help dealing with the pirate attackers, but he hadn't hoped this thing would turn out primarily in Bretonia's favor.  The last thing Magellan needed right now was a capital ship from either side breaching the Independent Systems line once more.
<br />&quot;I wouldn't worry too much, Nate,&quot; Grey said as he pressed the attack on another Bloodhound, easily ravaging it to spare parts.  &quot;I'm sure the big guns would-&quot;  Grey was cut off as an alarm sounded in his cockpit over the channel.  &quot;BLOODY HELL!&quot;
<br />
<br />Edwards turned his fighter just in time to see a pair of Javelin Missiles streak past Grey's Cavalier.  Grey had dropped enough countermeasure flares to throw off the missiles, but he was disoriented, trying to figure out who fired the missiles at him.  Edwards was equally confused and looked up, checking his scopes as well.  Then he saw it.  A flight of three Liberty Navy Defenders.  And they were bearing down on  Grey.  Just great.  Angrily, he keyed his comm to an open Liberty frequency.
<br />
<br />&quot;Attention Liberty Navy Defenders!  This is Liberty Police Blue 1-1, Captain Nathan Edwards speaking.  Disengage your attack on the Bretonian Cavalier!  He is an ally, I repeat, he's helping defend the convoy.  If you want to help us out, feel free to attack the Rogue raiding party but do not attack that Cavalier!&quot;  He keyed his comm back to the convoy channel.  &quot;Al, break off your attack and give yourself some distance between the Defenders before you reengage.  I've told them to hold off, but I'm not taking any chances with you.&quot;
<br />&quot;Understood.&quot;  Grey's Cavalier immediately turned about and sped towards a farther target above the remaining transports.
<br />&quot;Orbital convoy, this is Liberty Police Blue 1-1.  Keep firing your turrets!  Engage cruise engines as soon as you can!&quot;  The Armored Transports complied, sending pulses of energy out from various points on the hull.  The raiders had gotten a bit more selective though as they now began to target individual turrets on the transports, or attempted to blow open the underside cargo hatches and tractor in whatever loot might have come out.  Fortunately, the transports had enough clear time to enable six more of the ten remaining to engage their cruise engines and streak away from the foray.</div>

<br />While the battle was raging, Kiron managed to slip away. He hoped that the rogues didnt decide to come after him and his food rations. He made his way to Freeport 4, the price for food there was still good enough. 15K from freeport 4, good he thought to himself, seems nobody noticed me yet</div>

<br />Rich knew all he had to do was stay alive for 30 more seconds. Just as he took down a blood hound he past near the surviving escorts, he was quite suprised to find they were a bretoinian and liberty police working together well recently the universes had been full of suprises.
<br />
<br />As rich considered an identaty check on the BPA officer when he was hit buy missles, from a liberty defender!. Not good he thought, if the battle group came through and found liberty heavy fighters then this war would escalate very fast indeed.
<br />
<br />Just as this thought appered in his head, the battle ship 'yorkshire' ,five gunboats
<br />and seven squads of cavalers exited the cortez jump hole and began firing into the melstrom.
<br />Rich open comm with the LPI patriot

			<div class="content">ANNOUNCEMENT. THE NEXT PERSON TO JOIN MUST BE A BRETONIAN, WERE NOT GETTING ENOUGH. (sorry for caps, but its important)
<br />
<br />Leon/Wolfhound <i>Katana </i>/Magellan/Outcast
<br />
<br />What the heck! One of his Daggers was now transmitting a BAF signal! It had shot his Rhinos!
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn. Your mine.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Rouges, destroy the Transports, we'll tractor in the loot.&quot;
<br />
<br />Leon didn'd want to kill inoccents unnecesarily, but if he didn't have any Rhinos, he was gonna have to.
<br />
<br />He turned to face the Dagger. It seemed to be fleeing, probably as it was outnumbered twenty to one. Leon opened up with the <i>Katana's </i> lasers and missile launcher, relentlessly attacking.
<br />
<br />The Dagger knew he couldn't win. Engaing his Cruise Engines, he turned around, heading for the Cortez Jump hole. Leon tried to fire a Cruise Disruptor, only to get a warning tone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Beep! Out of ammunition.&quot; Said his computer calmly. Behind him, one of the Armoured Transports exploded. Leon hit his tractor beam button and tractored in the loot. Diamonds!.
<br />
<br />6 of the Ships got away, leaving the four more damaged ones left.
<br />
<br />&quot;Rouges! Aim for the cargo bay doors.&quot;
<br />
<br />One by one, the cargo doors exploded, allowing more loot out. Leon tractored it in until his cargo bay was full. Turning round, he sped away for Mactan. he didn't know what was coming next..</div>

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Magellan System/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />Edwards cursed as he saw the Bretonian task force come through the Cortez Jump Hole, along with the fact that one of the transports was in fact destroyed.  Still, the Rogues were getting a little more careful with their shots.  Rather than trying to blast the transports to smithereens, they were now only aiming for their cargo doors, tractoring in the loot that spilled out.  Now, the three remaining transports broken and empty, the remaining Rogues.... and one Outcast, Edwards noticed, began to turn tail, speeding off towards the direction of Mactan Base.
<br />
<br />There wasn't much more left to do now.  Edwards was mildly satisfied at the fact that sixteen of the twenty transports escaped, cargo... and especially passengers intact.  He was irked that the Rogues were careless enough to blow up one of the transports, but then again, he wasn't all too surprised.
<br />
<br />The thought was fleeting though as he saw the Liberty Navy Defenders open fire once again, this time on the Dagger with the Bretonia Armed Forces ID tag.  <i>Idiots! </i> he thought.  He keyed his comm.  &quot;Al, I'm bugging out of here.  Go back with the task force.  Good work today.  I'll keep in touch.&quot;
<br />
<br />He didn't bother to wait for Grey to reply as he switched to the Liberty frequency again.  &quot;Liberty Defenders, this is Liberty Police Blue 1-1!  Disengage your attack at once!  The BAF and BPA forces will watch the rest of the convoy.  Come about and alter course for Freeport 4!  NOW!&quot;</div>
