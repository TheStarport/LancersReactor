			<div class="content">I was there, I saw it.  The nomads.  They destroyed planet Carina.  I'm an outcast, well, a freelancer that works for the outcasts.  Name's Eric.  I fly a sabre with CERBERUS, DIAMONDBACKS, and 2 Pyros Type 3.  I was flying with a couple of my Outcast buddies, hunting the hunters. when we saw it. I have always marvelled at Carina, being born on Malta.  My parents were on the team who discovered the Carinian poison.  We flew into the clearing, and we saw them.  I'd seen things about the Nomads, but none did them justice.  what we saw will remain burned into our minds for the rest of our lives.  Unfortunately that wasn't lond for 2 of us.  There was a massive Blue net around the planet.  it began to shrink untill it was shrink-wrapped around the planet. it began to glow brightly, so brightly we couldn't bear to look at it. when the glow was gone, so was Carina.  The Planet was never settled, but there was a research team there, to try and replicate the poison for use against the Corsairs.  Immediately we began to flee the scene, engaging our cruise engines.  The Nomads cought up to us though, and disrupted our cruise.  we turned to fight.  I fired a couple shots at the forstship I saw, and it disintegrated. at the same time, 2 of my wingmen were also destroyed. There was only me and an outcast ace, we managed to destroy 2 of the ships, and cripple another, when My radar began to warn me of 3 incoming contacts.  They registered as Hammerhead Class, but they diddn't register as hostile.  Bounty Hunters?  Helping outcasts? The hunter ships opened fire on the last nomad, and it was easily destroyed.  I immediately radioed the leader of the Hunters.
<br />ERIC: &quot;This is Freelancer Gamma 6 - 16 to unknown ships. Please identify yourselves, Over.&quot;
<br />UNKNOWN SHIPS: &quot;This is Order Alpha 3-1. we're on a Patrol from the Osiris. Over.
<br />ERIC:&quot;Order?! what's the Order doing in Omicron alpha? Over.&quot;
<br />ORDER ALPHA 3 - 1: &quot;There's been increased Nomad activity in this system. Orillion sent us to investigate. Over&quot;
<br />ERIC: &quot;Investigate?! They blew up Planet Carina! and why are you flying Hammerheads? Over&quot;
<br />ORDER ALPHA 3 - 1: &quot;So thats what that massive energy signature was.  You'd better come with us back to the Osiris so you can tell Doctor Quintaine about ewhat you saw, and we're flying these hammerheads because they provide a cover identity to anyone who sees us. The Anubis can be intimidating. Over&quot;
<br />ERIC: &quot;To the Osiris? We have to get back to Malta For repairs. Over&quot;
<br />ORDER ALPHA 3 - 1: &quot;Then you're in luck. The Osiris is Cloaked over Planet Malta. Let's go. Over&quot;
<br />We engaged our cruise engines and set our course. For malta what we saw there was much worse that what we saw at Carina...
