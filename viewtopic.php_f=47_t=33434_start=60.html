<br />
<br />If only the hackers had listened, then like the rouges at montezuma and there allies at alcatraz they would still be alive and helping them but when the battle ship turned up and they ignored the comms they had no choice. The only good thing that had come about from this was he got his crusader back
<br />
<br />The admiral had explaained the plan to him twice now and he still didn't like it, the rouges, equiped with advanced wepons, would attack the liberty blockade at the cortez gate aided by a bretoinian batlle group. Hopfully the blockade at the megellan gate would sent some ships to help. This depleted blokade would then be hit by three more battle groups, including the 'Yorkshire's group. All this mayhem would start in one hour.

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/San Diego Border Station/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />This was a mess.  A royal mess.
<br />
<br />After managing to get the Liberty Navy Defenders to break off and follow him away from the battle, he'd ordered them to the California Jump Gate.  Needless to say, the flight leader wasn't all that pleased Edwards had ordered him away from such a &quot;target-rich&quot; environment.  But Edwards wasn't in the mood for any of the pilot's macho flyboy crap.  After giving the threat that his actions might've just finished ensuring a potential war between Liberty and Bretonia, he noticed the Defender pilots more eagerly turned eastward towards the California Jump Gate.  Whether it was becasue they were eager for battle or fearful that the entire Magellan System would try to smite them he couldn't tell.  Either way they were out of his hair.
<br />
<br />After passing by Freeport 4, and hailing the station's commander to check on the progress of the Curacao evacuees, he docked his Patriot into the Trade Lane to the California Jump Gate and waited.  On the way, his comm flared to life.  It was a prerecorded transmission... from Chief Constable Alistair Grey.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nate!  I can't talk long.  I'm running this through an encrypted channel over Freeport 4's comm network from the <i>Yorkshire </i>.  Listen to me... I found out the battle plan!  Our fleet is supposed to team up with several groups of Liberty Rogue fighters in both Magellan and Cortez!  The BAF admiral on the <i>Yorkshire </i> told us all, as he marshalled as many BAF and BPA forces as he could in Manchester, New London, and Leeds.  I'm trying to countermand his orders and keep all the Cavalier squadrons out of the fight, but the pilots aren't all that willing to listen.  I promise I'll keep trying.  Get as many defenses as you can to the California System!  Get those gates shut down!  Keep them on this side!  Do whatever you can to keep our forces out of Liberty!&quot;
<br />
<br />Edwards had sat there in frozen shock for a moment at the information he'd just received.  How soon until the attack?  How many ships?  So many unanswered questions.
<br />
<br />He pushed the memories out of his mind as he approached the lieutenant in charge of San Diego Border Station in the Operations Center of the outpost.
<br />&quot;Lieutenant, I'm taking command here.&quot;  Not waiting for the young lieutenant to reply, knowing the subordinate wouldn't question his decision, he made his way to the comms officer.  &quot;Get me Governor Farrell!&quot;  Minutes later, California System Governor Jameson Farrell's image was playing across the central viewscreen, the backdrop of Los Angeles City adding atmosphere to the governor's image.
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain Edwards, I hope this is important.&quot;
<br />&quot;Governor, it is imperative that you move as many forces as possible to the Cortez and Magellan Jump Gates.  The entire system must be put on red alert.&quot;
<br />Farrell seemed unimpressed.  &quot;Captain, I'm well aware that the Bretonian Armed Forces are massing a fleet in the Cortez System.  What makes you think they're about to be bold enough to move against us?&quot;
<br />&quot;Sir, I have a very reliable source within the Bretonia Police Authority-&quot;
<br />&quot;The police!?&quot;  Farrell reacted as if Edwards had said the dumbest thing to be heard in all the universe.  &quot;The Bretonia Police Authority is the lapdog of the Bretonian Armed Forces.  What makes you think he can be trusted?&quot;
<br />&quot;Governor, he's a high-ranking officer within the BPA.  What's more, he's with a BAF task force that just entered the Magellan System at least 30 ships strong.  Now that's not as strong as the force mounting in Cortez, but they're going to have help as they punch through the Magellan line.  My source said that the BAF has brokered a deal with a large group of Liberty Rogues and are going to be coming through the Magellan Jump Gate soon.&quot;
<br />&quot;How soon?&quot; Farrell asked, now appearing to think about Edwards' report.
<br />&quot;I don't know, sir.  Hours, one hour, maybe less.  I didn't receive that information.  Sir, I would not be contacting you if I thought that our current blockading forces could handle the attack.  We need more reinforcements at the gates.  I suggest pulling more Navy forces from the New York System and getting them here as fast as we can.&quot;
<br />Governor Farrell seemed to sigh at this.  &quot;All right, Captain.  I hoped I wouldn't be getting a report like this, but I know you're not the type to blow things out of proportion.  I'll place the system on alert and request more Navy forces from Admiral Baldwin on Manhattan.  In the meantime, I'm putting you in charge of an operation.  If we're going to surely keep the Bretonians on their side, we have to shut down the gates from their side.  Closing our gates down would only keep ships from entering Magellan or Cortez.  We need to render the gates in those systems useless.  I'm ordering a Navy detatchment of Defenders to go through the Cortez Gate.  They'll shut down the California Gate on the other side with the emergency seizing codes.  I'm transmitting a copy of those codes to your Neural Net directory.  When you get to Magellan, use those codes to shut down the jump gate.  Your best bet is to put the command on a time-delay, giving yourself time to get out of Magellan.&quot;
<br />Edwards nodded.  &quot;Understood, sir.&quot;
<br />&quot;Good luck, Captain.  Farrell out.&quot;  The screen went blank and Edwards turned to the lieutenant previously in command.  &quot;Take us to Red Alert and arm all defenses.  Advise all Navy and Police units in the area to rally at San Diego or the Cortez Jump Gate post haste.&quot;
<br />The lieutenant nodded and turned to work.  Edwards turned and headed down to the hangar bay, once again restarting his Patriot.  This day was not done yet.</div>

			<div class="content">Santiago Alcaren/Legionaire/Corsairs/Trafalger Base (sry, not good with spanish last names)
<br />
<br />Santiago was bored. Bored stiff. Nothing really happening, It had been a while since anything had happened, and no news had come about news at crete and cadiz besides the usual Corsair-Red Hessian Squabbles. He sighed and picked up his sidewinder fang. A junker approached him. &quot;What do you want?&quot; Santiago said, taking a gulp of his beer. &quot;You are wanted.&quot; Santiago nearly spat out his beer on the junker. Him wanted? He wasn't important, he hadn't done anything. Why him? He got up. &quot;Where is he?&quot; &quot;Follow me.&quot; Santiago was lead to the ship bay. Nearby he could see his legoinaire. Nearer was a corsair that he knew. He wasn't exactly friendly with him though. Santiago went up to him. &quot;Long time no see, Pedro.&quot; &quot;As if I wouldn't come back to imform you that there was an assignment for you. You are to go recon in the Independent Worlds, specifically Magellan System. There have been strange things going on. While you stay here and get drunk, your fellow pilots have noticed strange things going on in bretonia. War is stirring in the colonies. If the colonies are fighting each other, we will be able to take advantage of thier weakness.
<br />
<br />Mission: Recon the Magellan system and find out what's going on.
<br />Reward: Loot for everyone and all the transports you can destroy.
<br />
<br />[Accept [Decline
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, if it comes to that, I think that I'll like this.&quot; &quot;Good, you will be Red 3 of the Reconaissance group. Now get  your hide out there.&quot; Santiago went toward his ship. He jumped inside and launched to space.

<br />&quot; So that was what the battle was all about&quot; Said a Spa and Cruise guy. Kiron had noticed a high amount of traffic and wanted to know what happened. Now he was in the bar of Freeport 4, taking to an agent of spa and cruise. So, it was that same guy who warned me, kiron muttered under his breath, well its none of my business. Hmmm, with increased piracy in these areas, Maybe i need to better equiq the ship.

<br />Kiron looked at his empty glass. &quot; Bah! I just stay here for a while and think of the next trade route, batender, give me another glass!&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />@ GDIOfficer: No, I suppose he legally couldn't order your character around, especially considering he's only police and your character's in the Navy.  But the situation was desperate.  And dude... can you please write your posts in complete sentences with capitalization?  I'm not trying to harp on ya... but it's getting harder to decipher your writings.
<br />
<br />IC:
<br />It must've been fate for the LPI captain.  No sooner after his Patriot sped out of San Diego's hangar bay for the Magellan Jump Gate, the onslaught had begun.  The Bretonians were already coming through.  Thankfully, the gunners on the battleships and cruisers weren't asleep at their controls and opened up on the first wave of Crusaders that came through.  They didn't last very long.  But then they kept coming and coming, wave after wave after wave.  Edwards knew they would keep coming unless he got to Magellan and shut down the jump gate on that side.  Frustratedly, he engaged his cruise engines and opened a system-wide channel.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Captain Nathan Edwards, Liberty Police Blue 1-1.  We have confirmed Bretonian attack forces entering California at the Magellan Jump Gate.  Any and all Liberty forces not previously assigned, report to the Magellan Jump Gate at once.&quot;  Speeding through the maelstrom of Liberty and Bretonian fighters, as well as the turret fire from the capital ships, he streaked towards the Magellan Jump Gate, using the codes given to him by the governor and activating the gate.  Nervously, he sped into the gate, hoping this wasn't as much of a suicide mission as it looked to be.  He hoped the Defenders in Cortez would have better luck.</div>

<br />Ran into the large movement off spa and cruise by the base... strange... a lot off them, maybe to much... some off the escorts turned around to intercept me... i accepted the fight by the base... but the auto turrets started also to shoot at me... &quot;i'm hostile with them, i must fight and stay fighting here&quot;...
<br />
<br />i'm hunting some off the escorts but their where to much off them, also destroyed a few transporters, but also to much where firering at me... my wing got shot off... now i have just only 2 hull guns... it is a fight i couldn't win, co'z to much, way to much activity off hostile around... i saw that more actiity came on the scanners... i scrolled ot down and a group off bounty hunters piranha where coming...
<br />
<br />i though; &quot;i will die out here, their is no way out... just kill as much i can kill...&quot;
<br />while the lights and bleeps stay on... &quot;shield down&quot; and &quot;incoming missile&quot; where also normaly... i heard also a few times hull cracking apart from my ship...
<br />this is the end... to much activity... to much enemy activity...
<br />
<br />&quot;powercore overheated&quot; light bleeps on... first in yellow... i stay shooting, then it turned slowly more into red... &quot;powercore melting warning&quot;.. the ship interior was lighten up by the red warning light off the powercore, the lwo hull and the much activity bleeps and lights around...
<br />
<br />after a split second their was a large light and a big boom from the back off the ship... the computer warned &quot;powercore exploding&quot;... i heated it to much up in the figh... it worked to hard and had not much cooling around it... the savety pod (escape pod) was launched by this with a large force from the explosion...</div>
