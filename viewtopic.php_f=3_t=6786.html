			<div class="content">Hello and welcome to the Freelancer forum! We are very pleased you stopped by to make a post here! But there are some rules you have to take in mind before doing so.
<br />
<br />Let me put them in no particular order.
<br />
<br />
<br />-	First make sure you&#8217;re posting your question/comment in the right forum. Click here to see all the forums: <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/' Target=_Blank>Click here</a>.
<br />-	Please read the <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/faq.asp' Target=_Blank> Rules and Regs first.</a> Some basic rules about the forums can be found there. This is the <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/faq/default.asp?game=Freelancer' Target=_Blank> FAQ link</a> for questions about the games Starlancer and Freelancer.  We do frown on <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=31862&amp;forum_id=3&amp;Topic_Title=Spoilers+in+this+forum+are+NOT+allowed%21%21&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Discussion&amp;M=False&amp;S=False' Target=_Blank> spoilers on the game itself </a> in this forum.  We have a place for those <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/forum.asp?forum_id=16&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;cat_title=Freelancer' Target=_Blank> right here </a> Fire away but 99.99999% of the spoilers have been identified by now.  
<br />
<br />Also, as a site we have decide there is a taboo of discussion on any forum.  Read about them by clicking on the word about <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=6265&amp;forum_id=3&amp;Topic_Title=MUST+READ%3A+Concerning+Joystick+Discussions+on+these+Forums%21&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Discussion&amp;M=False&amp;S=False' Target=_Blank> JOYSTICKS?  </a> and <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=30455&amp;forum_id=18&amp;Topic_Title=Concerning+cloaks%21&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+General+Editing+Forum&amp;M=False&amp;S=False' Target=_Blank> the dreaded <b> cloaking     </b> mod!! </a>
<br />Oh yea, and if you want to chat it up about the potential of Freelancer 2, this <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=30820&amp;forum_id=3&amp;Topic_Title=Ideas+for+Freelancer+2&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Discussion&amp;cat_title=Freelancer&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank> click right here </a> and read/reply to your hearts content.  
<br />
<br />Now if Fan fiction writing is in your blood and you want to submit your literary works, then just <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/staff/' Target=_Blank> click right here </a> and submit it directly to Eraser.  If you want to see the published works  of others, then simply click <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/features/fanfiction.asp' Target=_Blank> right here. </a>  There is the some good reading, worth the click.  Of course there is a special forum area we set aside for the writers located <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/forum.asp?forum_id=47&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Fan+Fiction&amp;cat_title=Freelancer' Target=_Blank> right here. </a>
<br />
<br />If you'd rather get a good laugh to begin your Lancers Reactor experience, <a href='http://www2.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=31808&amp;forum_id=3&amp;Topic_Title=You+know+you%27ve+been+playing+Freelancer+too+much+when%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Discussion&amp;M=False&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank> This link </a> is guaranteed to get you in the mood.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif  border=0 align=middle>  Feel free to add your own.
<br />
<br />Are there still questions you want to ask? Please read this first:
<br />
<br />-	Maybe your question already has been answered! You can do a forum search on the subject you want information on. It&#8217;s simple, just type in your subject, select the Freelancer Discussion and search! This feature can be found here: <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/search.asp' Target=_Blank>Forum search</a>. I'm sorry to say it but the search is removed due to the strain on the server. It's not sure if it's going to return.
<br />
<br />You still have a question or comment? Here&#8217;s some posting help.
<br />
<br />-	Please don&#8217;t put CAPITAL letters in your topic name. This could mean you&#8217;re screaming (netiquette) and above all, it looks not good. We&#8217;ll read your question/comment and if we can, we&#8217;ll post a reply. Don&#8217;t worry.
<br />-	Is your question a technical one, please give us your system specs (CPU, RAM, mobo and videocard). If you get an error, please give us the full error (when possible).
<br />-	We don&#8217;t like it when you&#8217;re bashing someone, for instance things like: &#8220;I hate the game for the static trading prices!&#8221; Your voice can&#8217;t change anything anymore. Your only hope is to pray for add-ons/patches.
<br />-	If you want to give your opinion on the game, please look for another topic with the same subject. It is very annoying to see 5 topics with the same subject. If you give your opinion and it&#8217;s a bad one, please give arguments why you don&#8217;t like it.
<br />-	Topics with the subject &#8220;Joystick&#8221; support are not appreciated. All the things have been said about this subject. Please do a forum search on this issue.
<br />
<br />Well, this is it. Now you&#8217;re off to post your topic here on TLR. The large amount of users are willing to help you! I hope you&#8217;ll like Freelancer and maybe you can drop by in our IRC chatroom: <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/chat/' Target=_Blank> IRC chat</a>
<br />
<br />Have fun!
<br />
<br />Vincent &quot;Wizard&quot; Hoogeboom

<br />Real quick, here's a few more quick information threads:

<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Topics of dubious virtue   </b> (likely to be clicked!) 
<br />
<br /><b>Freelancer 2   </b> and all ideas related to Freelancer 2 and its possibly making, including but not limited to: Threads pertaining expansion packs, sequels, what is missing from the game, grumbles and more. These threads have been started so many times that it has come to the point where nothing new is added. Please see the stickied thread regarding ideas for Freelancer 2 - which is dedicated to discussing FL2 possibilities and ideas as to what it should contain. Use this for anything regarding any of the aforementioned topics!
<br />
<br /><b>Cloaks   </b> - which are a blanket ban on the talking upon. The cloak mod is not available, and not hosted here - so its not being with-held at all. We don't have it. Topics asking for it will be instantly locked/deleted without warning. There are harsher re-percussions for persistance in discovery/discussion of this topic.
<br />
<br /><b>Best ship threads   </b> - covered so many times that nothing new can be added. It is highly frowned upon, and likely to be instantly locked/deleted. If you wish to discuss best ships, i am affraid that you will have to search the threads and read others comments. Starting new threads will get locked/deleted, as will old threads!
<br />
<br /><b>Digging up old topics   </b>: there are no rules upon this front, however, please refrain from posting comments in older topics unless the content is something valid. Definately do NOT post in dead topics IF your post will consist of an agreement to an earlier point, a thankyou or a question pertaining somethign discussed. Search the forums for more information.
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>Posting images   </b>
<br />
<br /><b>Regarding Pictures on this, and other, forums   </b>
<br />
<br />Please follow these guidelines:
<br />
<br />1. once you have taken your screenshot - use PAINT (note - NOT photoshop) and resize it to around 800 x 600 and then SAVE it as a JPEG. This will make it around 50Kb per screenshot. USE paint, or if you HAVE to use photoshop - use a POOR quality setting, YOU CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE FOR THIS IDEA, as this will keep them SMALL in size (around 50kb instead of 200kb).
<br />
<br />2. Once you have saved it, now RESIZE the picture AGAIN to around 250x175 or so. Then SAVE THIS AS A JPEG FILE AND CALL IT THUMB!!!!!
<br />
<br />So then you have two files:
<br />1. Desktop.jpg
<br />2. Thumb.jpg
<br />
<br />Now - use some nice coding from the forums to create the IMAGE of the thumb on the forum which is an ACTIVE LINK to the picture size. This will ensure that loading this thread will take seconds, EVEN for a 56k modem user. So they see a small version (only 16kb or so) and click if they want to see more. Then they can see the full sized version (which can be any size you like) in a new window.
<br />
<br />See my example below
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/29.JPG' Target=_Blank><img src='http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/29thumb.jpg  '></a>
<br />
<br />The code for this is (*subsitute square brackets instead of the curly ones)
<br />{url=http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/29.JPG}{img=http://www.pathfinderstudios.com/PICTURES/29thumb.jpg}{/url}
<br />
<br />There we go, obviously change the links to YOUR host of pictures <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />The image above is only about 100x75 - so yours will be alot bigger of course - which is nice to <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. In effect you could do this in a thread containing one picture or around 300 x 225 or so - which is linked to the full size version <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />Thank you, and enjoy posting/discussing things on Lancers Reactor!
