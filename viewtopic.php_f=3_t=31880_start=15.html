			<div class="content">Eh, Outcasts dont have the firepower to stop Liberty, Reinland, Britonia and Kasaris Navy and there elite forces. 
<br />Sure they can make the civilians dependant on cardimane BUUUUUUUUTTT if the houses actually go ahead and try to give them cardimane, it wont be thorugh trading with the pirates! They would most likely take over the Outcasts areas where they get their cardimane and leave the Outcasts to die.
<br />
<br />But if you think about it.....Reinland is a cool place! When they got to the Sirius sector they were jammed into that corner with nebulas and crappy freezing planets (New Berlin). I think that people should actually SUPPORT Reinland and let them have a few planets in Liberty. And i think that all the houses should gang up on Liberty and take all their planets and share them out. Liberty doesnt help any other House and they are so weak they cont even get rid of the Rogues!
<br />I mean, Any other military could! In fact, why dont they offer amnesty to the pirates and let them trade artifacts cause they wont hurt anybody if they are legally allowed to deal with them.
<br />
<br />Any way, My clan is trying to bring the nation of Reinland together with Liberty!
<br />We are getting the systems in Liberty (except NY) and the systems in Northern Reinland (Stuttgard, Hamburg) and the systems inbetween them. 
<br />We dont like anybody who supports the Liberty goverment but we do not pirate or tax people! All pirates are welcome AND we have special missions for people to do like getting drugs and bringing em back to us oorrr delivering money to people. And the people who do these missions get a lot of money or guns (Codename guns or Nomads or Lvl 9 guns)
<br />
<br />So join our clan!

			<div class="content">Here's an idea, Liberty is weak so the new players dont get instantly blown against the wall by the first rogue that comes thier way. :p
<br />
<br />As for the Rhienland fleet reaching New Tokyo in the 80 years war, you've just confused two totally separate conflicts.  In the 80 years war, the GMG lured the Rhienland fleet into the Yanagi pocket, where they drew off the escorts into the clouds, and using thier knowlegde of the territory, repeatedly ambushed them.
<br />
<br />The think about Rhienland reaching New Tokyo, thats the war that happens in SP :p  totally different from al those wrecks.
<br />
<br />
<br />As for the Westfallen, its it the only capital ship remaining in the Rhienland Navy.  
<br />
<br />Out of the houses, its really a tos up between the Corsairs and Outcasts, maybe even the BH's, but i doubt it.  Personally, i give it to the outcasts, just because the Sabre is superior to the Titan.</div>

			<div class="content">If you will read the news items &amp; talk to the bar NPCs quite a lot of information is forthcoming concerning the history of Sirius &amp; Houses/Factions. The case regarding Rhineland goes to their war which basically eliminated their military then the strikes by the workers left them bankrupt.
<br />
<br />But in regrads to the question I would say Rhineland has the better house ships. For Hose fighters I prefer a Valkyire then the Dragon. IMMHWO these have the best armour &amp; bang-bang capability.

			<div class="content">Actually, every house but Kusari has some kind of resource problem or another...
<br />
<br />Liberty's strength lies in their capital ships, as I believe has been stated before. Their Cruisers carry the most powerful main weapon of any house ship, and their Battleships' two main guns tote around some nasty firepower as well. 
<br />
<br />They also have the benefit of having their largest ship production facility located in a system with only one entry/exit point- unlike other houses, they would have an easy time defending their facilities as it would only take a few ships blocking up the passage to put an end to any attacks. Not to mention that the attackers would have to get to the core of the house's territory before they could even hit said facilities...
<br />
<br />Liberty chooses fast, agile fighters to support powerful capital ships. Other houses use more powerful fighter based craft and less powerful capital ships to support them. Keep in mind that thin as a Liberty fighter's hull may be, they can still carry the most powerful Torpedoes, Mines, and Cruise Disrupters, and still have some very effective weapon combinations for their low level.

			<div class="content">why would the outcasts need firepower ? like the other dude said just  get the addicted on card. and they dont have to make them there slaves just mass alll there ships around malta and keep everyone out (in other words) starve everyone to death  by not supplying them with  card. 
<br />
<br />so you see they dont need fire power just keep everyone out of omi. Alpha
<br />mines-/ only small formations of ships can enter a Jump hole at a time ;p and battle ships can only enter 1 at a time. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Oh ya a question, why dont other Jump hole's destablize  like the ones in Sp , dont you think they all would ? and then fase inline again ?</div>

			<div class="content">when looking at the other houses, you have to understand that the economies of the 3 outer houses are all resource based.  Bretonia is built on its minerals, including Gold, HydroCarbons and Berrylium.  Rhienland is also dependant on its minerals and resources, largely in the Walker nebula.  Kusari is completely built on HydroCarbons and H-Fuel.
<br />
<br />Liberty on the other hand, is not.  Liberty has only one direct extraction point, which is Planet Pittsbugh.  Liberty produces conusmer goods whihc require non-rare components.  The main source of income comes from the manufacture, shipping, construction, maintanence, and fees from all the trade lanes. &quot;The Big Three&quot; are all built around the tradelanes.
<br />
<br />Ageira produces the part, Universal ships the parts, along with other high risk cargos, and IC insures cargo, aka the stuff moving through the tradelanes.
<br />
<br />DSE, which is not of the Big Three, draws its funds from construction and maintenence of Trade lanes.  My point?  Liberty does not need to expand for resources, like the other houses.  Took a really long time to get there didnt it :p
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />As for jumpholes going in and out of phase, would you play FL if you had to wait 10 minutes for a jumphole to work?  I doubt it.</div>

			<div class="content">Just to get that straight: the game is built so that the difficulty level scales as the SP campaign advances.  It's a bit fake on the RPG part since the whole game does not increase in difficulty as you level up, you just get to visit new, thougher areas.  So that's why Liberty has the weaker ships, followed by Bretonia, Kusari and Rheinland.
<br />
<br />Now, the assesment is correct that Liberty does not survive on their natural ressources.  In fact they couldn't, as they only control 4 systems which are not particularly rich in any ressource.  However, Liberty houses the most corporations: Universal, Gateway, DSE, Interspace Commerce, Ageira, Cryer (?), Synth Foods, etc.  However, they do have their problems: the biggest being criminality.  1/4 of their systems (Texas), is exclusively populated with criminals, and they need 2 prisons to contain them (3 if you count the one in Alaska), the most of any other house (average of 1 prison per house).  Most prisonner who are released join the Rogues or Xenos.  The Liberty space crawls with criminal bases, and so do the independent worlds between houses.  In a sense, criminality is out of hand.  And let's not forget that after the Dallas incident, the Texas system has been rendered unsuitable for further development, which effectively leaves Liberty with 3 viable systems.  All in all, Liberty has a strong economy but a weak military.
<br />
<br />On to Bretonia.  They were the last to arrive in Sirus so they had to make up for the lost time.  The fact that they landed in an area on the other side of the Barrier put them appart from the criminality problems associated with the other systems, except for the Mollys and Gaians, the native criminals in their space.  They also had rich systems in minerals, which promoted companies like BMM and Bowex.  The Bretonian military is average.  However, their biggest problem in recent years has been the invasion by the Outcasts enroute to Liberty and the Corsairs from the Omega systems.  As the Corsairs say, the Bretonian military is not prepared to take them on.  However, Bretonia has access to the Tau and Omega systems, rich in minerals, thus ensuring their future prosperity.
<br />
<br />As for the Kusari, they are the most high tech of the 4 houses.  It's false they live only on H-Fuel.  That's mainly exploited by the GMG, a strongy independent faction.  However, the Samura and Kishiro are manufacturing hi-tech products, like optronics, optical ships, engine components, super alloys, etc.  In my mind, the Kusari have the strongest economy and do not really rely on the other houses, except for the minerals their systems lack.  But they have the capacity to build many ships and the ressources to do so.  Given time, they can mount a very impressive armada.  And the Dragon is a very effective HF.  Plus given that the GMG single handedly defeated the whole Rheinland fleet in the 80-years war, it gives an idea of what the Kusari can achieve.  I think they have a strong economy and a fairly strong military.
<br />
<br />Last is Rheinland.  Given their brilliant display in the SP campaign, I think they have the potential to field the best army of the Sirus space.  In any case, the Banshee and Valkyrie are finer ships than those produced by any of the other houses.  Plus, they were the only in the SP campaign to have fully mastered the cloaking devices allowing them to move undetected through all areas of Sirus and strike at the most opportune moment.  However, Rheinland is also broke after that 80-years war and the miner's strikes.  It cannot afford to pay its military or to build more ships.  In a sense, they don't pose a threat to the other houses at the moment.  But given a better economical context, I think Rheinland is the most impressive house in the game.  Even in though times they keep it together.</div>

			<div class="content">Rheinland strips itself of resources in SP. It has a huge navy, but no way to keep it supplied- I'd bet the vast majority of those ships were scrapped or abandoned once the leadership was no longer...&quot;influenced.&quot; They'll have to start new mining operations outside their teritory within a few years, or risk running out of raw materials altogether.
<br />
<br />The Kusari fleet was decimated late in SP. They are temporarily weakened, though they have no shortage of materials to rebuild with. They will be back on their feet in no time, as many of their capital ships obviously survived.
<br />
<br />Bretonia remained mostly untouched. They still have problems with their industry, as it produces massive quantities of waste. Leeds is the single most crapped up system in the whole sector. Since they fared the best out of the four houses during the SP game, they stand to gain the most from post-war reconstruction efforts.
<br />
<br />Liberty has a shortage only of materials to make H-Fuel- a look around Colorado shows massive quantities of untouched metals in several asteroid fields. They have a stranglehold on commerce, since their corporations are the only ones with the technology to build jump gates and tradelanes. Although Liberty took some losses in SP(most notably the three battleships which are destroyed- the others are not mission-critical kills, therefore they may or may not have been lost). They also gained technology- they are the only house seen to be using said technology during the SP game. Within a few years, their weapons may  be far more advanced than anything in the other houses.
