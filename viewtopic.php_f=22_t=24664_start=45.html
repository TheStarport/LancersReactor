<br />Not.
<br />
<br />Seriously, I am really unhappy to see this server going down. I'm not angry at the admins, rather I'm grateful that they put so much work into such a great server, which was really the main one that I played on. I'll miss Elite. See you around, guys.

			<div class="content">Sorry guys but Elite had a offer to have there files taken up by a server that plans to stay up tell no one plays FL anymore. I emailed them and offered to take all of there files to my server and they did not even have the curtosy to responed to my email. Server is with in 60 pings of there server which means that it would have been a good choice and was a non moded server like Elite. This was over two weeks ago that I emailed them. Since that time I have put up a webpage and soon to have a forum and have started to play victors 1.62 mod. I have since gone to that mod on my server but it just makes the game more fun. I run a 2.53 gig cpu and two 512 DDR and DSL with over 1 gig upstream and downstream and 28 player online at once, never had a lag problem from anyone except people on 56 k modems, that was there side.  
<br />
<br />P.S. I will still take there files and run a server for those files.tell no one wants to play anymore. All they have to do is send me there MP accounts and that is not much to ask or hard to do even if they have 10000 accounts.

			<div class="content">Wow ... I take a break from Freelancer for a few months for (Ghost Recon) I come back and the number 1 rated server anounces it's going off line ... Disapointing but not the end of the world ...  Thanks for puttin up a Great server  and i hope yer still gonna at least be playing ... I think i'm gonna play a little single player for a while ... I've still got some stuff too accomplish. I'm sure the fan base is big enough that you'll see servers come and go alot ... but the communities will rebuild elswhere  ( 90% of the fun is building ) 
<br />
<br />Too the people with less than desirable things to say about the Elite admins, you should be ashamed for your comments. They have given us a free, stable, and fun server to play on and have set a great example for alot of potential admins to follow... Bravo ...

<br />I wish I had a nickel for as many conversation I've had with people that seem to go down this same road.  I try to be nice, I try to ask questions, I try to be polite and this is how it ends up.  Being a server admin for Freelancer is not worth it some days.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  BTW, this person was banned firstly for the obvious reason someone (maybe his brother, maybe not) cheating on that account and secondly for being such a pain in the butt to converse with.  Again, this is typical of the effort that was put forth time and time again on Elite to attempt to resolve a problem.

<br />Maybe some day I'll publish a book of &quot;the best of&quot; conversations I've extracted from monitoring the comms while admining Elite.  It could be very entertaining.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />My initial comments were heated, but they came from the heart and I&#8217;m certainly not going to apologize for them.  I don&#8217;t have any problem with you guys not wanting to run the server anymore. Bandwidth costs, hardware costs, etc. I can totally understand that and you deserve applause for running it as long as you did.  My beef rests only with the decision to not hand the files over to someone else and preserve the characters.  There is certainly no shortage of takers. What possible reasons could you have had that lead you to believe that keeping the files would be better than handing them off to someone else?  That&#8217;s really the million dollar question here. With such a win-win option available, I and many others remain confused as to why our characters are still doomed to oblivion.
<br />
<br />On the bright side, I&#8217;ve made a lot of new friends on other servers that I would never have met if I had stayed on elite. Still sad though, to see it go needlessly.</div>

<br />Simple, do a search on this very website of the servers that have just disappeared without any warning.  See how upset people do get when that happens.  Now giving 2 months notice of Elite going bye bye doesn't seem to be that bad anymore.  Also, think outside the box for a minute, since our announcement, the server has not had much of a reduction in participants, but certainly an enormous amount of NEW people who get a chance of playing on a clean, lag free mod free, cheat free server without much fear of being relentlessly hunted down by clans.  (remember how upset people were with the NEO clan around?  Do a search on that too!)  Sure, the peeps that have been playing since March might share that &quot;waste of time&quot; mentality granted, but the numbers of new players <b> prove  </b> people come to Elite to meet new people, fly in-game lag free, play the game as it was designed (puriest attitude for sure and has always been our goal) and couldn't give a rats behind what clan they find themselves on their KOS list.  2 months notice did exactly what we thought it would do, clean out the server and give some new players have a chance to spread their wings.  Mission accomplished

<br />Fair enough.  Considering there's been so many new players enjoy the server since the announcement...I just do not see near as many people complaining as they did when we were running our butts off trying to keep the idiots off the server that blatently break the server rules.  The time (mostly) and money (not too much) that was invested in being one of the community leaders of the big MP servers...hours upon hours of time staying ahead of the cheaters/modders/hackers with inventive, originally coded server tools.  You have no idea, none whatsoever.  
<br />
<br />Here's my opinion, until you invest the same amount of effort we did, your opinion is just another completely misinformed one at that.  Our decision to retire the characters was reached with some serious discussion.  Keep this in mind, and this will probably cut like a knife, but every server and it's contents (accounts) are always the property of the owner of said servers, no one elses.  For the record, we've had people ask to re-host, but none seems to have close to the server capacity to do much good.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Our experience of large numbers of total accounts does in fact have a detrimental impact on the stability of the server.  We've purged litereally thousands of accounts this summer just to keep things running smooth.  Regardless of what your hardware is, transferring this amount of accounts to any server out there with existing accounts would bring them all to their knees.  If you don't believe the facts, I can't help.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  approximately 4 - 5 thousand accounts purged that were inactive up until the end of June and 6000+ accounts created since then.  Those numbers speak for themselves.
<br />
<br />Again, 2 months notice certainly upset some people, but the numbers indicate many more have enjoyed the server since the announcement.</div>

			<div class="content">Hello everyone. I've only recently become familiar with the closing of the Elite server. I do agree with most when they say this is rather upsetting news. I am, however, very grateful for the amount of time that I was able to participate on this very enjoyable server. It will be hard to start fresh . I think, though, that it will be a good thing, new begingings usually tend to be. Again, I'd like to thank the owners of the Elite server. It was truely a wonderful gaming experience.</div>

			<div class="content">People shouldn't criticize server admins for problems that were built in to the game by the developers. This game was designed with the user files saved on the server side. This game should have been designed as a massively multiplayer universe. It wasn't.
<br />
<br />Enjoy it for what it is. Criticize the people truly responsible. That way, when they get around to Freelancer 2, it will be the game we all wished Freelancer 1 was.
<br />
<br />And grow the heck up. I've never seen a more immature community of players in my life. Many of you bicker and argue and insult like you're about to enter fourth grade.
<br />
<br />Just be thankful for the good times you've had with Freelancer and the servers that are available. Although my interest in the game has finally dried up, I'm still thankful for the great servers I had the privilage to play on.
<br />
<br />And send your feedback to Microsoft and Digital Anvil and help them to realize the game's full potential the next time around. Tell them your concerns, your frustrations, and your hopes for future games.
<br />
<br />The old saying goes: If you're not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.
<br />
<br />Thanks Elite server admins for running a good server. Although my time on it was very limited, you deserve all the thanks for providing a free service to the community.
