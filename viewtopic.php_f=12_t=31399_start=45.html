			<div class="content">Well it really wasn't a lot, contrary to someone else's intimations but I like it better as removed (the one time) anyway.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Here's some more:
<br />
<br />CONTINUATION:
<br />
<br />Esquilax returned to the Ark lounge to find three more reviewing the newest recorded discussions that had taken place.  &quot;Who is that one?  Do you recognize him?  I think he's a n00b like Eskie said.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The registration profile data just says his name is Overlord.  He didn't fill in anything else.  Not even contact data.&quot;  Said the second.  
<br />
<br />&quot;So what, this is a free and open site.&quot;  Said the third. &quot;Besides, nothing is definite and we ARE talking about Wolfy.  It's like what Taw said.  How is he going to get there?&quot;  At that all three laughed.  &quot;There's Esquilax.  Let's ask him.&quot;
<br />
<br />Esquilax settled back onto his favorite chaise in this lounge and said his hellos.  Gathered in front of him were ~Corsair001, viator and pSYCHO.  ~Corsair spoke first.  &quot;Who is that Overlord?  I say he's a n00b, am I right?  I was just telling the others he had to be a n00b, pretty obvious, really.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Esquilax nodded in confirmation and had thought to keep his mouth shut but decided to check.  &quot;And you vi, have you ever seen this one before?&quot;
<br />
<br />Viator frowned.  Shaking his head.  &quot;No.  I don't think so but by the looks of him, he's too easy to forget.  I wouldn't forget a name like that but I dunno.... No.  I don't recognize him.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I thought the name was familiar.  But it might be because we've watched the latest replay so many times now.  And I understand that you guys got concerned about Overlord.  I just don't see why.&quot;  pSYCHO shrugged the last words out and looked at Esquilax inquisitively.  &quot;There's something more going on here, am I right?  Oh hi, Jagged.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I was over at the Movies lounge all this time and I noticed you leave with Finalday and Taw and then just saw you come back.  Something's up isn't it?  I want to help.  You know my motto!&quot;
<br />
<br />Esquilax winced and the other three let out low moans.  Jagged ignored them and studied the latest minutes for the Ark lounge.  &quot;He doesn't seem very dangerous.  Why is everyone so concerned with him?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's keep to the subject, shall we?&quot;  Finalday settled down just then as did Sir Spectre and Tawakalna.  &quot;Is the Ark really in Axum?  And if it is, I repeat, shouldn't we notify Bargib?  He has a right to know.  Taw, I think you and Esq owe some explanations.&quot;  Tawakalna looked at Equilax who gave a small nod of his head.
<br />
<br />&quot;OK.  There really isn't all that much to tell.  The Ethiopians say they have the true Ark.  I happen to believe that they are right. It's locked up in a sanctuary in Axum.  It is guarded by a holy man.  No one is allowed to see or touch it except for its keeper.  It has been this way for possibly more than two thousand years according to them.  I've known about this for quite a while now.  It's information available for anyone interested enough to look.  Surely Bargib already knows this story.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The information I posted here is simply that,&quot; added Esquilax. &quot;information.  It is not an assertion of fact one way or the other.  I also thought to make it available so that Wolfy finally could embark on his mission.  He'd been stewing about with nothing to do for too long and you know what that means for the rest of us.&quot;  Grumbled agreement.  &quot;I didn't know until I found the news bit.  And, yes Final, I sent a copy to Bargib.  If he didn't know about it before, he's known now since this morning.  And before anyone asks, he hasn't gotten back to me.  Not that he would.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;OK.  Well that's that then.&quot;  Finalday stood up.  &quot;I'm going to circulate, you know, to look around a little.&quot;  He caught Sir Spectre's eye who nodded back and then departed.
<br />
<br />&quot;You've been pretty quiet sS.  You weren't here earlier.  Actually, you haven't been around the Omni very much lately.  What brings you?&quot; asked ~Corsair.
<br />
<br />&quot;I've been busy with work and other things.  Maybe I haven't been in the OT all that much but I've been around.&quot;  Spectre looked at Esquilax and Tawakalna and then spoke:  &quot;I think I'll head back outside.  I was on my way to the stalls to pick up the latest models from one of my favorite crafters when I ran into Taw and Final so I thought I'd catch up on things with them.  Doesn't seem all that much of a problem if you ask me.  I'll stay alert as usual.  I'm going to finish up my business at the stalls now.&quot;  With that, he left.
<br />
<br />Esquilax looked at Tawakalna.  &quot;So you believe it to be true?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The Ethiopians believe it to be true and they have the historical record to support it.  Don't know anyone else with all that.&quot;
<br />
<br />~Corsair cleared his throat.  &quot;Would either of you care to explain why Bargib might even care to know about this bit of old history?&quot;  viator, sPSYCHO and Jagged nodded their heads as well.
<br />
<br />Tawakalna smiled.  &quot;It's really a long story and I've not got all the bits to it.  Just understand that Bargib would want to know if it really is the true Ark because it would mean a lot ot him to be able to know for sure and to take a look if he could.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Taw, where's Wolfy?&quot;  Esquilax looked about to make sure he hadn't missed Wolf Demon's return.
<br />
<br />&quot;He's gone to the GEF to get his gear.  sS talked him into waiting a day or two before going but he wanted to get started on his equipment for the trip.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So he's going then?&quot;  viator asked.  &quot;Is this really that solid a lead.  No offense Taw but just because the Ethiopians say its real doesn't say much as far as I'm concerned.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Does he need help?  I might go with him.&quot;  Jagged's face already looked set on going.  &quot;You no my...&quot;
<br />
<br />Raising his hand to stop him, Esquilax said &quot;Yes.  We know, we know.  If it will make you happy, I'll say your motto for you:  'We go for victory!'&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's right.&quot;  Jagged smiled.  He liked to remind his friends of his motto.  Not only because it was so true to his spirit but also because not to say it would have
<br />contradicted the motto.  He knew that his friends would tease him about it but that did not deter him.  It was a good one.  One well worth repeating.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's what Wolfy is going to find out I'd say.  Like I said I believe the Ethiopians; I'm not telling everyone else to do the same.&quot;   Tawakalna turned to Esquilax.  &quot;Are you staying here?  I thought I'd check on some other discussions.&quot;
<br />
<br />Esquilax shook his head.  
<br />
<br />Overlord re-registered at the entrance to the Theater.  He decided to switch names to fit his appearance.  Remembering an encounter in another place, he decided on Jaegermeister and slowly walked over to the vicinity of the Ark lounge.  He saw the crowd in it, some new faces and Esquilax and Tawakalna.  He checked around.  He didn't see the goatee'd Spectre or Finalday.  He kept his distance though and pretended to consider joining a newly formed lounge supposedly setup to discuss life, the universe and everything.  It was then that he noticed how others would walk up to a lounge and pass their handhelds over the threshold and walk away or, in some cases, sit down and view the handheld.
<br />
<br />Overlord/Jaegermeister reached into his pocket and pulled up his handheld.  He hadn't thought to look at it since he'd landed.  Quickly, he found that he'd received two uploads of data which seemed to coincide with his original entrance and exit of the Ark lounge.  As he kept looking, a satisfied smile appeared on his face.  Looking around for an empty lounge, he walked over to sit in it.  As he did, he saw that he'd received another upload.  He ignored that one and sat down to view the Ark lounge minutes from the beginning..............
