			<div class="content">I feel this is necessary, because I haven't quite retained a calm topic in the past about why I don't give away the cloak mod. I will start off here with the only occasions it will work, and use that to explain why it is pretty much worthless anyway.
<br />
<br /><b>Cloaking only works in multiplayer </b>
<br />
<br />Yes, it does NOT work in single player, due to the technical reasons behind it that anyone who would understand it already knows it. The cloak simply just doesn't work in anything BUT an unmodded, unpatched server that you are NOT running, and someone else is. This also means it won't work in LAN, under most circumstances. 
<br />
<br />Yes, the patch can be bypassed, but that is EASILY noticable to an admin, when they see someone who is clearly acting strangely (Again, most of you who mod... you know what I mean...). That, and Freelancer Ioncross Server Thing totally catches cloaks, and I have tested my most advanced methods of bypassing, for experimental reasons, of course, and got nowhere past it.
<br />
<br />If the server is modded, then your modded files are not going to match what the game needs. So you will either crash, or it just won't cloak you. Simalerly, other methods other than the main one disallow you from actually decloaking. Untill we get ahold of the EXE, this can't be fixed.
<br />
<br /><b>If cloaking is released, almost everyone will get it. </b>
<br />
<br />This means that everyone will be able to see everyone cloaked. Thus, unless you are really so terrible that you can't fight the NPC's with even a friend or two, you may as well not cloak at all. Once again, it sucks, but that's just the way it worked out.
<br />
<br /><b>Cloaked npc's can shoot you anyway </b>
<br />
<br />I have come to this logical conclusion. Basically, they are just scripted NOT to shoot you, untill you get into their fire zone, at which point you always see them decloaking. This was simply there to add to the realism, and really can't be perfectly re-enacted through modding. I can come close enough to where firing the cloaker once will drain your energy for a LONG time, and to where firing it reveals your position hugely. That's easy to get around. Just fire your other guns. Therefor, that too is useless.
<br />
<br /><b>Cloaked players can shoot </b>
<br />
<br />They get full firepower when cloaks. :-
<br /><b>Cloaked players are not vulnerable to radiation, suns, or planets </b>
<br />
<br />My cloak slipspace combo is nice for a server admin, but against a player, well, even if you DID follow them into the sun, you would still be the one to fry. This is also counterable by resetting the cloak HP value, but a good part of the cheaters out there could undo this, too, and any other safeguard.
<br />
<br /><b>Cloaking can, on some servers, cause problems </b>
<br />
<br />Namingly, crash the server, crash the players games. I've only seen it happen on a constant basis on one server, but I have seen it sparadically elsewhere.
<br />
<br /><b>There is no honest way of telling you won't use it to cheat </b>
<br />
<br />Chances are, if you email me, you might never see me again, so I wouldn't have a clue if you were going to cheat or not. Basically, it's for the greater good that I not give it out, because if I did, somewhere someone will make the game a lot less enjoyable. 
<br />
<br />****
<br />
<br />You CAN email me if you have questions ABOUT the mod, but not asking FOR the mod. Just try and keep it in good grammar and spelling.
<br />
<br />As for why I made this topic, well, it wasn't really laid out well enough in the one already stickied. If stinger or Chips decides they don't want it, that's fine.</div>
