			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p21807" class="post-subject">America: Your Friendly Neighborhood Superhero</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Ah just wanna say that I truly appreciate and admire the generosity of this country. Indeed that America is the biggest donor country is not a myth or a tale. I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to say a few words of gratitude to the greatest darn country in the world, something you probably will not hear from the media obsessed with making the worse out of America.
<br />
<br />When my home country was embroiled in chaos and many Chinese were targeted in riots and massacred by the hundreds, this country opened its doors for us. They took us in as refugees and gave us nearly as much rights as any American. The government paid for my school, gave us working permit and gave our family a brand new start. Could I ask for more? Our neighboring countries, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, none of them were nearly as welcoming as the America. 
<br />
<br />When the Christians in Indonesia were being purged, village-by-village, America put pressure on the government to send in troops to protect them.
<br />
<br />Again when a number of atrocities (by that I mean atrocities as in mass murder and such) in East Timor became known, that involves a separatist group being massacred in cold blood, the American again puts so much pressure on the government to allow the people to vote to be part of Indonesia or to leave. In the end because of US intervention the government relinquished control of the bloodied region. Again none of the neighboring countries even cared enough for the plight of the persecuted to take real action.
<br />
<br />Then the country descended into an economic crisis. Much of it was due to the corruption that stemmed from tip to toe of societal classes. Now even at this time US intervened and loaned Indonesia a huge sum of money. Sadly many in the country knew little about gratitude and a lot of them have been indoctrinated to distrust the United States through their religion or school. They accused the United States of taking advantage of the situation and blamed her for enforcing very strict conditions on the huge loan. Yet now that her economy is mending it&#8217;s funny that no one ever accredited the United States, their help and tough measures for it.
<br />
<br />It&#8217;s unfortunate these days that despite of all these United States is often blamed for many things that were not its fault. There&#8217;s an irony at play here just like Spiderman. Spiderman runs around New York City saving lives, yet many distrusted him, often jumped to conclusion at his slightest mistake, accusing him as a criminal and such. Truly, more often than not, it&#8217;s a thankless job.  When he&#8217;s unable to help a soul or made a mistake, they would accuse him of failing or even causing the tragedy in the first place.
<br />
<br />The voice of the majority is often punctuated very loudly by the news media, but often they overlook the large minorities who felt that America&#8217;s actions had helped them in their worse crisis. 94% of Indonesians may not like American intervention and their parading and demonstrations in front of the embassy were often shown in the news. However there&#8217;re that 6% of 200 million people (which&#8217;s about 6 million btw) whose lives were saved in one way or another through America&#8217;s help. Our stories are rarely if ever heard on the news. Think about it. Pause a moment. How many people, the minorities like us must suffer, before it justifies help from fellow human beings. Think about the Kurds in Iraq who&#8217;re free from Saddams&#8217; persecution, the Christians in Indonesia, or Sudan and many more others. Truly our percentage might be small, but when you do the math, actually we&#8217;re not as small as you think. There&#8217;re millions of people like me who&#8217;re rarely heard, who&#8217;s very fond and grateful of America and all the ideologies that she stands for.
<br />
<br />In closing, I would like to say: way to go America! May God bless you year after year and keep you for His special purpose.
<br />
<br />Isn&#8217;t the following message inscribed to the Statue of Liberty beautiful?
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />&quot;Give me your tired, your poor, 
<br />Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

<br />I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&quot;
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Be proud America! You have a very special part in the world.</div>

			<div class="content">No offence.  But I think this counts as politics.  Which is against the rules here.  
<br />
<br />And as for the msg on Liberty, she was given by the French, whom the Americans don't particauly like at this point.  
<br />
<br />She is not an American Monument, she is a gift from France when the Americans rebeled against the English.

			<div class="content">The inscription on the base on which Statute of Liberty stands and was written by Emma Lazarus.  It was inscribed after it finally had been erected.  It was not original to the Statue. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />As RILMS said, the statue was a gift from the people of France.  In fact, the smaller test model of the statue stands in Paris on on an island in the Seine River. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />There was a delay in erecting the Statue.  In the beginning, people here did not know what to do about the Statue until land was set aside on Liberty Island to erect it.

			<div class="content">The New Colossus
<br />
<br />Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, 
<br />with conquering limbs astride from land to land; 
<br />Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand 
<br />a mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
<br />is the imprisoned lightning, and her name 
<br />Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand 
<br />Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command 
<br />The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame, 
<br />&quot;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!&quot; cries she 
<br />with silent lips. &quot;Give me your tired, your poor, 
<br />Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, 
<br />The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, 
<br />Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, 
<br />I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&quot; 
<br />
<br />I hope RILMS is correct and that political threads are off limits here in TLR, otherwise we'll end up with a mass of jingoistic threads that will ruin the experience.
<br />However, since this one is open I decided to post Emma Lazarus' full poem.
<br />I'd also like to respond to RILMS' unfortunate choice of words.
<br />&quot;the Americans&quot; do not nescessarily not like &quot;the French&quot;
<br />I personally like &quot;the French&quot; just fine. I may have some problems with the French governments political decisions, but that doesn't mean I don't like the people of France. (or any other people of any other nation for that matter)
<br />So please don't ascribe feelings of dislike to a whole people towards another people on account of political dissent.
<br />And, in case you think I'm a radical liberal American, I thought I should point out that I'm an active duty Army Cavalry Scout and a combat vet of Iraq and my politics are definitely conservative in nature.
<br />
<br />@ Visconti: I agree. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Edit: Almost forgot. She most definitely IS an American monument. The Statue was originally intended to celebrate the USA centennial. A monument is dedicated to serve as a remembrance.  Built and given as a gift by the people of France, remembering liberty achieved in America.
