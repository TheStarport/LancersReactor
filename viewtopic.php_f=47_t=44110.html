			<div class="content">I wish to write a piece of fan fiction for my english class.  I'm looking for some help bouncing around ideas for:
<br />Characters, plot flesh,  a standardized setting, and what fans would like to see.
<br />
<br />Here's what I've figured I'd do for the setting:
<br />1) Ships are expensive
<br />2) The Bounty Hunter's Guild has agents in every major settlement (30,000+), but only a few elite teams have craft.  The average BH gets where he's going using commercial ships and apprehends in person using small arms.
<br />3) Space conflicts are rare, but very serious affairs.
<br />4) The Sirius Sector is a widely varying place - Border systems are exceedingly seedy (pirates are NOT glorious)
<br />5) The established navies protect large interests, perform customs, patrol borders, and safeguard major trade lanes.
<br />6) The really dirty security work falls to professional mercenary groups such as the LSF (who have access to capitol ships).  They are the ones that go flying into nebulae to hunt down pirates after some action tees off whatever local gov. there is enough to order a strike.
<br />7) Liberty and Bretonia are tight-nit.
<br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> Kusari likes to be neutral and profit.
<br />9) Rhineland is more aggressive with its borders and doesn&#8217;t have mercy for pirates like the Hessians.
<br />10) Lucrative small scale space faring civilian ventures are smuggling, running supplies to deep space outposts, exploration (chancy like a gold rush), and galactic tours.
<br />11) Mining is only done by those huge semistation ships. (Large scale = profit)
<br />12) Capitol ships are larger.  Liberty battleship=frigate    Gunship=Patrol Boat
<br />13) Torpedoes, massed assaults, and nukes kill capitol ships. (B5 style)
<br />14) Most conflicts between nations involve a terraformable planet or two, MOX clouds, mining field rights, and the like.
<br />15) Kusari speak Japanese, Rhinelanders speak German, Libertarians and Bretonians speak English, and a few border locations have Spanish established.
<br />
<br />For the plot:
<br />1) There are two protagonists who begin on opposite sides of the law.  Shades of gray will bring them closer as far as legality goes.  The two will come from the same lower-middle class.
<br />2) To be clear: They never become buddies, maybe assocciates but rarely would their aims coincide.
<br />3) One is on the merc and bounty hunting side of the law.
<br />4) The other is on the freedom fighter/raider side.
<br />5) Both kick arse but go about it differently.
<br />6) One is more brutish with properly applied force (not stupid) and the other uses more cunning (both are equally cunning), uses people in a likable way, and strikes sparingly but lethally.
<br />7) One of the premises is that the readers end up rooting for one or the other and in the end only one wins.
<br />
<br />Your thoughts please.
<br />

			<div class="content">I have weird plot twist for you. Have you ever read book  Mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty? If you havent, it's about a captain [William Bligh. or christian fletcher.
<br />some say that Bligh was too harsh a captain, and so chrisian leads a bloody mutiny, dumping Bligh with the loyal crewmembers adrift in the ocean. So the question becomes, was Bligh do harsh? or was christian to rebbelious, sorta makes you wonder. so, what if, in a final battle, [this is only like an expamle!
<br />the two characters are locked in a knife cross. then, it ends!!!!! now, i no u probs wont do that, since i hate reading those type of books, its not that close with the Bounty, but just one of those thinkin books. i wil be happy to help u with what i can. of course i can only help so much before my great mind makes it cheating, lol, jk. its just a suggestion, but dont make it nothing but battle scenes and stuff, [well, chances are i shouldnt be talking, lol but make sure to have dialouge, character develpment, and some sort of struggle. i like ur basic idea tho, one prob with it. the thing with writing based from a Video game, is that its a limited audience, uull have to include some history, sorta like why were in sirius, that sorta thing. and most importantly
<br />
<br />
<br />HAVE FUN!!!!
<br />
<br />Edited out all those !!, don't do it again please <img src=smilies/icon_smile_disapprove.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">The &quot;!&quot; thing is fine,  the texts all extent PAGES to the right.  It only starts another line once someone presses &quot;Enter&quot;.
<br />  Example: Zeta 1 your message, the meat of it, is only three lines for some reason.  The actual text goes seven pages 
<br />to the right or at least my computer displays it as such.  Do I ask an admin what to do? Is there some sort of setting that lets
<br /> the text run on like that?  Example: I had to edit this paragraph w/&quot;Enter 3 times&quot; to keep the text on the screen.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you know what the chain of command is here? It's the chain I go get and beat you with to show you who's in ruttin' command.&quot; -Jayne Cobb
<br />&quot;Sure. It would be humiliating. Having to lie there while the better man refuses to spill your blood. Mercy is the mark of a great man. (lightly stabs Atherton with the sword) Guess I'm just a good man. (stabs him again) Well, I'm all right.&quot; -Malcom Reynolds

<br />
<br />Copied that off FL Datastorm
<br />
<br />Indepth Info of major players-
<br />
<br />Liberty- Descendants of the sleeper ship, &quot;Liberty&quot;, making planet fall on the planet Manhattan, and also the first of the houses to land. Believe in Manifest Destiny, and have economic interests in many parts of Sirius. Liberty is probably one of the more advanced and probably the most powerful force in Sirius. Things like homelsess seem to be against the law. Liberty's government is headed by the President. There's also a senate and judicial branches.
<br />
<br />Bretonia- Descendants of the sleeper ship &quot;Bretonia&quot;. Bretonia is a highly industrialzed region (many planets are overpopulated and badly polluted, reminscent of the Industrial Revolution). The economic conditions are good, and even the &quot;poorest&quot; are considered middle-class. The government is probably a Constitutional Monarchy. Much of Bretonia's economy is based in a variety of areas, mainly manufacturing and mining.
<br />
<br />Kusari- Descendants of the sleeper ship &quot;Kusari&quot;. Kusari is also advanced in their own way, but are not as lucky as the rest of the houses, as many of their colonies are either mainly water or massive gas giants. Kusari's government is somewhat similar to that of a Feudal Era Japan. Kusari makes a living off trade, weapon development, and gas mining.
<br />
<br />Rheinland- Descendants of the sleeper ship &quot;Rheinland&quot;. The sector of Rheinland is heavily industrialized, with much of the economy in mining, manufacturing, and weaponry. Most of their operations take place with in the Walker Cloud. Their army is hailed as one of the strongest, but the region has often gone through harsh economic trouble. A long and disaterous 80-year war with the Gas Miners' Guild resulted in a loss for Rheinland, disgracing them badly (The remains of their fleet can still be seen in Sigma-13). There is a thriving Black Market, and a vast underground society. The government has also been unstable. After the most recent war (Rheinland started it as a result of Nomad manipulation), they've lost most of their military strength, leaving only one battleship in their fleet, the Westfalen. The economy is fractured as well, and at one point in their history, they sold the sleeper ship Rheinland to Liberty to help pay debts.
<br />
<br />The Hispania- The lost sleeper ship. When launching from its launch site, it was hit in the engines, leaving it to straggle behind the other four sleeper ships. It arrived much later than the rest, and things got worse when an explosion rocked the ship's engines. The exact cause is unknown- Some blame a Coalition sabateur, others blaming an Alliance member trying to get more land, and some even blaming their own brothers for trying to get more for themselves. Eventually, two groups arised- One group took ships and manage to go to another sector, and landed in Planet Crete in Omicron Gamma, and became the Corsairs. The others piloted the crippled Hispania until it could go no further, and used the escape pods to go the nearby planet, and became the Outcasts.
<br />
<br />Outcasts- After landing on Malta in Omicron Alpha, the Outcasts were able to land on what seemed to be a hospitable planet. They later learned that the planet was rich in a plant that produced a drug called Cardamine. They found that they've become addicted to the planet, needing to be in proximity to it to survive (This was found when Outcasts who went scouting shortly died afterward). Cardamine was everywhere- in the air, in the water, and in their food. All Outcasts usually wear breathers to live outside their planet's atmosphere and carry small amounts of Cardamine to satisfy their needs, but they've gained some traits as well, mainly a much longer life cycle, though the birth rate is really low as a result of the genetic manipulation from Cardamine. The Outcasts make their living  off smuggling Cardamine, hoping to make a large earning once getting everyone addicted to it. Governed by a council of men known as the Elders.
<br />
<br />Corsairs- Landed on the dry and arid planet of Crete, and resorted to cannibalism to survive the first few years. Overtime, the population became stable, but life was still hard. One day, the Corsairs were able to capture the Rheinland science ship, the Schiller. Eventually, once the gained space travel, they resorted to piracy to get the things they needed- Food, water, technologies, and other things. Piracy was the only way they could survive. As another method of population control, Corsairs are required to go into the radioactive nebula north of the planet and retreive an artifact from the burial site unshielded, and dodging the mysterious presence there. Corsairs also make a trade off the Artifact trade, as their regions are littered with them. Corsairs, like the Outcasts, are very skilled pilots and fighters.  They are ruled over by a council of Elders.
