			<div class="content">Random Number:
<br />Most battles, technologies, and explorations use a random number system.  The Judge has a table of random #s between 1 and 10, and the random number chosen will decide these battles, etc.   
<br />
<br />
<br />Commodities:
<br />
<br />Metals
<br />H-Fuel
<br />Food 
<br />Water
<br />Oxygen
<br />
<br />Trade Agreements may be made in which one player agrees to trade commodities that they have to a player that wants them.  The other player must pay the first for these commodities.  Certain places have more commodities than others, which encourages trade.  The amount of commodities that you can trade is based on how many transports you want to devote to that trade agreement.  Each transport goes one way during your turn, selling the goods, and then returns in-between turns.
<br />
<br />Commodities in Systems:
<br />
<br />New York- 2 Metals, 4 Food

			<div class="content">Faction Classes:
<br />Each faction is given a class.  Depending on the class or house, the faction&#8217;s ships will be different.  There are several different things that outline the ship abilities for a faction:
<br />Fighter Attack- how well this ship attacks against other fighters.  (FA)
<br />Capital Ship Attack- how well this ship attacks capital ships. (CA)
<br />Fighter Defense- how well this ship defends against attacks by fighters.  (FD)
<br />Capital Ship Defense- how well this defends against attacks by capital ships.(CD)  
<br />

<br />Points must all be spent on the first turn.  They do not carry over.  Any points not used on the first turn will be lost.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p346618" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">The Outcasts and the Corsairs:
<br />These factions have a few paths that they may follow.  
<br />Path 1- They may band together and form a house called Hispania.  The leader of each of the old factions controls their same assets and forces, but the two factions are considered one house.  Basically, they are locked in a very close alliance.  They are allowed to build capital ship shipyards and capital ships.
<br />Their capital ship stats are:
<br />16 Gunboat
<br />18 Cruiser
<br />24 Dreadnought
<br />28 Battleship
<br />  Also, they may build jumpgates in certain systems (If they control both systems):
<br />Sigma-17-&gt;Omicron Theta
<br />Omicron Theta-&gt;Omicron Gamma
<br />Omicron Theta-&gt;Omicron Alpha
<br />Omicron Alpha-&gt;Omicron Beta
<br />Omicron Gamma-&gt;Omega-41
<br />Each set of jumpgates costs 150 credits.  They take 2 turns to build, after purchase.
<br />Path 2- They may remain independent pirate factions.  Each faction gets an extra 4 points for their VHFs to start.     
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Battles:
<br />The judge decides the battles based on the random number system.  
<br />The judge uses a board with 40 squares on it, placed in 10x4 fashion.  One half is the attacker&#8217;s side, the other is the defender&#8217;s.  Each side is labeled with the numbers 1-10.  The judge places markers on the board for the attacker and defender&#8217;s capital ships and fighters, in the slots corresponding to each ship&#8217;s attack/defense rating, depending on the type of fleet that they are fighting.  If they are fighting a fleet with ANY capital ships, then use the capital ship attack/defense rating.  If the enemy force is only fighters, then the fighter attack/defense rating is used.  The battle is played out, using the Axis and Allies method.  In the A+A method, random numbers are chosen for each ship, and if it is equal to or less than that ship&#8217;s rating, then it scores a hit.  The weakest piece used by the defender is removed.  It continues, until one side has no pieces left.  That side will then be declared the winner. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Retreating from a Battle-
<br />Once a battle has been declared by the attacker, then no more forces may be moved in or out of the system in which the battle is occurring. The attacker may choose to retreat for one real-time day after the battle has been declared.
<br />
<br />Destroying Another Faction&#8217;s Station-
<br />The revolutionary bombers and all faction's battleships are the only units that can destroy stations. The defending station gets a 4 or lower shot at every bomber, or a 2 or lower shot at each battleship, and then the bombers or battleships are able to use their CA value to attack. If a hit is scored, then the station is destroyed. If not, then the process is repeated until either the station is destroyed, or the bombers or battleships are all dead.
<br />
<br />How to Self-Destruct a Base-
<br />If you control a Small Station, Large Station, or Shipyard, and for whatever reason want to get rid of it, you may cause it to self-destruct. You lose all ships on the station when you do so. Planets cannot self-destruct, for obvious reasons.
<br />
<br />Stealing Capital Ships:
<br />Non-house factions can steal capital ships from a house.  There are two ways to do this.  
<br />In-system strikes- The attacker attacks from a base in the same system as the target capital ship.  Only the capital ship and the ships stationed at the same base as it are fought.  
<br />Inter-system strikes- The attacker attacks from an adjacent system.  The attacker must fight all the house&#8217;s ships in the system in order to take the capital ship.  
<br />
<br />In a strike, the attacker moves his force to attack the capital ship.  Battle is fought until the capital ship is the only ship left defending, or the attackers are eliminated.  A number is then chosen.  If it is 7-10, then the attempt fails, and the surviving attackers return to their base.  If it is a 1-6, then the capital ship is taken by the attackers and is taken back to their base.  Only one capital ship may be taken per attack.
<br />
<br />Jumpholes: 
<br />No ship larger than a gunboat may pass between systems only connected by jumpholes.  If two systems are connected by jumpgates and jumpholes, then ships larger than gunboats may pass freely between those two systems.
<br />
<br />Grace Period:
<br />Each faction gets a grace period for their first three turns of play.  They may not be attacked by a PC faction for those turns.  If a PC faction attacks them, then disciplinary action will be taken.  If the faction attacks another faction during the grace period, then it is nullified.
<br />
<br />Corporation-Owned Shipyards:  
<br />There are several corporations in the game that have shipyards.  If they are PC, then the corporation gets to keep the shipyard, and they can build gunboats there.  They can barter with a house for the plans for that house's capital ships, and if they get them, then they can build capital ships with the same stats of the house's at the shipyard.  If the shipyard is NPC, then it is turned over to the house who owns the system, and the house can use it to build their own cap ships.

			<div class="content">Secrecy- 
<br />Secrecy is an integral part of every lawless faction&#8217;s life.  Certain bases may NOT be known to other factions unless searched for.  
<br />
<br />These bases are:
<br />Buffalo Base, New York (Rogues)
<br />Rochester Base, New York (Junkers)
<br />Ouray Base, Colorado (Xenos)
<br />Beaumont Base, Texas (Junkers)
<br />Alcatraz Depot, California (Rogues)
<br />Willard Research Station, California (Navy)
<br />Nome Base, Kepler (Xenos)
<br />Padua Base, Galileo (Rogues)
<br />Leiden Base, Galileo (Hackers)
<br />Pacifica Base, Bering (Unioners)
<br />Dawson Base, Hudson (Rogues)
<br />Barrow Base, Hudson (Xenos)
<br />Mactan Base, Magellan (Hackers)
<br />Montezuma Base, Cortez (Rogues)
<br />BPA Newgate, Manchester (Bretonia Police)
<br />Trafalgar Base, New London (Junkers)
<br />Islay Base, Edinburgh (Gaians)
<br />Arranmore Base, Dublin (Mollys)
<br />Graves Station, Dublin (BMM)
<br />Vierlande Base, Hamburg (Rheinland Federal Police)
<br />Kreuzburg Depot, New Berlin (Junkers)
<br />Darmstadt Depot, Stuttgart (LWB}
<br />Vogtland Base, Dresden (Red Hessians)
<br />Bruchsal Base, Frankfurt (Bundschuh)
<br />Nansei Research Station, Kyushu (Naval Forces)
<br />Kagoshima Depot, Kyushu (Farmer&#8217;s Alliance)
<br />Kabuicho Depot, New Tokyo (Hogosha)
<br />Fuchu Prison, Shikoku (Kusari State Police)
<br />Ainu Depot, Hokkaido (GC)
<br />Java Station, Tau-23 (IMG)
<br />Cali Base, Tau-23 (Outcasts)
<br />Falkland Base, Tau-37 (IMG)
<br />Douglas Station, Omega-3 (BMM)
<br />Rugen Station, Omega-3 (Daumann)
<br />Cadiz Base, Omega-5 (Corsairs)
<br />Ronneburg Base, Omega-5 (Red Hessians)
<br />Briesen Mining Facility, Omega-7 (Daumann)
<br />Elbich Mining Facility, Omega-7 (Kruger)
<br />Freital Base, Omega-11 (Red Hessians)
<br />Leon Base, Omega-41 (Corsairs)
<br />Freeport 5, Omega-41 (Zoners)
<br />Tripoli Shipyard, Omicron Gamma (Corsairs)
<br />Ruiz Base, Omicron Beta (Outcasts)
<br />Atka Research Station, Sigma-17 (Cryer)
<br />Yanagi Depot, Sigma-13 (Junkers)
<br />
<br />Note: You can only build a hidden base in a system where either you or a close ally already has a hidden base.
<br />
<br />Factions looking for one of these bases may send out a force to attempt to locate it.  A random number is chosen, and the number determines what happens.
<br />
<br />If the number is a 9 or 10, then the entire force is lost, and never heard from again.
<br />If the number is 5-8, then the force returns without finding the base.
<br />If the number is a 3 or 2, then the force finds the base.  One round of battle takes place with the search force versus the enemy forces at that base.  If there are survivors in the attack force, then the survivors return with the location of the base.  The base may now be attacked.
<br />If the number is a 1, then the search force uses stealth to find the base and return undetected.  No battle is fought, and the force returns with the location.  
<br />
<br />There are also certain secret systems.  
<br />They are:
<br />Omicron Alpha
<br />Omicron Gamma
<br />Chugoku
<br />
<br />The pattern above is used for the systems, with forces from a connecting system looking for a jumphole to the system.  If a battle is fought, then it is against all the defending forces in the whole hidden system.

			<div class="content">Exploration-
<br />Factions have an opportunity to explore for other systems.  A faction can send an explore party out, and it can explore deep space for a system.
<br />Outcomes are:
<br />If the random # is 10-6, then the team is lost, and never heard from again.
<br />If it is 5-2, then the team returns without finding a system.  You get 1 wing of LF.
<br />If it is a 1, then the team finds a system.  In that case, another number is chosen to determine what is in the system.
<br />If it is 10-6, then there are no planets.
<br />If it is 5-4, then there is one planet that can be terraformed.
<br />If it is 3-2, then there is one planet suitable for life.
<br />If it is 1, then there is one planet suitable for life, and another one that can be terraformed.
<br />Each new system contains one of each commodity. 
<br />
<br />Research-
<br />Factions can research a few things.
<br />Bomber- factions that do not already have a Bomber can research one.  #1-2, success, #3-10, failure.
<br />Ship Bonuses- factions can increase one of the ratings of one of their ships. Only one rating may be increased per ship type, per faction.  #1-3, success, #4-10, failure.
<br />
<br />Piracy-
<br />If you are a pirate or revolutionary faction, then you may choose to use some of your units to attempt to steal commodities travelling through a system that you have units in.  A random # is chosen, and if it is a 4 or lower, then all the commodities being shipped are turned over to the pirates.  If not, then the pirates return, and the convoy continues.  This may only be done once per system for every pirate faction. 
<br />
<br />Turns-
<br />1. Place Units- Units may be placed from last turn.
<br />2. Purchase Units- Units may be bought and paid for, but not placed.
<br />3. Alliance/Trade Agreement- Players may offer each other alliances or trade agreements.
<br />4. Move Units/Declare Battles- You may move any of your units up to three systems.  (Five if all of them are connected by trade lanes.)  However, you must not be hostile to any of the factions that own these systems unless you are attacking them.
<br />5. Calculate Your New Income.
<br />
<br />Turn Posts:
<br />There are things I would like in all turn posts other than what is above.
<br />-Current ship stat list
<br />-Current base and fleet location
<br />-Any secret bases that you have found
<br />-Anything that a judge has yet to resolve for you
<br />
<br />Ships in Systems:
<br />Every ship in a system must be stationed at a base in that system.  If another faction wishes to attack one base in a system, rather then the entire system, then the defenders would be the ships stationed at the base.  If a faction chooses to attack an entire system, then all the enemy ships in the system are defenders.  If a faction takes over a system from another faction, then the faction gets all of the other faction&#8217;s bases in that system automatically.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p346623" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Other Rules:
<br />
<br />Only Freelancer Factions- Only the EXISTING factions from the game, Freelancer, may be used here. No new factions may be created and/or used by a player.
<br />NO EXCEPTIONS!
<br />
<br />Absent- If you are absent from the RPG for a day or two, you have a few choices:
<br />A- Leave it as it is, and sacrifice your turns. You may add money and commodities when you get back, but no purchases or movement/battles.
<br />B- Turn it over to a friend or ally.
<br />C- Turn it over to a judge.
<br />Note: If you are leaving the game, then you may NOT give your whole faction away permanently to another player.  The faction becomes NPC with all the units and bases you had.  If you happen to return, you may pick up where you left off, but you get NO compensation for the turns you lost.  This rule automatically kicks in for an unexcused absence of over a week.  
<br />
<br />Discipline-
<br />Unfortunately, players sometimes break the rules.  Here is what happens when you break any of the rules.
<br />1st offense- Warning by judge.
<br />2nd offense- Warning by admin.
<br />3rd offense- You must send an email to a judge or admin within two days of the offense, telling what you did, why you did it, and how you will fix it.
<br />4th offense- Your CPT amount is cut in half for a week.
<br />5th offense- You will be asked to leave the game.
<br />These apply for ANY breach of the rules.  They are flexible, and judges and admins can choose to be nicer, but they CANNOT be more strict than this.
<br />
<br />Promotions-
<br />Depending on how many rounds of CYOF you play, you can get moved up in the ranks.
<br />
<br />Player Rankings:
<br />
<br />Veteran Status- A veteran player.  Must have played one full round of CYOF.
<br />
<br />Ace Status- A very skilled player; knowledgeable of the game and rules.  Must have played two full rounds of CYOF.
<br />
<br />Admiral Status- A CYOF regular.  Must have played three full rounds of CYOF.
<br />
<br />President Status- A CYOF master.  Must have played five full rounds of CYOF.
<br />
<br />Administrative Rankings:
<br />
<br />Judge- Must be a veteran or higher, and must be invited by a admin.  Judges control most aspects of the gameplay.  They resolve battles, researches, etc. 
<br />
<br />Admin- Must have judged one full CYOF round.  Admins are in charge of all of the things that take place outside of the gameplay itself.  They are given editing access to the CYOF site, and they are in charge of recruitment.
<br />
<br />Rulemaster- Must be an admin.  If the current rulemaster retires, then the admins get to create new sets of CYOF rules, and submit them to the retired rulemaster.  The rulemaster then chooses the best set of rules, and the writer gets to become the next rulemaster.  Rulemasters are in charge of the rules, and are admins at the same time.  This is the highest rank one can possible get. 
<br />Note- One round of CYOF refers to officially sanctioned rounds of CYOF.  Beta-tests do not count.</div>

			<div class="content">Thank you very much jacob. The game begins. 
<br />
<br />Edit: I'm currently a veteran, even tho I joined CYOF 1 about halfway through...shouldn't that count for something?
<br />
<br />Base list:
<br />Ronneburg Base, Omega 5. 15 LF wings
<br />Vogtland Base, Dresden. 20 LF wings
<br />Freital Base, Omega 11. 15 LF wings
<br />
<br />Ship point distribution:
<br />&quot;Blade&quot; Class LF: FA 6, CA 1, FD 4, CD 1 (10 points, 2 free points)
<br />&quot;Rapier&quot; class HF: FA 2, CA 6, FD 2, CD 4 (14 points)
<br />&quot;Demon&quot; class VHF: FA 4, CA 6, FD 3, CD 5 (18 points)
<br />&quot;Firelord&quot; class Bomber: FA 3, CA 7, FD 1, CA 5 (16 points)
<br />
<br />Known Hidden Bases:
<br />Ronneburg, Vogtland, Freital, Tripoli, Leon, Cadiz, Crete, Bruschal, 2 shipyards under construction.
<br />
<br />Known Hidden Systems:
<br />Omicron Gamma
<br />
<br />Hessian Turn 1 
<br />
<br />1. nothing to place
<br />
<br />2. I build 2 fighter shipyards, 6 Corsair VHF wings
<br />
<br />3. In accordance to discussion and negotiation occurring over the secure channel (i.e. email), I propose an end to fighting with the Corsair faction and an alliance. I furthermore propose an alliance to the Outcasts and call to them to join in the Pirate&#8217;s League. I propose a 3rd alliance to the Bundschuh and call for them to unite with us in ending the corruption that plagues our state of Rhineland. An alliance is also proposed to Kusari, who have multiple times in the past suffered at the hands of the Rhineland expansionists. We lastly propose a peace agreement with Bretonia.
<br />
<br />4. ATTACKS: I move 10 LF from Omega 5 and 5 LF each from Dresden and Omega 11 to attack Freeport 1 (Zoner Base, large) in Omega 3. The system is claimed in the name of the Pirate&#8217;s League. 
<br />
<br />I move 5 LF from Dresden and 5 from Omega 11 to attack Freistadt station (IMG station, small).  In accordance to talks with the Corsairs over email, we are expecting help from them in taking either Freistadt or Freeport 1.
<br />
<br />I claim Omegas 11 and 5 for the Pirate&#8217;s League.
<br />
<br />5. I collect (base income: 140 + turn income: 45=185 + bonus: 250) 435 credits, - 300 credits= 135 - 120= 15 left over.
<br />Commodity income: Commodity income: 23 M/1 H-F/ 4 W/ 2 F/ 9 O
<br />
<br />Transmission to Rhineland: If you do not immediately declare the corporations of Kruger Minerals Inc., Republican Shipping, and Daumann Industries illegal in Rhineland space, you will be declared Enemies of the State and attacked without pity.
<br />
<br />Transmission to Bretonia: Our heavily superior force at Freeport 1 will clearly take the base and therefore system in the name of the Pirate&#8217;s League. We realize that Omega 3 is a system you would desire control over. Therefore in return for a peace agreement, and building rights in Cambridge and Leeds we will give you building rights in all League controlled systems and control of Omega 3.
<br />
<br />So it begins&#8230;
<br />
<br />Edit: I have changed my turn because it was still turn 1 when changes in the league were made, so all our commodity and base income was increased.

<br />You can become an ace in a week or so, since you joined CYOF 1 about 1/3 of the way through.

<br />Any veterans or above can apply to become the 2nd judge for CYOF 3.  Sign up by sending me an email.  First come, first served!

			<div class="content">I would take the system by claiming control of it through its largest base--that being Freeport 1. Essentially the same way you claimed the Taus and Omegas in the last game, except my character likes to fight for his bases rather than merely march forces into a system and claim it. Following the battle, if you want, all fighter wings will vacate the base and allow you to overtake it.
<br />
<br />Sorry, Omega 7 will remain-- at least for now--under control of the League. After the battle, at least. You will have building rights in that system. Perhaps, if Triyun allows it, we may share control.
<br />
<br />TO ALL FACTIONS: Omegas 11 and 5 are most directly League territory. ANY faction entering into these systems or building bases in them will be declared enemies of the Red Council.
<br />
<br />Controlled systems:
<br />Omega 11
<br />Omega 5
<br />Omega 7
<br />Omega 3 (until battle finishes)
<br />
<br />Systems for which I have legal building rights:
<br />All controlled systems
<br />Omega 3
<br />Cambridge*
<br />Manchester*
<br />
<br />Edit: they're fighter shipyards, don't worry. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />*These are in return for allowing Bretonia building rights in League territory.

<br />To all non-criminal factions:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>There is a storm brewing in Sirius. One that, if we do not act quickly to defend ourselves, threatens to consume us all in the fires of destruction. Recent intelligence indicates that a great &#8220;League of Pirates&#8221; is being formed with the Outcasts, Corsairs and Red Hessians at its core. This unholy alliance exists with the sole purpose of destroying all that we have worked so hard to rebuild since the Nomad Incident. We must not let this happen. I implore all legitimate factions to take up arms against these aggressors. And do not let their protestations of innocence fool you. We have seen that they will stop at nothing to kill all who seem to stand in their way. If you do not believe me, look at what has been done to the Zoners. The Red Hessians have launched a full-scale assault on Freeport 1 in Omega-3. What did the Zoners do to deserve this? Nothing. The Zoners have always been a neutral faction, open to all. And here we have the vile Hessians committing a most contemptible act of violence against these people. This is but a taste of what is to come. If we do not act quickly to defend ourselves and move to expunge the foul pirates we will see nothing but destruction.
<br />
<br />I hereby extend an offer of peace to all Houses, Corporations and Guilds.     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />To Stormtrooper10, Leader of the Bundschuh:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>I am not the former Chancellors. In fact, ideologically, you and I are not different at all. I have simply chosen the path of politics while you chose revolution. We both want the same thing, that which is best for the people of Rheinland. As a show of good faith, I extend this invitation to you: please come to New Berlin that we may speak face to face. I would also like to have you address the Reichstag. I feel that now is the perfect time for a fresh start. Let us work together for the good of the citizens of Rheinland.
<br />
<br />Above all else I must warn you against being swayed by the rhetoric of the Red Hessians. They desire nothing but destruction. Their claims of ending corruption are nothing but empty promises.     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />To Orion van Haalein, Leader of the Red Hessians:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>You gave me an ultimatum. I hate ultimatums. I resolve to hunt you down wherever you may be. I will find your secret bases and wipe Sirius clean of the stain that is your existence.     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />To Connarius, Leader of the Zoners:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>I would like to express my deepest sorrow for the brutal attack the Red Hessians have launched against you. You have done nothing to raise their ire and yet they treat you as they would treat me. While I do not agree with your policy of sheltering criminals I recognize that such acts are within your rights. Should you wish it, I would be honoured to ally myself with you. I will gladly give you any aid I can if it will help you avenge the wrongs perpetrated against you by the Red Hessians.     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I think that should cover everything.
