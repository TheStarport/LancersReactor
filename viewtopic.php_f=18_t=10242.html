			<div class="content">Hey all,
<br />
<br />I'd like to first say that I'm inexperienced in the art of modding. I can understand the easy concepts, such as playing with an .ini file, but that's about it I would think. However, this isn't a teach me thread <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> We all know Freelancher is missing things that we might love and hold dear to our hearts. And, with modding, it -might- be able to be included! But can it be done? Well, that's what I'm asking you for. I'm not sure what things I could expect to be reasonably accomplished to the flat out impossible. Therefore, I'll expect answers ranging from, &quot;Sure, there's a line for that in one of the data file sets' to 'No way buddy, not unless you hack the program more then Charles Manson.' Or maybe even the elusive, 'Not unless Digital Anvil allows for it in an upcoming patch.' So please, read or skim, and from what you know of the program maybe you can answer this or that. This same list is also being sent to Microsoft Feedback for Freelancher <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Thanks!
<br />
<br />ANTICHEATER DETECTOR
<br />1) Will it be possible for the server to check for cheaters? Are there any plans by the community in development to take care of this problem? 
<br />-I'm not sure if this would be possible, as from how I hear of it there aren't any integrated checks to make sure everythings even. Well, here's hoping for patch.
<br />
<br />SHIP COMPONENTS
<br />2) Add in upgradable components for ships - in particurlar armor, engines, and afterburners. Armor increases hull strength. Engines increase your top and cruise speed. Afterburners could go faster and/or use less energy. 
<br />-I have no idea if this can be done, but if it can it would add this bit more depth to the game!
<br />
<br />SHIP CUSTOMIZING
<br />3) Each ship would be unique; light fighters would be noticably faster and more maneuverable then line, heavy, or very heavy fighters. Essential stats would be altered as seen fit to make the choice between ships more a personal preference of fighting styles then anything else. This, as well as adding the ability to pilot single player ships such as Trains or Gunships, is possible now; just takes forever to read those odd files.
<br />
<br />FACTION AI
<br />4) If your friendly with a faction and you're being attacked, they help you. Or perhaps this ability should be limited only to the police or military. 
<br />-Once again a coin toss in the air. Don't know if the AI can be capable of reacting in such a way with so many PCs.
<br />
<br />MP FACTION TOUGHNESS
<br />5) Every 1 out of 4 spawned police, military, or pirate patrols will be stronger then normal. 1 out of 10 much stronger. This to ensure the random difficulty levels of potential opponents; you'll never really know what to expect.
<br />-I would assume that this be an easier order then the previous one, since a spawn script has to be told something ...
<br />
<br />DEATH PENALTY
<br />6) As is, no one really, and I mean -really- cares about dying. Resurrection is only a button away. To make the threat of death more potent, and perhaps even fearful, stricter death measures would have to be enacted. Three things could be done, in my opinion. a) Money loss. Die enough times, and you'll be too poor to fix, upgrade, or trade with your ship. IOW, mining for you! b) You have a certain number of lives. Once their used up, their used up and your character is deleted. That would make you a bit nervous ... c) combination of a and b.
<br />-Again, I'm not familiar with the respawn process. Is it automatic and as is? Or is there grounds for leeway, to add your own little spice to death?
<br />
<br />X-Impossible!
<br />7) Most likely impossible, but you know I have to ask. I'll state that unless it's patched for features (somewhat an odd thing to say, as patches usually fix bugs) I'll keep on dreaming. Quick chat commands, like BF42. Num0 = &quot;I'm under fire!&quot; Num1 = &quot;Fly in formation.&quot; Adding the variable for fuel as another bar below the red hull one (heh, adding code to the game to track consumption and refueling, yeck!) Making the chat easier to use, with toggle keys and longer messages allowable. Factions to which you are most green to have their tag appear with your name (Navy - Coda A27). 
<br />
<br />Did I miss something? Anything? The above combined with a 64 player server would make for a tense, gritty setting with lots of alliances and politics of various guilds and clans. r0XX0rz.
