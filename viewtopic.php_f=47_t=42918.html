<br />EPISODE 1: &#8220;FREELANCER 2&#8221; 
<br />

<br />
<br />(MST3K Love Theme)
<br />
<br />In the very distant future,
<br />About 3000 AD
<br />There was this guy named Trent
<br />Not too different from you or me
<br />
<br />He worked for nobody but himself
<br />Caring for little else but his wealth
<br />He did a great job flying round the place,
<br />But his some villains didn&#8217;t like him
<br />So they shot him into space!!!!
<br />
<br />(Trent: But I was in space already!) 
<br />
<br />We'll send him crappy fanfics
<br />The worst we can find  (lalala)
<br />He'll have to sit and read them all and we'll monitor his mind  (lalala)
<br />
<br />Now keep in mind Trent can't control
<br />When the fanfics begin or end  (lalala)
<br />Because he used those special parts
<br />To teleport in his friends;
<br />
<br />GOOD GUY ROLL CALL:
<br />
<br />CAMBOT!
<br />(Smile please!) 
<br />
<br />PAULO!
<br />(Trent? Who&#8217;s that?)
<br />
<br />JUNI!
<br />(I *won&#8217;t* kill him for this)
<br />
<br />KIIIIIIIIIIING!!!
<br />(I need a drink&#8230; )
<br />
<br />If you&#8217;re wondering how Trent eats and breathes
<br />And other science facts  (lalala)
<br />Then repeat to yourself
<br />It's just a MST
<br />You should really just relax
<br />for MYSTERY FL THEATER 3000!!!! (guitar twang)
<br />
<br />SATELLITE OF LOVE: 
<br />
<br />A Hispanic man in his late teens/early twenties enters from the right. He is dressed in a Corsair flight suit. Crashing and banging noises, as well as yells can be heard coming from behind him. He notices the camera and looks at it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh, you must be Cambot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;from what that guy Trent said you are be transmitting live to the rest of the sector&#8230;&#8221; The realisation leaps onto his face like lightning. &#8220;I&#8217;m on TV!&#8221; He manages to stop himself from becoming too excited and looks back at the camera. &#8220;I guess you viewers want to know what&#8217;s happening? Fine then. I am Paulo Collazo, mighty pirate. Apparently this guy called Trent, who needed us to help with something, brought us here. By us I mean me, a Kusari woman, and a Libertonian man&#8221; Suddenly a bald, moustachioed man, wearing an LSF uniform, runs in from the direction of the noises, briefly stops to look at the camera, then continues running off to the left, barely dodging a thrown piece of equipment. Paulo lets him pass, then continues.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think he said his name was King. As for the Kusari woman, she&#8217;s the one kicking up all the fuss back there. Apparently she wasn&#8217;t too happy with Trent bringing all three of us here. Personally I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m here, they seem to know each other but I haven&#8217;t met any of them before&#8221; There is a thud and all the crashes and smashing abruptly stops. Paulo glances off to the right, grimaces, and then looks back to the camera. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be right back&#8221;
<br />
<br />**COMMERCIAL**
<br />Synth Foods Paste
<br />Enjoy the delicious taste
<br />So sugar free is our mush
<br />You won&#8217;t even have to brush!
<br />**END COMMERCIAL**
<br />
<br />As the picture fades back in, we see Paulo and King sitting at the table with the aforementioned Trent, a blonde man in a brown jacket, and Juni, a Kusari woman in an LSF uniform. King is bandaging Trent&#8217;s head, while Paulo wisely sits between him and the still raging (albeit silently) Juni, preventing any further injury.
<br />
<br />&#8220;OW!&#8221; Trent yelled, knocking King&#8217;s hands away as he did it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;If you&#8217;d hold still, this would be done a long time ago&#8230; There!&#8221;  He moves away to reveal Trent&#8217;s head wrapped up like a mummy.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Great! Now I can&#8217;t see!&#8221; Trent stands up and stumbles off-camera. A short while later a clattering is heard.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Anyway&#8230;&#8221; Paulo says when Trent returns, having completely thrown off the bandages, &#8220;does anybody know why we&#8217;re here?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I BELIEVE I CAN ANSWER THAT!&#8221; A loud booming voice filled the room and the wall behind the group lit up in static. They all turn just in time for the wall to become a viewscreen, showing a man in a starkly green lab coat with crazy hair, a moustache and green-rimmed glasses. &#8220;MY NAME IS&#8230;ahem&#8230;&#8221; his voice returns to normal levels &#8220;my name is Dr Clayton Forrester, evil genius extraordinaire!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;WHY HAVE YOU FORCED US HERE!&#8221; Juni screams. She gets off her chair, and then throws it at the viewscreen. Unfortunately it only bounces off.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;My dear,&#8221; Forrester continues with a smile, &#8220;you are here to participate in an experiment. In layman&#8217;s, i.e. your, terms, I will show you a piece of literature, and if it successfully drives you insane, I will use it to conquer the Sirius Sector! Hahahahahah!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ll never do it,&#8221; Paulo growls stubbornly with his arms crossed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll sit it out without oxygen!&#8221; Forrester chuckles, reaching for a button out of sight.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine! Fine!&#8221; Trent leaps up before Forrester can push it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good. Now, my guinea pigs, get into that theatre because you have&#8230;FANFIC SIGN!!!&#8221; He cackles and switches off the viewscreen just before Juni can attack again with her chair.
<br /> 
<br />&#8220;Now what?&#8221; asks King. Suddenly alarms and klaxons ring through the satellite and the lights all start flashing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Guess that answers your question,&#8221; Trent replies. They get together and grab Juni, then drag her through the door into the theatre.  
<br />
<br />(Due to its size, this continues onto the next post)

<br />
<br />*They enter the theatre and sit down in this order: King, Paulo, Trent, and Juni*
<br />
<br />Trent: We can&#8217;t let that guy win, just play it cool.
<br />Juni: *still angry* Grrrrrrrrr&#8230;
<br />King: Hey, why are we talking like this now?
<br />Paulo: Makes it easier on the eyes for the reader.
<br />*CRASH*
<br />King: What was that!
<br />Paulo: Sounded like the fourth wall breaking, nothing important.
<br />Trent: Shhh, it&#8217;s starting.
<br />
<br />*The fic begins to scroll by on the theatre screen*
<br />
<br />&gt;Freelancer 2 
<br />
<br />Paulo: Let me guess&#8230;Revenge of the Nomads?
<br />Juni: The Author gets what&#8217;s coming to him?
<br />Trent: Trent finally gets paid?
<br />King: King finally gets laid?
<br />Others: 0_o
<br />King: What!?
<br />
<br />&gt;The Intro Is When The Nomads Came Into a Secret System
<br />
<br />Trent: Shhh! It&#8217;s a secret!
<br />Paulo: (David Attenborough)  Here, in the Secret System, a group of Nomads come to the watering hole.
<br />
<br />&gt;unknown to even their leader, This system was The Terrence System 
<br />
<br />Juni: What! What sort of name is that for a system! *swings her katana over her head*
<br />Trent: Take it easy! *ducks katana*
<br />King: And where&#8217;d that sword come from?
<br />
<br />&gt;Run by 2 secret factions, The Terrence Team and the Saiya-jins 
<br />
<br />All: KA - ME - HA - ME -HA!
<br />
<br />&gt;Thoe too teams wanted revenge because the last people that &quot;owned&quot; 
<br />
<br />Paulo: You mean &#8216;pwned&#8217;, surely.
<br />Trent: WTF! I R teh l337 hx0r!
<br />Juni: STFU!
<br />Trent: N00B!
<br />Juni: OMGWTFBBQ!
<br />King: lol.
<br />
<br />&gt;the sirus system did the same thing that happened to the Nomads so doese 
<br />
<br />King: This fic is making me &#8216;doese&#8217; 
<br />
<br />&gt;teams teamed up to distroy the Exact thing that holds the Sirus System togeter, 
<br />
<br />Juni: Blu-tack?
<br />Trent: String?
<br />Paulo: The Force?
<br />
<br />&gt;the core of it, The New York System
<br />
<br />All: Oh.
<br />Trent: Funny how a single system somehow single-handedly keeps an entire sector together.
<br />
<br />&gt;(3 Months Later)
<br />
<br />King: (Author) Zzz&#8230;Huh! What! Oh sorry, I got so bored writing this I fell asleep.
<br />
<br />&gt;The Order Has Gotten Bored Since they had to wait 
<br />
<br />Trent: (Orillion in whiney kid voice) I don&#8217;t wanna wait! Gimme something to do!
<br />
<br />&gt;so most of them went in to check if the Nomads are doing good in there 
<br />
<br />Paulo: (Order Pilot) Hey Nomads, doing anything good? Not planning to conquer humanity I hope.
<br />Juni: (Nomad) Of course not, just ignore the Battleship sneaking up behind you.
<br />
<br />&gt;because their scanners have picked up somthing unknown and weird then it looked 
<br />&gt;like they where in a Jump Gate and then the next thing they know is alot of new 
<br />&gt;ships, a Nomad Bomber, Someone Flying in space with a Yellow Arua Covering 
<br />&gt;then Bang their in the Freelanceing World in the sky
<br />
<br />Trent: Err&#8230;
<br />King: If anyone could make sense of that last section, please tell us.
<br />
<br />&gt;Orillion Servived and went off to tell trent and the others
<br />
<br />King: (Orillion) Trent! Good thing I found you! We&#8217;re under attack from Saiya-jins and some guys called Terrence!
<br />Trent: (Trent) Bwhahahahahahaha! &#8230; Oh wait, you&#8217;re serious.
<br />
<br />&gt;Mission 1:
<br />&gt;You start with a Anubis because you are part of the order
<br />
<br />Juni: (Customer) I&#8217;d like to order a Trent Supreme please.
<br />Trent: (Waiter) Certainly ma&#8217;am, any Hakkera Fries with that?
<br />
<br />&gt;Oriilion Comes and tells Trent What Happened And The Mission /is To Find The 
<br />&gt;Cloaked Planet to find the cloak Device
<br />
<br />Paulo: Good thing that &#8216;Orillion&#8217; had already told him, or he might not have believed him.
<br />Trent: Wait&#8230;where did this cloaked planet come from?
<br />King: The same place Jacobi&#8217;s kidnapping did; left field.
<br />
<br />&gt;Part One, Getting Blowen Off By Nomads
<br />
<br />King: Sounds fun.
<br />Juni: King!
<br />King: What?
<br />Juni: There may be kids reading this!
<br />King: Bite me!
<br />
<br />&gt;Part two, Nomads Still Coming
<br />&gt;Part 3, To To trade Lane
<br />&gt;Part 4: Distroy the Nomad Fleet
<br />&gt;Part 5: Dock
<br />
<br />All: (signing) I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay, wasting time&#8230;
<br />
<br />&gt;Mission 1 B:
<br />
<br />&gt;Part 1: Cloak
<br />&gt;Part 2: De Cloak And Fire Super Misspitos 
<br />
<br />Trent: (Salesman) That&#8217;s right! Misspitos! Guaranteed to NOT hit what you are aiming for!
<br />Paulo: (Salesman) Buy now and get a discount on all Dodgssiles!
<br />
<br />&gt;Part 3: Blow Up The Nomad Base
<br />&gt;Par 4: Defend Juni
<br />
<br />Trent: FORE!
<br />King: I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be able to score a hole-in-one there Trent.
<br />Juni: Why do I feel I should be stabbing you for that?
<br />
<br />&gt;Trent told Orillion that he distroyed their super base but Orillion said they are more 
<br />&gt;but you have to get stronger 
<br />
<br />Trent: (singing) The hours approaching, just give it your best, you got to reach your prime.
<br />Juni: (singing) That&#8217;s when you need to put yourself to the test, and show us a passage of time.
<br />Paulo: (singing) Were going to need a MONTAGE!
<br />
<br />&gt;Because They have a whole other system from that hole you made and they have 
<br />&gt;gotten stronger since last time 
<br />
<br />Trent: How conveeeeeniiiieeeent.
<br /> 
<br />&gt;Then Trent Said So When is the next guy who will somehow come here and show 
<br />&gt;me an artifact... 
<br />
<br />Juni: I thought I lost him when he &#8216;fell&#8217; out of the airlock, but he&#8217;s just like a bad smell.
<br />King: He keeps coming back?
<br />Juni: No, he just has really bad BO.
<br />Others: *groan*
<br />
<br />&gt;then sombody did have an artifact that had electisity and Red Arua around it
<br />
<br />Trent: Another one! Why does everybody keep coming to me with these things, I&#8217;m not a freaking archaeologist!
<br />
<br />&gt;Mission 2: 
<br />&gt;Orillion Wants Trent, Juni, and King to Come To Mannhation For a mission to 
<br />&gt;distroy the Red Bomber and the fleet Shild Covering it 
<br />
<br />Paulo: (Red Bomber) If I can&#8217;t see you, you can&#8217;t see me!
<br />
<br />&gt;1: Run From The Saiya-jins
<br />&gt;2: Zap Their Heads Off
<br />&gt;3: Beat The Whole Terrence System Fleet
<br />
<br />King: (Trent) With a name like that, they can&#8217;t win!
<br />
<br />&gt;4: Eat
<br />&gt;5: Use The Bathroom
<br />
<br />Paulo: That reminds me&#8230;I think that&#8217;s our time for a break.
<br />Trent: About time! *Tries to push past Juni*
<br />Juni: Ah-ha! No you don&#8217;t! *The katana is now pointing at Trent&#8217;s stomach*
<br />Trent: Okay! You first.
<br />*They exit in reverse order*
<br />
<br />SATELITE OF LOVE:
<br />
<br />&#8220;And now we&#8217;re talking like this again!&#8221; King shouts as he enters the room.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; Paulo mutters. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; Juni chips in. She certainly seems happier than before.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I got all of you to help me. That might have made me insane if you hadn&#8217;t been here,&#8221; Trent says, sounding relieved.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait&#8230;&#8221; Juni&#8217;s smile slowly becomes a frown, &#8220;you only brought us here to stop yourself going crazy&#8230;&#8221; She slowly walks towards Trent. &#8220;TALK ABOUT SELFISH!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Er&#8230;calm down dear, its only a commercial&#8221; Trent backs into a wall while saying this. Paulo turns to the camera.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You heard him Cambot, roll commercials&#8221; As the image fades screams of pain can be heard in the background.
<br />
<br />**COMMERCIAL**
<br />Starfliers! 
<br />The greatest ships in the universe!
<br />Perfect for the budding Freelancer!
<br />Satisfaction or you money back, guaranteed!
<br />(Not a guarantee)
<br />**END COMMERCIAL**
<br />
<br />Fading in, we see the room in ruins; the walls scorched black and smoke pouring from damaged consoles. Paulo and King peek over the top the table, the only thing still standing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Is it over,&#8221; King says quietly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Paulo replies. A look of horror appears on his face when he looks left and he screams. &#8220;Ahhhhhhhh! Stay away!&#8221; Juni walks in from the left. However, she seems happy now.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I think I&#8217;ve vented my anger now,&#8221; she says with a grin. Trent walks in behind her, covered in bruises, his clothes ripped and half his hair and eyebrows burnt off.
<br />
<br />&#8220;And not a moment to soon,&#8221; he groans, before coughing up a ball of string. Alarms and klaxons start with flashing lights throughout the satellite. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;No time to clean up, guys!&#8221; Paulo shouts, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got FANFIC SIGN!!&#8221;
<br />
<br />End of Part One

<br />MYSTERY FL THEATER 3000
<br />
<br />EPISODE 1: &#8220;FREELANCER 2&#8221; 
<br />
<br />(A Freelancer/Dragonball/Terrence? Crossover MSTing) 
<br />By Sybot
<br />
<br />Part 2
<br />
<br />6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&#8230;
<br />
<br />*They enter the theatre and sit down in this order: King, Paulo, Trent, and Juni*
<br />
<br />King: Feeling better Trent?
<br />Trent: I think so&#8230;amazing how much good a scene change can do&#8230;Anyway. Recap guys!
<br />Paulo: The Nomads teamed up with some Saiya-jins and the Terrence Team, whatever the hell that is. Together they plotted to destroy the Sirius Sector by&#8230;attacking only New York.
<br />Juni: The Order was bored, so they went and investigated. They bumped into the bad guys and something incomprehensible happened. Trent then got a briefing from Orillion, and his clone Oriilion.
<br />King: Trent got an artifact that din't serve any purpose to the plot, and then there were a bunch of fights with no clear plotline to link them.
<br />Trent: (TV Announcer) And now&#8230;THE CONCLUSION!
<br />
<br />*The fic begins to scroll by on the theatre screen*
<br />
<br />&gt;6: Sleep While Enimies Blow Your Ship Off
<br />
<br />King: &#8230;
<br />Juni: *holding katana menacingly* Not a word&#8230;
<br />King: I&#8217;ll be quiet.
<br />
<br />&gt;7: Distroy The Red Bomber
<br />&gt;Mission 3:
<br />&gt;Anoter Mission To Distroy a Fleet So Orillion Knows This is The End 
<br />
<br />Trent: This fic will be The End of us!
<br />
<br />&gt;so He Will Help, Then Trent Goes Out Side 
<br />
<br />Juni: But he forgot his spacesuit, so he dies from the vacuum&#8230;
<br />Trent: So what&#8217;s on TV tonight? 
<br />
<br />&gt;and then almost gets blasted 16 times by a nomad and then some one comes out 
<br />&gt;from nowhere then kicks him 
<br />
<br />Paulo: Arghh! But Nomads don&#8217;t have legs!!! ArrrrRRRR! *Paulo&#8217;s head explodes in a flash of pyrotechnics* 
<br />Others: Err&#8230;
<br />King: Wonder if Megane 6.7 will sue for that?
<br />*Sound of fourth wall breaking, again*
<br />Paulo: *comes back up, head intact* Never mind.
<br />Trent: Glad the obligatory MSTing in-joke&#8217;s out of the way.
<br />
<br />&gt;in the sky then ran up to him but then trent smacks him 
<br />
<br />King: (Trent) You naughty, naughty boy!
<br />
<br />&gt;back into the building then said NOT THIS TIME!!! Then sombody came and said 
<br />&gt;&quot;Zaker!&quot; Then Trent Was Electrocuted Again. 
<br />
<br />Trent: Damn these cheap hairdryers!
<br />
<br />&gt;the next thing he knows is getting woken up by a Nomad, The Leader Of the &gt;Terrence Team, 
<br />
<br />Juni: You know, this is the first fanfic I&#8217;ve read where I&#8217;ve had absolutely no idea what the HELL SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE! *Throws katana, but it just gets stuck in the screen*
<br />
<br />&gt;and the Strongest Saiyan, Goku. Then Trent Said What The??!?! A Nomad?? a &gt;Saiyan?? a Terrence??? 
<br />
<br />Trent: Oh, great job Juni. You caused the sentences to get cut up.
<br />
<br />&gt;then the Nomad said You Can call me Solo
<br />
<br />King: (Solo the Nomad) &#8216;Hands Solo&#8217; Heh.
<br />Juni: *glares*
<br />Trent: Cool! When you said parsec, did you mean distance or time?
<br />Paulo: Did you shoot first?
<br />
<br />&gt;then Terrence said that is my brothers name 
<br />
<br />Paulo: (TV Announcer) Terrence and the Nomad brothers that scorned him, tonight on Jerry Springer!
<br />Juni: So Terrence is brother to a Nomad? Finally some hints to what he looks like!
<br />
<br />&gt;then Trent said so your here to help right? 
<br />
<br />King: (Terrence) Yes, even though we&#8217;ve been shooting each other since this story started. 
<br />
<br />&gt;then they said yes then Trent said why does the weird stuff always happen to me... 
<br />&gt;then the Nomad Solo said I have a plan to get passed the rest of the Nomads but it is 
<br />&gt;Tricky
<br />
<br />Trent: Nixon&#8217;s here?
<br />
<br />&gt;Objective 1: Launch to space
<br />&gt;The Nomad Leader said &quot;this is Nomad Alpha 16 to Nomad Beta 4 is your mission 
<br />&gt;compleate&quot; 
<br />
<br />King: If he&#8217;s the leader, how come he has such a crappy designation?
<br />Juni: Union deal.
<br />
<br />&gt;then the Nomad Solo said &quot;Yes Edision Trent has been controled&quot; 
<br />
<br />Trent: No-one controls me!
<br />King: (Number Six) I am not a number! I am a free man!
<br />
<br />&gt;then Nomad Leader said &quot;ok you are Cleared to dock&quot; Then Every one Starts &gt;Shooting Every Body Else 
<br />
<br />Paulo: What, for docking?
<br />King: I&#8217;d hate to see these guys when they get mad.
<br />
<br />&gt;exsept Goku and Terrence They use Ki energy &quot;WARNING WARNING 
<br />
<br />Juni: (Author) MY CAPSLOCK KEY IS STUCK!
<br />
<br />&gt;SECTOR BREACHED BRING REINFORCEMENTS THESE PEOPLE ARE 
<br />&gt;STRONG AND ARMED THEY ARE OURS WORKING WITH TRENT 
<br />&gt;WARNING WARNING&quot; Then Nomad Leader Said &quot;so you think you can 
<br />&gt;tri...augh&quot; 
<br />
<br />Trent: Sounds like a good name for a roller coaster. Tri-Augh!
<br />King: Triple the screams, triple the fun!
<br />
<br />&gt;Trent Said: JUNI!! KING!! ORILLION!!! 
<br />
<br />Juni: TESTSUOOOOOO!
<br />Trent: KANEDAAAAAA!!!!!
<br />Paulo: LEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEEEENKINS!!!!!!!!!!!
<br />
<br />&gt;What are you doing here? then Juni said &quot;We didn't see you for so long that we went 
<br />&gt;in space our selfs 
<br />
<br />Juni: That&#8217;s not a realistic portrayal&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t come looking for you. *Smiles sweetly*
<br />Trent: (sarcastic) Thanks&#8230;
<br />King: Same here. *Smiles sweetly*
<br />Trent: 0_o
<br />
<br />&gt;then we saw a Nomad Bomber Base that Decloaked like it was offline and distroyed 
<br />
<br />Paulo: *rubs his head* But if it was destroyed, how did you see it&#8230;
<br />Trent: *thwacks Paulo* Stop that! Remember the First Commandment. Thou shalt not repeat MSTing clich&#233;s.
<br />
<br />&gt;then We Heard the Alarm then we knew you where in there But you Where with a 
<br />&gt;Nomad??&quot;
<br />
<br />King: (Trent) What is this? The third-degree?
<br />Juni: (Juni) Where were you with a Nomad at nine o&#8217;clock yesterday evening?
<br />
<br />&gt;then trent said &quot;yes this time someone just Zaped me again then they woke me up&quot; 
<br />&gt;then the Solo Nomad 
<br />
<br />Trent: (Trent) Oops, did I just wipe out your whole species except you? Sorry about that.
<br />
<br />&gt;said &quot;we can use this base as out own home base I can build a Cloaking device
<br />
<br />Paulo: And then&#8230;
<br />Trent: Is it over?
<br />King: No more text is appearing.
<br />Juni: We beat it!
<br />Trent: Lets get out of here!
<br />
<br />*They exit in reverse order*
<br />
<br />SATTELITE OF LOVE:
<br />
<br />&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; Trent says as he sits back down at the table. The room has been magically restored to its pre-Juni state.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, except for the hideous spelling and grammar, the fact that nobody knows what a Terrence is, the plot that stunk like rotten eggs, and it just stopped without any sort of conclusion!&#8221; Juni looks like she is about to explode again, causing the others to back away quickly. However, she catches herself and instead sighs and sulks off to somewhere off-camera.
<br />
<br />Paulo notices a light flashing on the table, and mentions it. &#8220;Looks like that Forrester guy is calling.&#8221; The wall behind them turns into a screen and the familiar face of Dr Forrester appears. He looks less than happy.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So you weren&#8217;t driven insane,&#8221; he pouts, &#8220;never mind, I have plenty more where that came from!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bring it on!&#8221; Trent stands up in front of the screen.
<br />
<br />Forrester sighs. &#8220;Insolent little&#8230;&#8221; he mutters, &#8220;push the button Frank&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Frank?&#8221; says King.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Frank!&#8221; Forrester yells at the empty lab behind him, &#8220;oh whatever&#8221; He pushes the button.
<br />
<br />FWOOSH
<br />
<br />Stinger:
<br />&gt;Then Trent Said What The??!?! A Nomad?? a Saiyan?? a Terrence???
<br />
<br />There you go. I will start on Episode Two after COTH Chapter Nine is finished (also giving me time to find another MSTable fic). Comments welcome.</div>

<br />That means I won't be able to write as much, so both my fanfics are going to take a lot longer between chapters. Sorry <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />(MST3K Love Theme)
<br />
<br />In the very distant future,
<br />About 3000 AD
<br />There was this guy named Trent
<br />Not too different from you or me
<br />
<br />He worked for nobody but himself
<br />Caring for little else but his wealth
<br />He did a great job flying round the place,
<br />But his some villains didn&#8217;t like him
<br />So they shot him into space!!!!
<br />
<br />(Trent: But I was in space already!) 
<br />
<br />We'll send him crappy fanfics
<br />The worst we can find  (lalala)
<br />He'll have to sit and read them all and we'll monitor his mind  (lalala)
<br />
<br />Now keep in mind Trent can't control
<br />When the fanfics begin or end  (lalala)
<br />Because he used those special parts
<br />To teleport in his friends;
<br />
<br />GOOD GUY ROLL CALL:
<br />
<br />CAMBOT!
<br />(Smile please!) 
<br />
<br />PAULO!
<br />(Trent? Who&#8217;s that?)
<br />
<br />JUNI!
<br />(I *won&#8217;t* kill him for this)
<br />
<br />KIIIIIIIIIIING!!!
<br />(I need a drink&#8230<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />If you&#8217;re wondering how Trent eats and breathes
<br />And other science facts  (lalala)
<br />Then repeat to yourself
<br />It's just a MST
<br />You should really just relax
<br />for MYSTERY FL THEATER 3000!!!!
<br />
<br />SOL BRIDGE 
<br />
<br />Trent enters from the right. A door is on the wall behind him that wasn&#8217;t there last episode. He face Cambot to address the audience.
<br />
<br />&#8221;Hey there, I&#8217;m Trent, welcome to the Satellite of Love. The others are using a new feature we just discovered. Its proving useful for relieving stress after yet another of Forrester&#8217;s experiments. I could show you&#8230;&#8221; He turns and opens the door, and then enters, with Cambot right behind.
<br />
<br />HOLOCABANA
<br />
<br />Suddenly Trent is in a bar filled with scruffy miners. The whole place has a run-down and grimy feel. Outside the windows a bleak brown landscape can be seen. King is sitting with a group of miners round a table, with many mugs of Liberty Ale on it. He notices Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Want that drink I owe ya!&#8221; he yells across the bar. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Maybe later,&#8221; Trent replies. Looking back at Cambot, he continues. &#8220;Just like King&#8230;. Anyway we&#8217;ve been allowed to program any situation we want, which Juni has taken full advantage of.&#8221; He goes to one of the doors leading out of the bar and opens it. Cambot follows him through the door.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Please, no more!&#8221; The desperate cries of a man can be heard from down a long hall that looks suspiciously like the countdown hallway from the SOL. As they move down the corridor, the screams get louder until they suddenly find themselves in the SOL theatre. Juni is standing on the back of a row of seats, pointing a katana at the back of a man who looks suspiciously like Dr Forrester, except with a red lab coat and red rimmed glasses. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything you want!&#8221; he screams.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just keep watching, this is a fun part,&#8221; Juni cackles. Cambot looks up at the screen, which is playing a movie. On it is a very familiar scruffy man with huge knees. Torgo! Cambot panics at the sight and suddenly we have lost sight of the theatre as it tries to escape the horror. Our view shakes around suddenly as Cambot is forced back into the theatre by Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Freeze program!&#8221; he calls out, and the movie and Alternate Forrester stop moving. Juni takes a few seconds to notice, and when she does she turns around and looks at Trent with a disappointed frown on her face.
<br />
<br />&#8220;But I was having so much fun,&#8221; she whines, &#8220;that scum deserves it.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, but Manos? That has to qualify as cruel and unusual punishment!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to find someone else to take my anger out on,&#8221; she grins with an evil smile. She begins to swing her katana back, as if to throw it. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you be!&#8221; Trent yelps, diving through the nearest door. The katana clatters to the floor after passing just inches behind him. Cambot briefly looks at the screen, where Torgo is stuck in mid-shamble and then quickly chases after Trent. Suddenly we are in the cockpit of a spacecraft. Outside the window a battle is being fought. Ships are flying in every direction, too fast for Trent to see what they are. However he can make out a Battleship and Jumpgate.
<br />
<br />Suddenly the person in the pilots seat speaks up. &#8220;You&#8217;re not getting away with&#8230;&#8221; Paulo begins, but he is cut off by an incoming transmission.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey, nice try, but the PD is here to stop you. You don&#8217;t stand a chance&#8221; A Hispanic voice Trent didn&#8217;t recognise replies. Paulo is about to respond when Trent comes up behind his seat and taps him on the shoulder.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Gah! Don&#8217;t sneak up on me like that!&#8221; he shouts, leaping out of his seat as the hologram begins to dissolve. &#8220;Its not like I was playing out the final chapter of COTH or anything!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Eh?&#8221; Trent looks at Paulo with a confused expression.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; Paulo quickly changes the subject, &#8220;hey, is that a Commercial Sign?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />**COMMERCIAL**
<br />Need weapons?
<br />Your rivals getting too powerful?
<br />Don&#8217;t worry!
<br />The Potential Divider is here to help!
<br />Leave a message detailing what you need at any of the major House worlds.
<br />Address to M. c/o PD
<br />We look forward to doing business.
<br />**END COMMERCIAL**
<br />
<br />SOL BRIDGE
<br />
<br />Back on the bridge of the SOL, the group is gathered around a strange metal box with the words &#8216;Insert line here&#8217; inscribed on the side above a keyboard.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Think he&#8217;ll like it?&#8221; Paulo asks, prodding a few of the internal circuits.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Does it matter?&#8221; Trent retorts, &#8220;if this works it&#8217;ll make our lives a whole lot easier&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hang on,&#8221; interjects King, &#8220;Doctor Vornoff&#8217;s calling&#8221; He hits the flashing red button and the wall behind them becomes a screen. Dr Forrester&#8217;s familiar visage appears, grinning with madness as usual.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I hope you futurities have a nice invention lined up for our exchange. I find it interesting to know what advances have happened since I got stuck in the freezer all those centuries ago,&#8221; he says. He moves to reveal a metal box that looks like a scaled up version of Trent&#8217;s invention, except with the words &#8216;Insert qualities here&#8217; above the keyboard. &#8220;You first&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very well, Forrester,&#8221; Trent replies. He presses a button on the machine and it lights up. &#8220;This is a simple auto-riff machine. Just insert the line here&#8230;&#8221; He reaches round and types out &#8216;P.a.r.t O.n.e,. G.e.t.t.i.n.g. B.l.o.w.e.n. O.f.f. B.y. N.o.m.a.d.s.&#8217;. A hologram bursts out from the top of the machine and quickly forms into the image of a gold robot with a long beak.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sounds fun!&#8221; the robot says in oddly enunciated English. Suddenly the image changes to a man in his late twenties/early thirties.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Crow!&#8221; he says in the same odd tone as the robot did. The hologram fades and Trent turns back to Forrester.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Like it?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Of course not! This will make your lives a whole lot easier. I already conceded the Holocabana, I&#8217;m not going to give another inch!&#8221; Forrester growls in return. He stabs a button off screen and the auto-riffer disappears in a flash of cool CGI. Moments later it appears on the floor next to Forrester&#8217;s invention. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine, what&#8217;s your box do?&#8221; King asks, annoyed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Much more than yours!&#8221; Forrester cackles. He sidles over to his machine and types out words like &#8216;sycophantic&#8217;, &#8216;slightly dumb&#8217;, and &#8216;sturdy body&#8217;. &#8220;I give you, the ultimate sidekick creator!&#8221; He pulls the lever while laughing like a madman. There is a flash of light and a cloud of smoke. &#8220;Hahahahahahack-hack-cough-cough&#8230;anyway.&#8221; Forrester waves the smoke away. &#8220;Presenting my brand new resurrected sidekick&#8230;TV&#8217;s Fr&#8230;Monkey!?&#8221; Emerging from the smoke is a furry ape-like creature wearing glasses. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Excuse me, where am I?&#8221; the monkey creature mumbles. It glances at the still stunned Forrester and its eyes open in surprise, &#8220;you look familiar. Are you perhaps related to the Lawgiver?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Back in the box banana-brain,&#8221; Forrester replies with rage after finally coming to his senses. A swift kick sends the monkey back into the machine. There is another flash of light and out of the smoke steps a familiar sight. The slightly podgy and ever-popular TV&#8217;s Frank! Forrester&#8217;s eyes light up. &#8220;Frank! I thought I&#8217;d never see you again!&#8221; He runs up to Frank and gives him a huge hug. Frank naturally looks surprised at this turn of events.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I never knew you felt that way Steve&#8230;&#8221; At those words Forrester&#8217;s eyes and face darken. He pulls out of the hug and delivers a massive uppercut that knocks Frank off-screen.
<br />
<br />&#8220;While Frank and I get &#8216;reacquainted&#8217;, here&#8217;s the next experiment, with a twist that I&#8217;m sure will send you weeping for you mothers,&#8221; Forrester says, quickly hitting the send button on his console before stalking off-screen towards Frank, wielding an axe that had appeared from nowhere.
<br />
<br />&#8220;A twist?&#8221; Juni muses as the screen turns back into the wall.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Never mind that!&#8221; yells Trent as general mayhem descends on the SOL, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got Fanfic Sign!!!&#8221;
<br />
<br />6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1&#8230;
<br />
<br />*They enter the theatre and sit down in this order: King, Paulo, Trent, and Juni*
<br />
<br />Juni: This better be a good twist!
<br />Trent: Calm down, it can&#8217;t be that bad.
<br />Paulo: Yeah, it can&#8217;t be as bad as &#8216;The alien invader&#8217;s one weakness is water&#8217;.
<br />Juni: (Ominous) We&#8217;ll see&#8230;
<br /> 
<br />*The fic begins to scroll by on the theatre screen*
<br />
<br />&gt;The Final Farewell
<br />
<br />All: Bye, bye sanity!
<br />
<br />&gt;This is my first attempt at something other than humor, so please be nice.
<br />
<br />Juni: (evil) Oh, we&#8217;ll be &#8216;nice&#8217; hehehehe.
<br />
<br />&gt;Disclaimer: Q, Picard and sickbay do not belong to me.
<br />
<br />Trent: (Author) But the rest of Star Trek does. Now gimme royalties!
<br />
<br />&gt;In a flash of light, 
<br />
<br />King: He has a light bulb under his clothes?
<br />Trent: Yuck! 
<br />
<br />&gt;Q appeared in a near empty room and gazed down at sickbay's only occupant.
<br />
<br />King: An Enterprise console operator?
<br />Paulo: Siler?
<br />Juni: Trent?
<br />Trent: Eep. 
<br />
<br />&gt;Captain Jean-Luc Picard was hooked up to more machines that anyone would like to &gt;count. He had been in a terrible accident. 
<br />
<br />Paulo: Someone had switched his tea for something other than Earl Grey, hot.
<br />
<br />&gt;Everyone knew this was the end of their captain.
<br />
<br />Juni: Which end? His feet?
<br />King: I prefer the head. *eyes glaze over* So shiny&#8230;
<br />
<br />&gt;Q had considered saving him, but soon realized that doing it again would only be &gt;prolonging the inevitable.
<br />
<br />Trent: (Emo) Everyone dies eventually, why save anybody?
<br />King: (Emo) I keep going across the street, why doesn&#8217;t it work!
<br />Juni: Stupid emo, its down the road, like so&#8230; *takes out katana*
<br />Trent: Ahhh! A riff too far! *just avoids his wrists getting chopped off*
<br />
<br />&gt;He heard footsteps. 
<br />&gt;Q leaned down and quickly kissed the starship captain's lips. 
<br />
<br />All: 0_o 
<br />Paulo: I don&#8217;t like where this is going&#8230;
<br />
<br />&gt;&quot;Farewell, my love&quot; he whispered.
<br />
<br />Trent, Paulo and Juni: Gyahhhhhhhhh!!!!!
<br />*They collapse*
<br />King: What? I always thought it was pretty obvious.
<br />
<br />&gt;And in another flash of light, Q was gone.
<br />
<br />King: I think its over now.
<br />Trent: *Getting up off the floor* Short but incredibly unsweet, Forrester. Can we go now? 
<br />Dr F: (Over PA) Not just yet, boobies, now it&#8217;s the main course, a neat little &#8216;kawaii&#8217; fic entitled &#8216;When Ani gets Sick&#8217;.
<br />Juni: Kill me now&#8230; 
<br />
<br />End of Part One
<br />
<br />Part Two will be a while whilst I work on riffs for 'When Ani gets sick'. Until then, keeping circulating the tapes.</div>

			<div class="content">I'm sad to see this go, but I feel I burnt myself out idea-wise in the first episode. Writing original comedy is not something I'm good at, and therefore I am stopping work on this fanfic.
<br />
<br />Fear not though, as COTH will continue, as well as other projects:

<br />
<br />Epilogue:
<br />
<br />Juni stabs Forrester with her katana and they all teleport away to live happily ever after. (except Trent, who ends up marrying Juni and getting beat upon for the rest of his life)

<br />The End
