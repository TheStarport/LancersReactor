			<div class="content">After seeing <a href='http://www.giga.de/index.php?storyid=127805' Target=_Blank> this story </a> (beware: in German) about a 7-year-old 'Halo'-pro-gamer  <a href='http://www.lilpoison.com/' Target=_Blank> (his homepage in English) </a> I was asking myself at what age children start &quot;gaming&quot; (definition: playing with computer/console related games).
<br />
<br />When I was a child there were obviously no such games - you might call it 'middle age', shorly after the last crusade <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> . At that time the discussion was about at what age children should be allowed to watch TV.
<br />My son started gaming (some Pokemon/Mario/Zelda-stuff on N64) when he was about 10. He did not have a Game-boy (we did not want it) and - I think he has learned to play with computer games in a non-addictive way (unlike his father <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> D<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />When did you start ? And at what age did/would you allow your (actual or future) kids to start gaming ?</div>

			<div class="content">i dont think that there is a *suitable age* to start gaming as such, rather appropriate ages for certain game content and types of games. Myself I first played computer games in the mid-to-late 70s at around 12 or 13, such as calculator games and Pong on an early comsole, and in amusement arcades; Space Invaders, Galaxian, Gorf, Missile Command and the like. Now that was a lot more worrying than anything regarding game content back in those days, because naturally I fell into bad company in the arcades which were in those days extensions of pool halls, etc.
<br />
<br />My son started playing computer games when he was about 4, but these were interactive learning games, and from then on he's gradually moved up the gaming evolutionary ladder (he's 11) through Pokemon, Starfox, Sonic, Worms and the like until now he has learnt to be more selective about his gaming choices. He's currently playing Far Cry and modding some other game, don't know what, he won't tell me. He still plays some of his kiddie games on the sly, esp that dratted Nintendogz, but he's most insistent that now he plays proper growed-up games too. And he finished HL2 before me!
<br />
<br />if anything I'd say it's never too soon to start as computer games are a marvellous learning tool, even for older kids. I dare say a lot of teens contributing here on TLR learnt more about WW2 history by playing MoH and CoD than they ever did in school! And the interactivity for little ones can be delightful, kids love stuff that does stuff, believe me, Jump Ahead and Land before Time were required material in our house a few years ago.</div>

			<div class="content">Your son is 11 now - and he plays FarCry? and HL2 ? 
<br />I am surprised. Honestly i think that some of the shock-effects in those games are too much for Kids (and an 11-year-old still IS). 
<br />Of course after some thrills and fears he get used to it. But is this desireable? 
<br />
<br />Perhaps I am conservative on that point but I think that games like FC/HL2/Doom 3/Fear are for the 14+. 
<br />
<br />(I hope you take it as an opinion; i don't want to critizise your way of educating)</div>

			<div class="content">@zeds; I know you said that ths was a question of when such games as opposed to movies was appropriate but the principle remains the same. Although not yet a parent I can imagine that I would put an age limit that the kids must reach before being allowed to view certain content. That is however largely due to the fact that Mrs Id would put her foot down and I ain't gonna argue, or so I reckon.<img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />In my case however some of the first movies I can actually recall were Dirty Harry and The Shining. Of course, I do recall queing up to see the equally violent 12's rated Star Wars, as we now know it Episode IV, the first one,<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. My point is that I was fed a healthy ration of 18's rated flicks from a very young age by my now to be eternally damned for poor parenting folks. Did me no harm what so ever. No little neighbourhood dogs tortured, no bullying in school, no late night attacks on young girls, just bloodsucking capitalistic vampirism.
<br />
<br />The balance of input is what is important. Everything in moderation. I grew up with caring parents, with open discussion in the house where maturity was encouraged (that part was missed on me). I also watched and read films and books with softer and philosophical content. This meant that I was not overdosing on a diet of violence and was not starved of the ability to think for myself.
<br />
<br />A cartoon I once saw:
<br />
<br />Picture of 2 children playing behind a sofa. Legs of 2 mothers standing beside.
<br />
<br />Mother A to B: &quot;I just cannot believe you gave Johnny a toy gun to play with. I would not give my young Bobby a toy which encourages war and violence I try to take a more constructive and educational attitude to play.&quot;
<br />
<br />In the picture the children are playing with Lego set, one named Bobby has built a gun and is firing at his mother, Johnny is using his gun as a hammer to aid his construction of a Lego house.</div>

<br />@ Druid: no objection, sir. I understand and agree to the point where you can discuss on gaming aspects <i> rationally  </i>.
<br />Example: I allowed my son to play C'n'C-Generals and Zero Hour, but after we had discussed about 'terrorists' or the 'funny' animations of soldiers and people burning in the fire. HERE you can help understanding.
<br />
<br />But in the very moment Headcrabs or the screaming fast zombies attack in Ravenholm or when the mutant Trigens go after you in FC these moments are very <i> emotional  </i> . Your reactions there are far from rational. I still get chills even in the 5th run or so.

			<div class="content">Having a 2.75 year-old, I am very concerned about this question.  Needless to say, there are two opinions in my house.  The right one (wifey's) and mine.  So far, wifey is of the opinion that never is too soon but that's just something I have to work on.
<br />
<br />Actually, I have some reservations about letting the Munchkin play on the computer before she gets older.  I was thinking 5 but I don't have a sense of where her fine motor skills will be and I think that's one of the more critical issues.  Once she has better hand and eye coordination, I think she'd be ready to play on a PC.  I am thinking about what to get for her, whether a hand me down of mine is rugged and safe enough, etc.
<br />
<br />I think what is or isn't appropriate depends upon the child.  Right now, for instance, my daughter tends to have bad dreams if she watches tv too close to bed time and what she watches includes scenes that have a negative impact.  For example, she loves Thomas the Tank Engine.  But if she watches a story in which there is a derailment or a crash of some kind, it tends to cause her to wake up in the middle of the night.  How do I know?  Regrettable repetitions of sleepless nights in which patterns slowly emerged.
<br />
<br />So.  As far as I know, and certainly at her present tenderest of ages, most games that involve destruction, injury, demolition and the like are not appropriate for her.  Beyond that ... there are behaviors that I'd rather not have her see and find amusing.  For example, one of my outlaws sent us a combination gift, a stuffed teddy bear and a video.  The bear is one of these &quot;Care Bear&quot; ones and the video was a &quot;Care Bears&quot; video.  Innocuous enough, you would think, but the story on the video involves a &quot;bad&quot; character named &quot;Screechy.&quot;  This character's hallmark is that she screams so loud, glass shatters and buildings crumble.  Guess which character my daughter likes to emulate the most?  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />
<br />@indy; I should stop agreeing with you, it is starting to feel uncomfortable.<img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I am sure that like many (though not all) aspects of parenting there is no hard and fast rule and the character of both parent and child will vary hence the age and content of introduction would vary.
<br />
<br />The idea of making a child comfortable with touching and being around a comp at an early age, even before actual use of the machine is really possible, makes sense as they are less likely to be intimidated by the technology later on.
<br />
<br />I agree totally with what most of you are saying which is that although some material is allowable and use of the technology per say is okay the content does have to be censored taking into consideration the intellectual and emotional development of the child.

			<div class="content">Every child is different. You can't set an age at which it is acceptable for everyone because no two children are exactly alike.
<br />
<br />Case in point- both my sister and myself were reading by the age of three. By the time our friends had picked up the skill, we had already moved on and were reading full-length novels. We also began playing games around the same time- and we understood fully that there was no connection between the events on that screen and real life. 
<br />
<br />To be fair, I've met people my age (19) who still don't grasp that concept, which I picked up in the late 80s. There is no singular standard which could be fairly applied to everyone in every situation. The decision of when games (and what kind of games) are appropriate to play is the sole responsibility of the parents, and should never be handed off to anyone but.

			<div class="content">But Zz's linkies raise another question as well.  Those 7 year-olds are &quot;professional&quot; game players.
<br />
<br />It doesn't have to be video games, it could be anything else, athletics, singing and dancing, what have you.
<br />
<br />Are these child prodigies?  If so, they need very special nurturing and parenting.  Are they getting it?
<br />
<br />I don't think it is appropriate for a child to be a professional anything.  Not from the standpoint of earning money as much as from the standpoint of the pressures, priorities and stress associated with earning money.

			<div class="content">I played my first games at age 111 or 12 I think when we first got a PC, strangely enough that was the first thing I ever did on a pc, playing games, Privaterr the Darkening and Wing Commander iv. 
<br />Oh now that I think about it, we actually played games in school on the computers, I guess from about age 8 or so. All educatiuonal games.
<br />
<br />I'd say it's never to early to start, with the correct games offcourse. I found that some some games are excellent for a lot of things, from knowledge aquired, to faster reflections, bettering hand eye co-ordination etc. 
<br />
<br />Then also, most, if not all serious gamers I know have above average IQ's. I guess if I ever have kids I'd try to get them started on games as early as possible, carefully chosing the games off course

<br />Classic! Well I suppose it has always been my place in life to be the excetptional one.
<br />
<br />@Indy; So not only does it question when someone should play p.c./console games but also when they are actually ready to take on the burden of money and all of it's evils,...cheap cars, hard women and fast drugs? What age was that deaf kid again when he wrote all those narly piano tunes, 5ish, and the Alex lad when he went off gallivanting with his mates all about place?
<br />
<br />The evidence of negative impact in later years on kids who have career success is pretty clear in our young movie stars. River Phoenix, Judy Garland, Corey Haim, Gary Coleman and more tragically Dana Plato, nearly Drew Barrymore (Drew Barrymore hmmm <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>), and of course George W. Okay you can say that with money and stardom come problems for adults too but the odds are firmly stacked against child stars actually getting through the ordeal unscathed. Of course, professional and cash rich star are not the same but the principle is the same. Children ae not equipped emotionally for professional life and rightly so. They are usually left broken victims to over zealous parents and unscrupulous managers. A scaled down level of success will have scaled down abuse.
<br />
<br />I am all on for letting childhood last as long as you can allow it, I hope mine never ends.</div>
