			<div class="content">Sitting behind his desk, a hologram formed of a hooded female. A dark presence could even be felt here. He reported all the questions that were asked of him, assuring her that he gave no answers. He explained the stall he was trying to get in the Senate, so the bill to grant powers could be restored, but the Jedi where seemingly on to it. The figure made a gesture, and Arcon reached for his throat. Trying to speak, to plead for his life. But to no avail. Gasping, fighting for breath, till darkness began to fall over him. When his secretary checked in on him before retiring for the night, she received the shock of finding him dead. No evidence of a break in. No one was there, but she felt like she was being watched. She did summon the Jedi to investigate though. 
<br />
<br />An apprentice padawan and a Jedi Master were the first to arrive. They examined the room for any evidence and the body and then, feeling a presence, closed their eyes. As if to search the room again, by the force. They found a dark residue. It was surrounding the body of the Chancellor. It was as if he died a violent death, but no tracks had been left in the room. Yet, a presence remained there. They also checked the communication records. There was only one transmission, but tracing it would take some time. They made arrangements for the disposition of the body and relayed the information to the Jedi Counsel and to the Senate. They were not scheduled for a few days, before they would be reconvened.
<br />
<br />This was disturbing as it closed an avenue of information, that might have exposed the plot the Dark Master had in place. They resigned them selves to continue the investigation. They needed information, and, soon. The Bothans had sent a second pair to the Yavin system, but rather than using civilian transport, they used an Imperial shuttle in prime condition. This might help the gathering somewhat. All security codes that could be found were given them. The council would now have to wait, to know. Hoping the darkness would not fall.
<br />
<br />The roots kept out all light. But as with the other visitor, none was needed. Darkstone deftly made his way to the bottom. He too felt the dark aura of the force, but, it was different, as if drained. But how could it be drained away. All things were apart of the force, flowing in and through them. How could it be tapped and drawn away. Had Carla learned that the first time she was here? A puzzle to ask his father when he returned to the surface. But, now was his trial he had to face, his anger....
<br />
<br />He continued forward. Deeper and deeper into the darkness. It surrounded him and clung to him like a leech. It seemed to seek the power with in him. He resisted, meditating as he proceeded. He was not here to fight an enemy, but himself. He had to conquer his inner anger at the killer. If he did not, he would never be able to destroy th Dark Master. He had to be ready to meet her. He remembered what his father had taught him about his grand father. Anakin, was a powerful Jedi, yet he fell to the dark side, but, in the end, the good in him overcame the evil. It took Luke, willing to save his father, to get him back from the dark side. He must turn the fire within towards the darkside, to defeat it. 
<br />
<br />The Admiral was headed back to his ship. His second in command in tow. The Captain was the son of Admiral Thrawn. But, he was less sure of his abilities than the Admiral was. Captain Eraser was eager to prove himself. He had after all, dispensed with the former Captain of his Remnant ship. And that, was no easy task. This was a plus in his favor with the Admiral. That and who his father had been. But, he was loyal to the Admiral, without question. Together, they would crush the Republic fleet. They, would plan a difficult offensive, that no one would anticipate.
<br />
<br />Jagged was ready for their arrival. He had all in order, and was at battle stations when they arrived. He was not likely to live through another failure. When the Admiral sent the orders to the bridge, he relayed the command to depart from Yavin and set course to the nearest star system. Twelve ships in all, jumped to hyperspace and were gone. No one noticed the shuttle as it to went to hyperspace, on a different course. 
<br />
<br />It was not noticed that it had traveled around the installation, and near the Death Star. No one even noticed the scan being taken of all the fleet that had just jumped. That, was a failure, that would cost this new fleet, and some ones head. Well, almost no one noticed. Darth Neo_kuja was in the tower, preparing it for his masters arrival, when he felt a disturbance in the force. He saw the shuttle, watched as it stopped and scanned ships, watched as it jumped to hyper space. He would report this failure to his Master. 
<br />
<br />Indy had all of his men working twelve hour shifts. Work must be finished by the end of the week. The Dark Lord was due then to take command of the Death Star and to begin it&#8217;s journey into history of the new Empire. sw wanted all ready for her ascension as the new Emperor of the Republic. One that would be ruled with an iron fist and a light saber. The dark curtain would truly fall then, enveloping all. The Sith, would rise to power once more!
<br />
<br />He was on the bridge when the door slid back. The darkness felt before seen. Darth Neo_kuja moved onto the deck, heading towards the com panel. He keyed up the channel he wanted and engaged the hologram controls. His master stood on the deck and he kneeled before the image. Then he gave the report of the ship siting to the Dark Master. She did not look pleased. But issued commands that Neo_kuja would relay. And then the hologram dissolved. Fear was on Indy&#8217;s face as the Sith left the bridge. Fear at what he had over heard. Fear, at what the Dark Lord would do to him....
<br />
<br />Freighter fighter had what he wanted, his pay. The weapons were on their way and he was glad to be rid of Geonosis. Too much dirt and bugs for his taste. He longed for and was headed towards population. Coruscant would do for a start, but he would head to look for work on Nar Shaddaa. There would be work there for a weapons expert. He would look up Locutus. That man always had work for you to do and payed well to boot. Changing his mind, he changed course for Nar Shaddaa.. It would be only an hour, then he would find work to keep him busy until needed again.
<br />
<br />Mustang was beginning to grow tired of a water world, but with his ship locked down, he had little to do. He made arrangements to &#8216;borrow&#8217; a couple of the clones to hone his skills with. They battled on the storms on the top of the city. The fighting fierce as he was fighting himself. He nearly lost his footing twice and headed for the drink. His utility packs were drained in this encounter. He had to settle for a draw in this encounter. The cloners were doing too good of a job this time.  He just hoped he never had to face the clones against him in battle. It might not go well for him. 
<br />
<br />His wrist com signaled that Lama Su wished and audience with him as soon as possible. More poking and prodding. He hated this with passion. But, he was well paid and would enjoy it, if he ever got to leave the city. Damn rain ruined any thing he wanted to do. He was resolved, after this meeting, to free his ship and leave with the money paid so far. 
<br />
<br />Lama Su motioned him to the chair descending from the ceiling. He sat while Lama Su sat as well. Too damn formal, all the time. But, to business. &#8220;I need out of here&#8221; Mustang spoke. He shifted in his seat. Wanting to be out of this place.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That, I am afraid I can not permit at this time&#8221; Lama Su began, apologizing in the process, &#8220;But we need more samples for the next batch to be created&#8221;. To mustang, he was clearly placating him and that meant being stuck here longer. Something he would not tolerate anymore.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then talk to the one that pays me and get their permission to let me out of here&#8221; Mustang, agitation rising now. He wanted nothing more than to just walk out now, but he had to choose his time.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Jedi Master, has indicated that you will remain here as long as clones are needed&#8221; Lama Su spoke. His voice irritating Mustang as well. There was no violence, no anger in it, just a statement.
<br />
<br />Mustang slammed fist a down on his knee and rose to leave. &#8220;Then you&#8217;re not getting any more genetic material, until I&#8217;m allowed to leave&#8221;. He stormed out and back to his quarters. He had to get out now. He had the equipment to get his ship released, all it took was time. He packed a backpack with the gear, strapped on his pair of blasters and left his quarters. But he now had a little problem in getting away as troopers were marching on the outer flight deck towards his ship. Now, his escape route was cut off, and any chances to get away with it. Still, he would enjoy the hunt that was now presented to him and drew his blasters. His discipline might prove the edge he needed to get to his ship. Once there, he would have no problem at all. 
<br />
<br />Darth Neo_Kuja was headed back to the bridge of the Death Star. He simply wanted his presence known that he was still here and that work must be stepped up more.  The door slid aside on the turbo lift. Indy scarcely glanced up, then did a double take and snapped to attention. His Commander on deck, surprised everyone present. But they wasted no time in returning the salute once they saw who it was. Fear spread outward. An evil smile formed on the Sith&#8217;s face. Indy knew this would not be a good day, at all.

			<div class="content">Darth Neo_Kuja was headed back to the bridge of the Death Star. He simply wanted his presence known that he was still here and that work must be stepped up more.  The door slid aside on the turbo lift. Indy scarcely glanced up, then did a double take and snapped to attention. His &#8216;Commander on deck&#8217;, surprised everyone present. But they wasted no time in returning the salute once they saw who it was. Fear spread outward. An evil smile formed on the Sith&#8217;s face. Indy knew this would not be a good day, at all.
<br />
<br />Indy gave his report of their progress. The main generator was fully functional. The shielding was in place and activated. The surface weapons were fully functional. The troops were running exercises in preparation to a landing. The planetary shield was fully functional and secure. All ships in the system accounted for. Neo_Kuja snapped his head up at that. His eyes flashed a deep fire. He moved to the display panel and keyed up a playback he had made earlier. It showed a shuttle moving among the ships, stopping every so often and the resuming. It showed the same ship jumping out of the system. 
<br />
<br />Indy gulped when he saw the ship and quickly ran it&#8217;s registry. None was found for it. A republic ship? That was not possible. But, he knew the Dark one would already know of this and of the failure to terminate the ship and crew. But, Darth Neo_kuja simply turned and left the bridge. That would mean a later visit by the Master. Something he would not relish. E ordered the in crease of hours on a shift and requested more men and supplies. One failure, cost more work to be produced. He would be ready to counter some of the anger that would be sent his was, though, he thought, it was more the respociblity of the Admiral than his on securing the system. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone, his mission complete, gathered his things together and prepared to leave Degoba. As he loaded the last of his things, Luke appeared to him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the dark side draw you in son, don&#8217;t let your anger at my death destroy you&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />Darkstone dropped the last bag in his hand and turned to face the image. &#8220;What do you expect me to do, father&#8221; his response sparked, &#8220;You were just like me when you went to Bespin to rescue Han and Aunt Lea&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes I was, and look at what it cost me&#8221; the image of Luke holding out his hand. A mech one in the place of a real flesh and blood one. &#8220;And it cost my friends more pain and trouble as well&#8221;.
<br />
<br />Darkstone stooped and retrieved the bag and stowed it, &#8220;I know what I&#8217;m doing, I have to face her for what she did&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t know, something that will change all of it for you, something that will eat at you when you hear it&#8221; Luke said, sitting on a log. You know what is in the data banks, that Carla&#8217;s parent were killed and I and your mother raised her&#8221; Darkstone nodded and sat beside Luke. The tale turned interesting. The truth is, she&#8217;s Han and Lea&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Luke let that sink in for a moment.
<br />
<br />Darkstone could hardly believe what he was hearing. &#8220;But, their daughter died when she was less than a year old, while Han was away, that&#8217;s why he vowed to never leave Lea alone again&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s what Lea decided to tell Han and we hid the child for a year, then your mother and I agreed to raise her and train her to be a jedi, and never know the truth of her birth.&#8221; Luke spoke, he could not look Darkstone in the eye. Darkstone shook his head as Luke continued. &#8220;Carla never knew that, until just before she killed Lea and myself&#8221; Luke paused, &#8220;She was so angry at not knowing her parents were both alive, that her hate blinded her and rage took over and she killed us&#8221; Luke went on to explain that, that was the reason they never saw death coming for them.
<br />
<br />Darkstone struck the log with a fist. &#8220;Why did you never tell me, why did you let me believe a rouge Jedi killed you, and not my cousin&#8221;. Darkstone softened, &#8220;Does Han know, does he have any idea his daughter is still alive and now wants to rule the galaxy?&#8221; Luke shook his head. &#8220;Are you going to tell him the truth, father&#8221; Darkstone rose, anger again returning to his features. Luke again shook his head. &#8220;Then I will &#8220; he turned on his heals and headed for the X-Wing. R2 had it powered up and he put a foot on the ladder as Luke reached him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell him, not yet&#8221; Luke replied. Darkstone shook his head and climbed into the cockpit and shut the hatch. He fired up the thrusters and lifted off and set course into space. He now had a change of plans. He dictated a message for the Jedi Council and sent it then jumped into hyper space. His course was to Tatooine. He had also sent a message to Han just before jumping asking him to meet Darkstone there. They would have to talk before he resumed his mission. By then, the council would have reached a decision. 
<br />
<br />The Shuttle jumped out of hyper space and transmitted all the information to the Jedi Council and then jumped again to another system. They missed seeing the Star Destroyer by just seconds as it jumped in. They were following the shuttle, and jumped on the same course that the shuttle had and were gone.
<br />
<br />The council was in full meeting when they received both transmissions. Esquilax was the first to speak. &#8220;This information from Darkstone, sheds a whole new light on the problems we have before us, but the information the Bothans brought us, turns that light to darkness&#8221;.
<br />
<br />GowserPaul lifted a hand for the talk to cease. He expressed his concern over the information, but also pointed out, that by knowing, they could change the situation now. He said that with the news of a Death Star, it would change tactics and he would also immediately relay the information to the Republic fleet. They could plan strategies to deal with the situation while they handled the dark Lord and it&#8217;s situation.

			<div class="content">shouldn't she be wanting to become EMPRESS rather than Emperor?
<br />
<br />...but the Fleet is the lasting glory of the Imperium. The Imperial Navy with it's military values is the repository of all that was best and true of the Galactic Empire, order, tradition, duty, service, the rule of law, stability, firm and sensible government, and the communal wellbeing of all citizens, not a chaotic  and garsping indivudualism masquerading as &quot;democracy.&quot; Once this generation of Rebels has expired, the so-called New Republic will fall away into the hands of competing Senators and military commanders, all keen to establish their own poer. But the Empire endures; when the foolish Republic falls apart the Empire will be restored to it's rightful place and once again be supreme, and restore peace, order, and lawful govt to the Galaxy. And it's reach will be yet extended to the uttermost star...
<br />
<br />as Grand Admiral Thrawn intended.

			<div class="content">The council was in full meeting when they received both transmissions. Esquilax was the first to speak. &#8220;This information from Darkstone, sheds a whole new light on the problems we have before us, but the information the Bothans brought us, turns that light to darkness&#8221;.
<br />
<br />GowserPaul lifted a hand for the talk to cease. He expressed his concern over the information, but also pointed out, that by knowing, they could change the situation now. He said that with the news of a Death Star, it would change tactics and he would also immediately relay the information to the Republic fleet. They could plan strategies to deal with the situation while they handled the Dark Lord and it&#8217;s situation. 
<br />
<br />Admiral Bargib received the Jedi&#8221;s report of both the fleet and the news of the new Death Star. It would be a death blow to the republic, if the empire was revived. It was up to him to prevent that. He activated the holo projector to show the fleets and their positions. He called for a meeting with Captain Spix, Commander Major Striker, Lt Cmdr Ajim and Commander Kimk.  They all met in the war room of Home One. After the battle at Endor, it was never quite the same. 
<br />
<br />Captain Spix looked over the holodata that was being presented. The Imperial fleet was large, but not too big that they could not handle. There were enough fighter wings assembled that they could take on a few Capitol ships and hold their own. Lt Cmdr Ajim was the wing commander of Home Two and second the opinion that they were prepared. They would need only set a course and intercept the fleet, then they could deal with the death star. He was a good dog fighting tactician and won man battles against the remnant. Two of the wingmen now under his command, were Redstar one and Topher. They had just arrived from the battle they fought against a star destroyer. 
<br />
<br />The squadrons were composed of A-wings and B-Wings. They would provide cover fire and engage the Tie fighters. It would be up to Ajim to knock out as many shield generators as possible. That could turn the tide of battle fast. The six Nebulon-B Escort frigates would stand up to many of the imperial ships in a fight. But, they would rely mainly on the fighters to do most of the work, then fire the main guns to disable the ships with Ion fire. There were six republic carriers in this task force. They would hanger all the fighters needed. 
<br />
<br />It was not long before all ships were in formation and the order was given to jump into hyper space. Destination, Endor. 
<br />
<br />The Commander, Major Striker, was meeting with his ground troops. They would not have much of a role in this battle, but they would be prepared if the battle left the stars for the surface of a planet. They were among the best and most elite of soldiers the republic had. They had fought many battle s on worlds, eliminating the remnant from them and freeing the populations. This, was no different. And, no one could forget the battle that was fought on Endor. The inhabitants fo Endor had of great help and proved even small creatures could beat a bigger opponent in battle.
<br />
<br />The fleet was eighteen ships in strength and was ready for battle. Admiral Bargib had all plans set for dropping out of Hyper space. They would arrive just moments after the imperial fleet had dropped out as well. They would not be expected and that element of surprise would make, they hoped, this a short battle. The signal was given and all ships dropped out of Hyperspace.
<br />The order was given and all fighter wings engaged the imperial fleet. The Empire had only a few ships, not as many as was led to believe. A disappointment, but an easier victory. Two star Destroyers and two Frigates and twenty fighters. Redstar One ordered his men to engage the Star Destroyer while he went for the shield generators. With in a moment, the shields were down and they disengaged and headed towards the second Destroyer. Home One and Two opened fire on the first destroyer and the ion cannons disabled the ship. 
<br />
<br />A crewman alerted Bargib to a second group of ships about to drop out of Hyperspace. There were twelve in this group and one was a Super Star Destroyer. This was the part they had been expecting, but now they were a little out of position to defend themselves. Gold leader, Topher, ordered his men and two other wings to pull out of the fight and pull back to protect Home Two. The new ships were due to drop out in about fifteen minuets, not long, but then long enough for them to take out the other capital ships first. 
<br />
<br />Commander KimK ordered his batteries to open fire on the other Star Destroyer as it&#8217;s shields went down. That left two frigates left. They would be no match. The fighter wings, having destroyed all the tie&#8217;s regrouped and went after the frigates. They were cut to pieces. Just as Home One was regrouping, The other ships dropped out of Hyper space. The Super Star was too close. It opened fire on Home One. Kimk opened fire with all he had, but was too close to hit anything enough to do damage. He called for all his fighter support to return and defend the ship while he attempted to withdraw. It was futile, but he gave it all he had. Some starboard batteries on the Super Star were destroyed, but so was Home One. Kimk was on the bridge to the last. He relayed all information to the Admiral, even as he died, in a spectacular explosion.	
<br />
<br />The other wings began to take damage. But Redstar One and Topher gathered their ships and headed for the Super Star&#8217;s bridge They had to get the shields down. 
<br />
<br />Admiral Taw had anticipated this tactic and had two squadrons of Tie Defenders hold station near the bridge. The prey was coming to the hunter. He would have smiled, had he felt excitement any more, but his master, had taken that from him. He knew only obedience and would take the victory back to his master as a trophy. This would be the first of many victories he would win. 
<br />
<br />The republic ships began to dwindle, Home Two had taken damage and half the remaining ships were destroyed. Admiral Bargib ordered a withdraw and to jump into hyper space. Only three ships were able to jump. A crushing blow to the republic. They only managed to destroy six ships. Two Star destroyers, and four frigates. Not worth the exchange. They had less than half of the fighters left. Admiral Bargib hated to leave two ships behind, but their jump capabilities were gone, and to remain, would have meant complete defeat. 
<br />
<br />The republic withdrew to a safe system to regroup. They were not out of it yet. They just needed to gather the heavy hitters to jump back into it with. An Jump, they would!
<br />
<br />Darkstone dropped out of hyperspace just above Tatooine. The dry and arid planet was inhospitable at time, while other time, just like home. Darkstone spent a few year here while training. He hated the sand though. He had learned much here about survival. His father was thorough. Like himself had grown up here as well as did his grandfather. The Huts, well, they did not survive here past Jabba. When he died out on the due sea, the others decided to give this planet a wide berth. Climate since the rebirth of the republic, had changed for gangsters.
