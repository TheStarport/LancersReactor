			<div class="content">Get bent <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Haven't heard that in a while, thanks for the chuckle Default.  There has always only been one absolute and official rule on the Browclops server, and that is &quot;Keep it reasonable&quot;.  Eye for an eye, etc.  Someone whacks you, you whack 'em back.  Maybe twice if you really got suckerpunched to begin with.  But beyond that, you're just being a child.  Roleplaying is encouraged, everyone knows about my brothel of girls on Primus, some of whom even shave themselves completely for their non-Simian clients.  Dock camping is retarded, fully decked out Eagles taking out first-run-betting-the-farm-on-this-cargo-load newbies is unacceptable.  As a general rule I avoid specifics and/or examples when it comes to &quot;reasonable&quot;, if it comes down to it The Furrowed One decides what is reasonable, and that is it.  I'm quick to ban and maintain order, and everyone has a great time.  If you are having the time of your life and everyone else is miserable, I assure you it won't last long.  There has never been a &quot;no PK in Liberty&quot; rule, and for good reason.  I spend most of my time outside Planet  Manhatten, and I need to cap people, too <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Alot of the events include the newer characters, and occur within Liberty.  There are some people I trust to monitor things when I am not physically there, and I have not yet been dissapointed.  I have been known to turn the air blue with some choice words, but it is is moderation, as everything should be.  Everything in moderation, including moderation itself.  So there you have it, from the horse's mouth.  The Browclops server is designed for everyone to have fun.  If it gets too political, if it gets too difficult to maintain because of warring factions that I need to moderate, if one of my kids gets sick and I need to spend two weeks in the hospital, it will end.  I do what I can to assure stability and character data, but I cannot guarantee a tomorrow.  We have pirates, we have police-types, we have traders, we have lots of people who have 5 characters and each one has a different function.  Now I'm rambling, so I'm done for a spell.

I know default has many enemies and pisses a lot people off but you have to admit that he makes it interesting.  It just wouldn't be as fun if we all got along.  If you die, you die.  It's a friggin game.  If he kills you, stop crying and get in the fight.  Clans are fine but lets not turn this into another full blown clan-war server.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;Yo, in what Iv'e seen I believe this server is very programable in the sense we could get everyone into the habit of roleplaying. Not everyone of course, but some of the ones willing and over time become a natural thing&quot;
<br />
<br />Personally, I've been roleplaying for quite some time on the server.  No, I'm not an as5hole in real life, I just play one on TV.
<br />
<br />That's just it, you don't need some silly &quot;server police&quot; clan with the stupidest list of goals ever to roleplay.
<br />
<br />Take a look at the faction wars instituted by Major_As5hole and Amiral_Thrawn, which I participated in.  They were low-key, and warring was generally limited to the systems held by the factions.
<br />
<br />Of course, we ALSO discovered that we overestimated group dedications.  People aren't as fanatical when you start making restrictions and goals FOR THEM.  This is, after all, Freelancer.
<br />
<br />People would either:
<br />
<br />A. Completely disregard rules and regulations and dick around.
<br />
<br />B. Start showing less and less interest, and ultimately stop participating.
<br />
<br />Personally, I believe the current level of roleplaying structure we have is perfect, because it has no comittments.  You ARE the organization.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you require organizations to heighten the experience, then I suggest you keep it small and invite only fanatics...otherwise, your organization will rot.</div>

			<div class="content"><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Law 3: NO AFK !!!!!!!!!!!! (Away from keyboard)
<br />A: for more than 30 minutes anywhere on the server, since it keeps the server full and fewer people get to play.
<br />B: for more than 2 minutes on mission planets that have the (Too many players accessing the job board) bug. 
<br />
<br />How exactly do you plan to enforce this? Is Brow all of a sudden going to grant admin power to a bunch of GOV fanatics?
<br />
<br />You can't do anything about people sitting AFK inside bases, or on the job boards. The worst you can do is kick the little tards around when they leave base.
<br />
<br />Law 4: NO FOUL LANGUAGE on system chats. 
<br />
<br />Get bent. Brow loves the dirty 7. This is Bitterman's thing, let him enforce it with his GUNS if he wants to make a big deal.
<br />
<br />You'll probably find that the usage of profanities in system chat is actually quite limited, and only goes up when you start bitching about it.
<br />
<br />Law 5: NO PK'ing (for role playing purposes only and not intended to be obeyed.) 
<br />
<br />Ok. How many GOV members do I have to kill before I force you goodies over the line? Come on, random killing adds so much to the game.
<br />
<br />Law 6: PLAYERS MUST PAY TAXES/TOLL/TARRIFS (role playing) 
<br />
<br />See above. You toll me, you die. In fact, if you implement any sort of the above bull****, I'm certain Admiral Thrawn and I will get together some criminal element to terrorize you.
<br />
<br />And our battle cry will be...NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION! <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />The Screamin Demons have been attacked by these morons, and have been given an ultimatum to pay $2million. We will not be bullied, and we not stand by and watch this clan try to increase their power on Browclops by trying to enforce their own rules to the server. 
<br />
<br />As such, the Demons have wholy agreed to go to &quot;war&quot; with this &quot;clan&quot;. Anyone who wishes to help us can tell any member for [SD ingame. We appreciate all the help we can get.</div>

			<div class="content">Server has been up 11.5 hours, (since 9:32 am Eastern) but there are thunderstorms in the area.  I've been at the office before and seen a close lightning strike disconnect everyone external, that is, accessing through the T-1, but the program itself has not restarted.  My guess is everyone got disconnected for a split second, which is why it seemed so quick to get back on.  All network devices are on a building UPS and diesel backup generator, so it isn't an issue of no power, just a weird lightning thing.

			<div class="content">Good luck trying to enforce law:6 tolls and tarrifs, I'll be damned if I'll give any credits to anyone who's done nothing to earn it. I'm taxed outrageously in the real world, I won't tolerate it in a game. If you try to tax me, I'll refuse, if you attack me for refusing, I'll log off, I simply will not participate.
<br />By what right do you come along and lay down your edicts, you're just another damn clan trying to own someone else's server. 
<br /> A lot of us are playing to escape from the realities of day to day life, if only for a little while, we don't appreciate someone trying mimic the real world in this game.
<br /> The clans have a stranglehold on Elite, and it shows, people are beginning to look elsewhere to play because it's not fun to play on Elite anymore unless you're part of a gang of thugs.
<br /> I hope Browclops isn't going to go that route, and I'm dismayed to hear some clan's plans and &quot;orders&quot; for Browclops being laid out so blatantly.
<br /> Browclop's had a good thing going, there's an old saying, &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;, I hope he doesn't let some clan muck up the works.

			<div class="content">I see there are few players that are dedicated to anarchy.  That is great!!!  I was worried we might not have any enemies.
<br />
<br />Defaultuser,
<br />
<br />   You are one of the players that I have the most respect for and I value your opinion.  Don't take the laws of the [GOV too seriously or personally.  We are not server admins/police and do not intend to be.  We are a ROLE PLAYING clan.  A FICTIONAL GOVERNMENT.  Stress again.  A FICTIONAL GOVERNMENT Although a couple of the Laws are designed to help Brow with server criminals, [GOV Laws are need in order to role play as a government.  And I know, there are very few problems on Browclops as far as player behavior.  
<br />
<br />   As for enforcing AFK, we can&#8217;t.  It is just a law that will be used to site people for violations and to help make people aware of the harmfulness of excessive AFK.  Like brow said, moderation.  If brow is online and I am suffering from the actions of a negligent monkey snoring on Malta, then I might ask brow to boot him off so I can get some missions.  Anyone can make that request.  I don&#8217;t know if Browclops would accommodate, but it is worth a shot, since AFK while camping the job board is extremely frustrating and decreases Browclops players&#8217; fun.
<br />
<br />   The [GOV clan is being designed to increase roll playing, PvP, and the overall fun of all players on Browclops.  If too much clan warring takes place, then we will take measures to bring it back to a moderate level.  We hope that enemies will see the value of [GOV as a source of enemy opponents for them to whale on and not try to spoil the fun by excessive warring or crimes on innocent players, which can cause less fun for everyone. Don&#8217;t try to spoil it, just get the best out of it.
<br />
<br />   Now I will address the language Law.  There are virtually no problems with language on Browclops.  The law is to help maintain moderation and give [GOV more crimes to punish.  I am not going to blast people every time I hear the SH word or even the F word.  I will probably not act any differently than I have so far.  I only say something if there is a cussing match going on.  The primary purpose of the Law, as far as I am concerned, is to give rise to player conflict by invoking the need to apply a punishment to the unruly player&#8217;s red hinny.
<br />
<br />   Now I will address your habit of random killing, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!  It is great by itself, but it also gives the [GOV some role-playing work to do.  Thanks!  You seem to be missing my point when I say No Pking (&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;For roll playing purposes only and not intended to be obeyed.&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  We need some criminals like you to punish.  Your random killing is great, but with a government to punish you, we could get a little more out of it.  Maybe for you it is enough alone, but why not involve everyone so they can fight back against you.  Try to fight the organization so you can keep on random killing with no consequences.   But, that seems like less of a challenge when few people can give you an ass whooping.  We hope to change that.
<br />
<br />   You say that there are plenty of clan wars between you and your friends.  Well, we can clan war too and if you have a problem with that, then too bad.  You have your private little clan wars off to the side where most everyone else has no idea its going on.  That&#8217;s great for not disturbing players, which I value also.  But, while you do that, we&#8217;ll try to get more people involved in PvP.   Maybe others would like to know how they can get in on the clan warring.
<br />
<br />   I heed your warnings about things that will make the organization rot.  I will try to do what I can to stop it and I have already thought of those potential problems myself.  Members that are completely ignorant about the [GOV clan, that they have so flippantly joined, can hurt the clan and dilute its purpose.  As of now, many members know little.  The goals that have yet to be set for members are to help keep the clan experienced and keep up PvP skills.  We do not want to rot into a careless newb clan.
<br />
<br />&#8220;TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION!!!&#8221;.  Wah Wah Wah!!!  Poor guys!!!  I feel so bad for you.  Not!!!  All players will be represented.  Everyone has the right under Federal Law to speak their minds by raising issues with a [GOV official and will be able to cast their votes on issues.  So cry your &#8220;taxation without representation&#8221; all you want, cause it will be your own fault if you are not represented.  I hope you do speak your mind to us, which I am sure as hell you will.  We need your input and the input of everyone that has a mind to say something.
<br />
<br />&#8220;TOLLS/TAXES/TARRIFS&#8221;.  Evade taxes all you want, while we do our best to punish you.  Terrorize away.  I like it.  More PvP for me. J
<br />
<br />You say to &#8220;Get Bent.&#8221;  Well, you got us bent.  Let me stress again.  [GOV is ROLE PLAYING clan.  Not server police!  The laws resemble server police and we may help them, but we are a ROLE PLAYING clan.  A FICTIONAL GOVERNMENT.  So take your FICTIONALLY CRIMINAL self and commit some crimes.

<br />  Didn't know we were already charging fines.  I will have to investigate this, since we have not officially given power to levy fines and taxes yet at this point.  But you have been fined none the less, so &quot;PAY IT&quot; J/K

<br />  You are a loser if you log out just cause you get some PvP activity.  This is not going to be a clan of thugs and if you log off then you should just stick with the single player.
<br />  [GOV is going to be charging light taxes just to do something that fits what a government would do.  Are you going to get pissed if somone charges you 50 credits for a freakin Tariff.  The [GOV earns the money cause we are going to host events with our own money.  Taxes will not be a significant source of money.  Plus we will be putting bounties on players which will be fun for everyone.
<br />  I see your point about too many thug clans.  I hope that [GOV will not become that and if I can help it it won't.  We are not trying to own the server.  The theme is government, so we got laws to enforce.  What the hell is wrong with that!  It is a role playing freakin clan!!!  Freakin role play dude.  I really hope that this clan doesn't spoil the fun for anyone.  I am just trying to give everyone more opportunities to role play.  So pay the taxes or don't pay them and fight or get bounties put on you.  We aren't necessarily going to blow you up on the spot cause you refuse.  We might just put you on our list of people to put bounties on when we get around to it.
<br /> 
<br />pthsssss  I am done for now.
<br />
<br />Regulator
<br />
<br />PS maybe we won't tax you cause you don't like to role play and I don't want to spoil browclops for you, but that could get abused by others.  We'll see how it goes.</div>

			<div class="content">Nice &quot;government&quot;, Regulator. The most members of your clan I've seen online at one time is one. How can you expect to do any role-playing withour more members.
<br />
<br />Also, if you want to do roleplaying, I suggest you take your whole clan over to Forst-Works RPG Mod Server 2. It lets the police and navy heavily enforce the laws that they deem appropriate. <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.frost-works.com">www.frost-works.com</a><!-- w --></div>
