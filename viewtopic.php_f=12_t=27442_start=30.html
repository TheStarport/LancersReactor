			<div class="content">fair enough! Well I quite liked it - although yes I agree it was cliche ridden - I just felt that there hasn't been a british film like it for a long long time.  Good effort as far as I'm concerned.  I know what you mean about the Day of the Triffids though.
<br />
<br />As for the alternate ending - I heard about this, but I'm yet to meet anyone who's seen it.  They're showing it on Sky, but I refuse to pay another &#163;4 just to watch a different last 5 minutes.  Anybody know how it ends??</div>

			<div class="content">Basically, the main difference is that the blockade is in front of the laboratory that began the movie - the Army mansion is no longer in the film. Jim, Selena and Hannah go to the lab (with Hannah's father, as despite his infection he has not been killed). They find it empty, except for one locked room. Behind the door there is a man who does not talk, and will not open the door. From what I remember, the man never talks, but eventually lets Selena, Hannah and Hannah's dad in, after Jim has performed a total blood transfusion with Hannah's dad, thus infecting himself and curing him. So the film comes full circle from the monkey on an operating table to Jim on an operating table. 
<br />
<br />Actually as a story it's cr*pper but cuts down on characters, keeps the Dad alive, gets rid of Jim (good) but he ending is darker and more in keeping with the film. btw you can only see it on the DVD, as storyboards.</div>

<br />
<br />Caro wasn't involved in Alien Resurrection.  They parted ways because Caro didn't want to work for Hollywood.  And I liked the movie because it is the funniest and most colourful of the whole series.
<br />
<br />As for 28 Days Later, I really liked the film except for the way the soldiers acted in the end.  I'm surprised you didn't have a problem with it being an ex-soldier yourself, they were set up as well trained soldiers, but as soon as it's important for the main character to get back the girls, they go from trained to incompetent and sloppy.  I understand a lot of things were happening, but the training was gone completely.
<br />
<br />As for Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, I liked the film.  It's a bit oppressive in the drugginess at times, but it is well done and a hell of a lot better than the original film &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam ...&quot; starring Bill Murray in the role Johnny Depp does a much better job.

			<div class="content">I liked 28 Days Later alot.  It was nicely done.  But I hated there style of Zombie fighting.
<br />
<br />They were using a baseball bat and a machiet I think...Why not go into a gun store, or get a sword or something like that?  They do have places you can buy guns in London don't they?  And do they have Army Surplus stores over there?  
<br />
<br />I had to agree with the army men, &quot;What can 9 men do without women?&quot;  In civilation, women are the key.   They are the essance of life.  Have women, you have civilation, just have men and you have nothing.

<br />me no pongo, me a sailor! i didn't like the way they just broke apart either, but this was one of the few areas that was consistent in the film, Major west explains that morale is breaking down and his men are on the edge, one of them has already tried to commit suicide, and the Rage is totally terrifying. They are fine when they're shooting from their prepared positions at the stupid zombies outside, but when it gets in with them they collapse quickly; that's actually not too unrealistic. Bereft of their support system and the chain of command, small groups of cut-off isolated soldiers can go to pieces esp. if they know they ain't gonna be rescued. Also remember they shot their Sergeant who a decent bloke, and they're generally a fairly unpleasant and malicious bunch.

			<div class="content">i didn't notice that, but yes you're right FF. thats' very possible. makes perfect sense in the context of the film.
<br />
<br />Anyone notice the appearance of a jetplane before the final sequence? I wasn't sure whether it was just a filming accident (jet contrails are common bloopers in films) or whether it was deliberate to indicate that the world had survived, the Rage had been contained to the UK and that things could return to normal, adding poignancy to the Sergeant's murder because he turned out to be right, and Major West could have seen that. i think Major West actually enjoyed his insane little island-fortress and din't want to return to &quot;normal&quot; where he wouldn't be able to play God with people's lives. 
<br />
<br />don't the infected eat anything, btw? they sleep, prob pee and no 2s, so why don't they eat, even each other? and why don't they attack each other? do they only seek out the uninfected?</div>

			<div class="content">@Taw, about 28 Days Later ... I can understand them no longer working as team as cohesively as before, but it still seemed as if they went from military soldiers to flailing stock brokers in fatigues.  It's been a few weeks since I've seen the film, but each of them were making stupid silly mistakes repeatedly out of character of anyone who had training.  No matter how demoralized you may be, you still have your training and at the end it seemed as if they'd never spent a day in boot camp, or whatever the Br*t term for it is.

			<div class="content">@FF, yes, but the director gave them time to prove themselves when the three arrived at the compound.  They demonstrated they knew what they were doing to a certain degree, but later they knew nothing.  They carried themselves completely differently.  And the circumstances weren't that different just closer up.
<br />
<br />I could understand a few acting irrationally, but not all of them.  Because you don't have to be the lowest of the low in skill to be a complete arse and want to rape women and be cruel.  Some people like that are often more grounded and viscious because of their amoral attitude.  They can take a certain sense of selfish pride they're more brutal or a better soldier than others.

			<div class="content">well i think all these issues can be put down to bad writing, inconsistent character development, and some poor casting. there were some cheap actors in there who i recognised from some pretty lame stuff. it suited Danny Boyle to have the soldiers fall apart quickly, I think it the context of the film that it actually worked, but not without problems.
<br />
<br />Myself there are other issues with this film that stand out more, to the point when I was watching i was openly saying that it was just cr*p. Take the Character of Jim, around whom the film revolves. Ok he hasn't a clue what's happend, he's confused, weak; blunders about, gets lucky that ghe runs into some uninfected who drag him off to safety. Makes a mistake and gets one of them killed (Mark) starts to toughen up and  adapt and quite ruthlessly hacks to bits an infected kid, doesn't even mention it when he comes out of the cafe of death. 
<br />
<br />But later on, fighting for his life against nasty soldiers and hordes of infected, he picks up a loaded assault rifle, shoots once at an inanaimat object, and throws the weapon away in disgust, then engages in hand to hand combat with a trained soldier? see what's wrong with this picture? THEN he has rumpy-pumpy with the only available female who a few seconds before was gonna slay him because he's covered in blood and dirt and looks like he's infected! ok i can accept that danger can make you horny, it's happened to me many times, but not in a house full of psycho Army guys and bloodthisty zombies. 
<br />
<br />Frank's death was a disgraceful bit of plot development, very crudely done, at this point I realised that Danny Boyle had dug himself into a hole with this film and was desperately trying to find a way out. If i could rermake one scene that would be it. I wasn't bothered about Frank dying (i'd have preferred Hannah <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) but it was total rubbish, &quot;hey let's make a poignant scene&quot; but not have any idea how to go about it.
<br />
<br />This film got hyped up to the eyeballs (No pun intended! for those who've seen it) and it was utterly disappointing after the first 20mins or so, the only originality being in the clever use of video rather than film stock. stick to drugs and hippies Dan, you can make films about those. 
<br />
<br />The Quiet Earth was a far superior post-apocalyptic offereing and covered much the same ground (without the Zombies) far more intelligently and coherently. Why are Oz &amp; Kiwi films just so bl**dy good? Night of the Comet was just a big laugh, but it was played for laughs and was far more consistent and didn't ry to be clever - and in that respect worked much better on film. Survivors was in a league of its own; very clever, very gripping, totally realistic -  Terry Nation's finest hour.
<br />
<br />One of my favourite films is &quot;The Keep&quot; by Michael Mann; i say one of my favourites because I don't thnink it's actually that good, being objective, but I still like it a lot! it has many deep flaws, and the casting is very poor other than Jurgen Prochnow and Gabriel Byrne, but it is one of the most atmospheric and hypnotic films I've ever seen, surpassed in this respect only by Baraka or Poyaaniquaatsi imho. Anyone care to comment?
