			<div class="content">The area around the site was clear this morning, no new tracks and no dust on the horizon. I grabbed my pack and put it on. And picked up a couple of torches. Flash lights would not be of too much help here. The interior was large, about eighteen feet high. The path led downward into the ground. It looked like there were stairs at one time, but had been worn by centuries of walking the path. Our destination lay down there, somewhere. We were headed into the unknown. Armed only with rumors as to what was here and what the treasure truly was. 
<br />
<br />Mustang took the lead with ff bringing up the rear. We each had rope and torches incase we got separated. Mustang estimated it was at least five hundred yards under ground. Further than I was comfortable with, add to that another person, Viator, to which I knew nothing about. It was a little unnerving to say the least. But, still, I was getting my wish of adventure. 
<br />
<br /><b>Journal entry five      </b>: The walk was easy to begin with, The light of five torches was enough for us to see any obstacles. The rock formations looked more of either limestone or sandstone. Which would explain the condition of the steps. The sound was only our walking, the foot falls echoing on the walls. The path stayed to the right side of the area. The darkness ahead was intense. Like the area swallowed up the light from our torches. 
<br />
<br />After an hour of walking, we stopped for a break and sat against the wall. I broke out a little snack and some water. The others just had some water. I had not thought we would be walking this far. I was trying to figure how far below the surface we had come and guessed about five hundred feet down and about three quarters of a mile winding down. I did notice a slight wind blowing from the lower section. That meant air had to be getting in from some where. I was also concerned of any water down here. 
<br />
<br />Two hours in to it, we came to a ledge and drop off. We could not see down at the bottom. There was a tiny light glint on something way across from us. No way to make out what it was from here. Mustang took one of the lit torches and dropped it off the ledge. It dropped about fifty feet down and showed the floor area. Jagged and full of boulders. And a skeleton. It looked impaled on something. 
<br />
<br />Final tied off a line and dropped it down and ff did one as well. We had no choice but to climb down if we wanted to go on. One after another, we climbed down to the floor. The chamber was huge. Even with all our torches, we could not see it all. Mustang took the torch he had dropped and flung it with all his might toward the center of the area. It disappeared. It didn&#8217;t go out, it disappeared, down. No sight of it at all. Another drop off. We could however, see the glint of light again and began moving towards it. 
<br />
<br />We hardly got twenty five feet and we had to stop. The drop off. It looked to be covering the whole of the area, with only a three foot wide path going around it to walk on. It would be far more dangerous from here on out. 
<br />
<br />I had a weird feeling. One I could not put my finger on. Like danger near, but not clear. It wasn&#8217;t the pit, that was seen and known. It was something else. I took the lead and we headed towards the glint. Times we had to hug the wall when the path reduced to one foot wide. Rocks at out feet skidded over the edge bouncing on the way down, but never striking the bottom. 
<br />
<br />This little trail came to an end. About thirty feet short of our goal. ff through his torch near the glint. It landed just below it. It shone bright in the light, A Star. But not like a regular star, a Star of David. It looked to be about eight inches across.  Now was hearing other sounds in the area, but did not pay attention to them as I got my rope ready. There was a large rock on the other side that was the perfect size to tie off to. I tied my end like a lasso and through it. It took me three tries to get it. Mustang drove a stake in on our side and tied it off to it. I began the climb down so I could grab on and began to cross the thirty feet to the other side. 
<br />
<br />I had just reached the other side when I noticed light near the ropes that we climbed down on. Voices, several men were there as well. One fired a gun in the air. The sound sent a shock wave through all of us and a low rumble in the cavern. Rock and dust fell from the ceiling way above us. Then the voice, one that I had heard before....
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, what do we have here&#8221; the voice echoed in the chamber. The voice was Eraser&#8217;s, from the restaurant. &#8220;It looks like you were trying to take something that belongs to me!&#8221; Now there were about five torches on the ledge looking down at us. Five men with an advantage we had not planed for. &#8220;sw, you really should have met me on the pier for that talk, we might could have avoided all of this.&#8221;
<br />
<br />I realized he was the one who wrote the note and probably went through my room, but who went through my things on the boat? This bothered me a little, but, not as much as trying to figure a solution to the current situation. They had us at a disadvantage. I moved closer to the star so I could get a better look. Then I began digging and unearthed the object. It was a large shield. One with a gold star on it. Cleaned up, it would show as all gold, worth a fortune in its weight or as a relic of an historical time period.
