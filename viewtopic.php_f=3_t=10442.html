			<div class="content">I understand this is a forum, and people are entitled to their own thoughts and opinions. But sometimes I read through these posts and all I see is ranting and complaining about almost every aspect. I mean, have any of you people ever thought about just going out and enjoying the game? (now im not saying ALL People, just many, such as Orca_******) which was censored purposefully so the post doesnt get locked. Im kind of sick of people constantly saying about how the voice acting is so bad, theres not enough ships, the game is too easy, the campaign is too short, its too easy to get weapons, and finally, the MOST annoying of all, whenever someone mentions changing prices and cargo, about 100 people come on saying &quot;you see ships carrying 80,000 of this and that, why would you think your tiny little hold of 250 of this and that can affect prices&quot; or whenever someone makes a post with a intention of humor its always &quot;man, its just a game or get a life or something in the manner.
<br />
<br />So what if its easy and short, nobody forces you to buy a game. Its made to be a action game, not a epic space drama.  Cheating, cheating is bad, frankly I dont know what kind of loser needs to invest time cheating at a game, make the game too easy (and yes there is quite a bit of them on the forums, of course they arent saying who they are) and then come on here and start raving about how short and easy it is. And you know what, im also sick of people saying how short the campaign is and ultimately asking &quot;is that it?&quot;. No, thats not it, the game is about freelancing, you, in your own misinterpretation made the mistake of blazing through the campaign at lightning speed (maybe not even stopping to ENJOY it along the way) and then say how short it is, nobody is FORCING you to goto a server, play for 6 hours straight, buy a titan, get a ton of nomad guns and the best shield and go dominate everything and say &quot;is that it?&quot;.
<br />
<br />It was your own mistake to do so, and you deal with it, I just wonder dont people ever actually PLAY the game the way it was meant? Play it through slowly, enjoy it, try being a outlaw, try being a miner, what is stopping a guy from staying in new york and exploring every frickin nook and cranny in a patriot? Why does EVERYONE have the tendency to move up as fast as possible and buy the titan or the sabre, dominate everything and get bored. Try being a little weaker (such as in a valkyrie or something) and try making the game a little harder, push your piloting skill to the limit. For some reason, after all this time on these forums, and visiting every few days I am faithfully welcomed by about 100 new posts about people complaining about the game. Frankly, I know I cant do anything about it, but im just expressing my overindulgent anger at these people, Neither do I care that I cant do anything about it, Im just hoping some people see this and check themselves.
<br />
<br />I am seriously considering leaving the forum for quite a while and going on to something more productive, as I get enough complaining and nagging during the day.</div>

			<div class="content">He - I couldn't agree more! Whatever we as moderators do, it is wrong in somebodies eyes... Very annoying... I think we do what we can to keep the &quot;moaners&quot; down, though we can not silence them completly... And most actually agree that Freelancer does have some weak spots, even while these can be covered in a 5-point list...
<br />
<br />As it stands, I'll close this thread, but I hope a few people are going to read it and reconsider giving Freelancer a beating... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_clown.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
