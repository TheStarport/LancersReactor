			<div class="content">Ok now that I had a look at what this FLCharadmin is I can surely say that I didn't mean it.
<br />I meant something like those stats. But in the end it doesn't really matter.
<br />
<br />I had a look at the forum and there is a difference between what does exist and what is available. And I noticed enough threads where people asked for information, threads which kept being unanswered. There was something about missions, something about tax and alot more.
<br />
<br />I am sorry but i only need to search for OPs posts here at LR to see what he shares and who he helped. Let's just take this week. There was something about nav maps or something like that where he did share knowledge and offered to create the files. Then today he announced a new game for this community, which means months of work. In various other situations he answered other peoples questions and this GLS replacement he is working on is very likely also a free contribution to the lancer community. Not to mention that countless concepts that he released with his mods and that are now used by so many other mods.
<br />
<br />You say that you don't care about what he shares but then you complain that he didn't give you any details on his plans? Common that does not fit.
<br />I can only speculate how this current GLS bypass does work but i can say for sure that it does work. Like I said earlier I didn't experience any downtimes in the past year. And if he does say that he has an even better solution or is working on a better solution then I am going to believe him because he never made bad jokes about such things and everything he announced became reality. Why should I even bother if he does not tell me how it does work? Is the GLS down already? Do I want to use his work for my own purpose? No.
<br />The dynamic universe? 
<br />I can only say that it does work perfectly. More i don't know.
<br />Did you ever go to him directly to ask him? I bet you didn't. Maybe that would have been a genious idea.

			<div class="content">&gt;You say that you don't care about what he shares but then you complain that he didn't give you any details on his plans? Common that does not fit.
<br />
<br />You misunderstood me there. Its not about his plans. He talked about &quot;already working&quot; solutions that are better than emulation. And if you refer to existing better solutions you should actually show or share them IMHO.
<br />
<br />But lets leave it at that.
<br />The GLS wont be down too soon anyways.
<br />
<br />PS: oh and if anyone is asking me for some code of our flhook features, I always put them on the FLHook Developer board for the public. Its not like we sit on our features and think to be more cool than the rest of the community.
<br />Of course I dont have always time for that and I wont put trivial changes there that only require basic c++ coding.. things like a tax command can be implemented in FLHook very easily. The more complex things such as cloaking and this mobile docking thing are available there nonetheless.

			<div class="content">stop it matt, its enough
<br />
<br />its a fact that i dont share knowledge with ppl that try starting trouble with me... but i announced that here already and thought this would be well known by now because it was discussed on a different thread already (and to my knowledge ppl agreed that its ok)
<br />that ppl start trouble because i dont share knowledge with them leads do a neverending circle of flames
<br />eventhough i heavily believe that it is my own decision with who i share stuff and that the LR forum rules have to be followed im going to reply here to end this crap
<br />
<br />
<br />the GLS bypass is currently part of the latest Crossfire mod, it is directly integrated into the gamedata and from those 100.000 ppl that downloaded i didnt hear a single complain about that the GLS or the server was not available while on other forums including LR ppl went nuts when the gls was down just for one or two days
<br />the GLS replacement is a highly difficult and at the current point of time illegal change of network code
<br />illegal because the original GLS server is still online and property of microsoft and the msn gaming zone network
<br />im not going to release more details about it because IT IS illegal and because if someone does try to do it before the GLS server has been taken from the net the whole thing will fail before it even started
<br />why do i think that it will work and that it is a better solution? well because it did work for another game aswell and because players wont even see the difference to the original
<br />
<br />
<br />finally the dynamic universe
<br />the CF dynamic universe is a highly complicated script which deals with FL coding anomalies and server/client differences
<br />the script was written for the CF mod and is not compatible with other mods or vanilla FL since the CF server structure is very much different from a normal FL server
<br />basically you would have to forget everything about what ppl did preach in the past years about clean modding because the idea behind this is to create &quot;errors&quot; without that FL does notice them and without that a memory leak or a crash is the result. The final result are moving fleets, random jumpholes, technical malfunctions of stations and other solar objects, system invasions, discoveries of new systems and much more. Of course everything connected with the ingame news and a php interface called CFNN
<br />
<br />
<br />enough information? happy now?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />@Rankor
<br />if you create 5 ships for a mod and put them on a server you create more lag than the basic flhook
