			<div class="content">The town of Tawsburg has changed in the last ten years. It has grown to a little over five thousand people. With the outlaw gang stopped, growth began. There was even a railroad passing the edge of town. So much has changed. Sycho_Warrior had an assistant and was interviewing an additional teacher. The school house was due to have an addition added to the rear to give more classrooms. The students under her tutelage had progressed above all expectation. Even those who had not favored her teaching here, had been won over. She even had begun some impressive writing on the side. 
<br />
<br />Things changed a lot six years ago with the discovery of gold in Sutter&#8217;s Mill. A few folk left to give it a try. Dr. Taw was one of them, but he returned just last year. He had gotten a few bags of dust, but decided not to push his luck. He had informed the folks of a few deaths as a result of street gunfights. He had to watch the death of pSYCHO. The fight was unexpected. pSYCHO had left the saloon with a small bag of gold and was heading to the claims office to stake his. The man who challenged him didn&#8217;t care. All he wanted was the bag of dust. &#8220;I tired to tell pSYCHO to just give it to him, but he wouldn&#8217;t listen&#8221;. &#8220;He never got his gun out of that new holster he had made, I buried him in the hills over looking his claim site.&#8221; Taw was down for weeks after he got back. It took Esq getting him riled up a bit to get Taw out of his slump. 
<br />
<br />Indy now had a daily paper. His staff of six managed to cover all the local color and even some of the regional activities. He took great pride in the accuracy of his articles. He believed in keeping the people informed. The paper was up to fifteen pages and sold for two cents by some kids selling them on the street corners. The town around Indy had changed a lot. Most was for the better. 
<br />
<br />The jail had been replaced three years ago and Bargib decided to step down as sheriff and take a more administrative position. The deputies would jointly over see things. They were Stinger, Chips, Mustang, Wizard a new citizen in town, Boscoe, though he had been occupied as of lately. They did an excellent job in keeping the peace. An occasional trouble maker wandered into town, but was quickly informed of the laws and told to conform or leave. A few got locked up for disorderly conduct, but there had been no gunfights. Such as was life in Tawsburg. 
<br />
<br />Wolfy, now twenty three, was working at the mill turning out lumber. He had done so well in school, sw had him over to the school to lend a teaching hand to some of the more wild young boys. His friend, Eh_steve had headed back east with his family after the gang matter and were due to return soon. 
<br />
<br />Orillion had to contend with only the deathly ill folk dying to bury. Very few folk died here thanks to Dr. Esq. His repeated treatments and reminders had help the people keep well for the most part. He was really big on preventative. He would often scold people who would not listen to his advice and got themselves sick. But, deep down, he cared for all the people of the town, even his nemesis, Dr. Taw. Dr. Esq was even rumored to be looking for a wife, if you could believe the rumors. We shall see.
<br />
<br />The download kept Bakedpotato busy enough. People had a lot for him to post in his store. It kept him busy and brought him enough profit that he could retire in a few more years. The latest version of clothing and goods were available to all who came into town. So much had changed, but a lot had remained. Even the Forum still kept busy. There were a lot of new faces and a few of the regulars as well. All would be welcomed there. 
<br />
<br />Stinger was making his nightly rounds through the northern part of town. A lone figure came riding slowly into town in the main street. Stinger could not make out the face, but a glint of silver was seen in the lantern light. &#8220;Heyah&#8221; Stinger spurred his mount. He headed over to the rider. They met up near the livery stable. The face lifted up....&#8221;Locutus&#8221; Stinger said in surprise, &#8220;What brings you back to town&#8221;.
<br />
<br />Chips headed for his house. It was a long day down at the Pathfinderstudios as he called the area. He had a mock up of a small town, complete with buildings, trees, and riders on horse back. He was tinkering with name, evolutions, but still had not made up his mind yet. He did enjoy the work and hoped to have a full size version done one day. But for now, his deputy duties kept him busy enough.

			<div class="content">To Continue-
<br />
<br />Chips headed for his house. It was a long day down at the Pathfinderstudios as he called the area. He had a mock up of a small town, complete with buildings, trees, and riders on horse back. He was tinkering with name, evolutions, but still had not made up his mind yet. He did enjoy the work and hoped to have a full size version done one day. But for now, his deputy duties kept him busy enough. 
<br />
<br />sw, as she was sometimes called, was just putting up the class books on the shelves and had the slates stacked near the back wall. She loved teaching, but could hardly wait to get home to her house and put pen to paper with her story she was writing. It was, she had said, a story of fiction but with a ring of truth and included several of the towns people. She drew good reviews of some of her earlier works and wanted this one to be even better. Wolfy walked in, startling her a little. He had promised to stop by and give her a ride home as her buggy was at the livery being repaired. She had broken the axle when her horse came loose from the rig and the buggy hit a large rock. Thankfully, she was able to get out of it with only a few scratches.
<br />
<br />The bell over the Jail door jingled as Stinger and Locutus walked in. &#8220;Can I get you anything&#8221; Stinger asked as he sat at the desk. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;A whiskey, if you have it&#8221;Locutus replied. And pulled up a chair and turned it around backwards and sat facing Stinger. Stinger opened the side drawer and got out a bottle and two glasses and set them out. He let Locutus pour. After locutus threw one back and poured a second, he set it down on the desk. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get to the point&#8221;.
<br />
<br />Indy had the next days edition of the paper put to bed and was preparing to lock up. He was looking out the newspaper office when he had seen Stinger and the other rider headed for the jail. His nose for news was twitching something awful. He would ask Stinger later, now he just wanted to get over to the Forum and a meal. The food was ok, but he was hungry.
<br />
<br />Mustang was just finishing his round on the southwestern side of the town and was headed to the Forum to check on things. Things had only changed a little for Mustang in the last ten years. He still loved the town, but was looking to settle down a bit. He had not met a filly he liked yet, but the way the town was growing, it could still happen. He knew he had to give it time. 
<br />
<br />Around midnight, a lone ride ambled into town and headed to the stables. After tying up his horse and putting the his saddle on the fence, he took his bedroll and bunked down behind the barn. The hotel was closed and he didn&#8217;t want to wake anyone this late. He would meet folk in the morning and get down to business. A dangerous business at that.
<br />
<br />Bargib had his house in town now that he was an administrator and could keep an eye on things without even leaving his house. At the moment though, he had a guest over. Wizard had stopped by and they were in the midst of swapping stories when he noticed the light on in the jail. He knew from time to time, a deputy would stop in, but this time the light had been on from near dusk. Too long for things to be ok. &#8220;Wizard, how about you and me taking a walk over to the Jail&#8221; Bargib asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are you serious, the President of the United States is going to be on the train?&#8221; Stinger asked, incredulous. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s right, President Franklin Pierce is going to be on the train in one week as he heads out to the west coast, and the US marshals office is recruiting men to be a guard when the train stops here to take on wood and water&quot; Locutus answered. 
<br />
<br />The bell jingled as Bargib and Wizard walked in. The two seated looked up, expecting the visit. Almost all were here. The others could be told come morning.

<br />
<br />The bell jingled as Bargib and Wizard walked in. The two seated looked up, expecting the visit. Almost all were here. The others could be told come morning. 
<br />
<br />Wolfy slowed the buggy as he approached sw&#8217;s house. He set the break and hopped out and went around to sw&#8217;s side and offered his hand to help her down. She excepted it and offered a thank you. &#8220;Your welcome, Ma&#8217;am&#8221; Wolfy replied with a blush. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now Wolfy, your old enough to call me sw, so don&#8217;t be so formal&#8221; she spoke, a smile on her face as she went into her house. Wolfy, seemingly startled for a moment, jumped when the horse whinnied. He thought on what she said as he started for home. By the time he arrived, he had concluded that she was just being nice was all. Still, it brought a smile to his face. 
<br />
<br />The Forum was a little slow tonight. Mustang had taken a seat in the back away from the music that was being played by a few of the regulars on guitar. Stormtrooper was there. A little dusty from the trail . He worked on one of the ranches after he and pSYCHO split up. The holster deal fell through. Storm had tried to convenience pSYCHO that there was a bad flaw in it and the gun would stick. In the end, he had been proven right. But, the death of pSYCHO had still hit him hard. He took this job to keep a roof over his head. But all in all, the work was easy and he had a fair amount saved up. Mustang saw Indy walk in and waved him over. After grabbing a beer, Indy settled down at Mustangs table.
<br />
<br />Dawn came with a little breeze. A roster could be heard in town. The man behind the stable was already up and had his horse saddled. He knew the town and where he had to go. I looked the telegram over again and then folded it and stuffed it in his shirt pocket. He mounted up and ambled on into town. Folks he passed waved, at least the ones who knew him. He waved back but didn&#8217;t stop to talk. Time for that later. He had a meeting with Bargib to get to. The sun glint of the star on his chest, US Marshal.
<br />
<br />Aod found the note pined to the door when he got to the livery. It said payment was being left for the use of the coral for the night and had two bits in a small pouch attached to the nail next to the letter. Archon would be in later in the day. He was rounding up some stock they had to sale today. They had turned a tidy profit with the ranchers using their place for the sale of some prime mares this year. 
<br />
<br />Bargib and all the deputies were at the forum. He got the use of it for a meeting and needed the space. Chips, Stinger, Mustang, Wizard were there and Locutus. The door opened and in walked Fear Factor. &#8220;Well I be dang nabbed&#8221; Bargib said, &#8220;I would never have figured you for a Marshal FF&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good to see you too, Bargib&#8221; Fear Factor said, shaking hands all around. He was glad to be back and see some familiar faces again.  &#8220;Looks like a lot of work for us this week&#8221; he added.
<br />
<br />Bargib deferred to Locutus who motioned for everyone to have a seat around the table. &#8220;Gentlemen, this train will be here for a little over four hours to take on wood and water:&#8221; he spoke, &#8220;and while it is, the President has asked to look around the town during that time.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Chips lifted a hand and spoke, &#8220;Why would he be interested in our town.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Bargib answered that one, &#8220;He heard of the trouble we had ten years ago and the outcome and our progress and said he thought it was extraordinary.&#8221;
<br />		
<br />&#8220;This is also a mid point in the trip on the rail and I assured him it would be a safe place to stop and take on water&#8221; locutus added. 
<br />
<br />Neo_Kuja and Gowserpaul started to head into the Forum, but chips turned them away, telling them to come back in a few hours. They didn't know what to make of it. They just knew they were thirsty and need a drink and a little of the local discussion. 
<br />
<br />sycho_warrior loved to seat at her desk and write. The story she was working on was a good one. It was fiction, but it gave her a little more leeway with the story. It was called Reactor Adventures. It was set aboard a ship with two different classes of midshipmen. It was a tale of adventure and surprise.
