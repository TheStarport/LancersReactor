			<div class="content">I have a mod idea but I can't make it. It is to make the game more balanced and more fun so that you can buy a Titan and still have some challenge in the starting systems but also that you wont get creamed just trying to get to Omicron Alpha in a startracker And make other more realistic changes like people other than you smuggling artifacts and other stuff around non-hostile police and navy patrols.
<br />
<br /> Here are the following changes That I need In My Mod:
<br />
<br />#1 There is no story mode and you always start at level 1
<br />
<br />#2 You can choose your starting planet or in some cases stations. Depending on where you start you can choose different clothes for your character but can always choose your head. This also chooses your reputation, Starting Ship, How much of nav map is revealed (for instance starting on denver will reveal places that one from liberty might see but not hidden wrecks, jump holes, stations, or criminal/ unknown systems while starting on Crete will reveal many places friendly to corsairs or places a corsair may have been to before.). If you start on crete you get the smallest corsair ship while most planets just give a starflier.
<br />
<br />#3 Bots now regenerate shields and it is optional for nanobots and batteries too
<br />
<br />#4 There are now battleship and gunboat encounters but they are rare. They also have Shields that are about as strong as there hull but regenerate slowly. Transports also now have Shields.
<br />
<br />#5 all ships are balanced and have a speed increse of 100 for engines, thrusters, and cruise engines plus 10 more speed for light fighters, Minus ten for very heavy fighters, and minus 20 for freighters. they also have similar armor ratings light fighters will have small amounts but can turn on a dime while freighters are just the opposites. so a starflier with a good pilot can take on a few titans if he's good enough. and all ships have similar cargo holds depending on weight classes.
<br />
<br />#6 you can now find people other than you smuggling or just traveling by themselves. there team is called freelancer (note that it is singular) and it's not on the reputation list so if you attack one it will not affect the majority of them, only the one that was attacked. some of them will be seen fighting pirates but some will be seen helping them or some will have nothing to do with them.
<br />
<br />#7 there are now escape pods but they are rare.
<br />
<br />#8 you can now send messages to a bot like drop cargo and select what you want them to drop, sometimes they'll drop it but sometimes they'll tell you &quot; You'r gonna Have to take it&quot; and become hostile to you. you can also create a team with a name and ask freelancer bots to join, and if they agree then your reputation becomes there reputation and they will be waiting outside of where you are docked to follow you everytime you do a mission, otherwise they are always gone but you can call them in the bot chat list and they will appear within half a minute and form up with you. There is a limit to how many bot members can be in your group.
<br />
<br />#8 You can create a base on a dockable planet and it shows up on the place selection at the top of the screen which is a place to store commodities and weapons for later use and can also be built in space to make an outpost but these are destructable and they make a good place to save in a hostile system. make sure you hide them away from your enemies regular patrol routes
<br />
<br />#9 it can be hard to be allies with the blood dragons and still do missions with the bounty hunters against other pirates that have nothing to do with the blood dragons so now doing a mission with someone's enemy will not turn them hostile towards you unless it involves their team
<br />
<br />#10 new missions including pirating shippments, protecting shipments out of a system, shipping something to another system (mission cargo), and rare Battleship or gunboat hunting missions which may include more than one or a fighter escort.
<br />
<br />#11 new florida system, even more funny unknown system like a planet that looks like the death star and 4 neutron stars close to each other way back in the back. and I'm thinking about ship designs but I can't get that perfect Heavy Fighter.
<br />
<br />#12 You can now join teams and by doing this can get advanced missions where you go out with a team as either a leader in that team or be a part of a group on large scale battles or Dangerous patrol missions.
<br />
<br />So that's my mod and this is a single player mod that is not required to be in multiplayer but it would be a nice addition. I would Like this mod to be compatible with mod manager V 1.3. If you decide to make this mod please reply and when it's done you could post it in the downloads section of this site.any problems or suggestions for an addition to this mod like ship designs would be good to post here So PLEASE SOMEONE MAKE THIS MUCH NEEDED FOR FREELANCER MOD!

			<div class="content">#1 &amp; #2 Chips OpenSP version (dl from this site) does most of this. You will need to add sections for the head choice and nav map content (hint : in the list in m13.ini and mpnewplayer.fl for SP/MP respectively, use visit = 1 to make a nav map item show, visit = 31 makes it show with a little info (not what is sold etc) and visit = 41 makes it show like you've landed there).
<br />
<br />#3 see newbie questions threads by chips and accushot or mail me
<br />
<br />#4 see adv battleship encounters (dl on this site) and tweak and chances to your needs.
<br />
<br />#5 working on similar idea for my own mod - mail if you want some samples
<br />
<br />#6 again working a similar idea (factions are 'fun' to make but it's all good). Encounters aren't so bad but test VERY regularly in every system you mess with <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />#7 easy to do (see #3)
<br />
<br />#8 the bots idea is impossible
<br />
<br />#9 mess with initial_world.ini, empathy.ini to change how factions react to your actions
<br />
<br />#10 new random mission types aren't possible. Flying against BS as a solar is possible and can make then fire back in SP game (mail me for a script). It's possible to substitute BS for fighters but messy due to size and them spawning all kinda overlapping each other
<br />
<br />#11 go for it! how about regular 'Jed Bush' hunting missions <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />#12 only possible in SP story scripted mission.
<br />
<br />I'll help where i can but have other projects too so don't get stressed if i can't work to tight time scales!

			<div class="content">#10 is solvable... just mess with formations.ini, and make sure that the Formation that the Encounter uses gives enough room between ships when they spawn.  It is technically feasible to spawn a battleship with dozens of fighters around it that works.  The devil is in the details- the best way to manipulate this is via the weights and the time-before-next-wave functions, so that from a player's perspective, the battleship and the fighters arrive almost simultaneously.  But I'm sure it can be done.
<br />
<br />As an alternate route, you can make battleships destroyable solars like they are in FL SP.  This is rather boring as they won't move or manuever, but it works just fine...
<br />
<br />As for the specific balancing steps... I truely wish you the best of luck here.  I've long been waiting for somebody to do a FL MP mod that used FL ships... and was balanced properly for PvP MP.  Suggestions:
<br />
<br />1.  You can lose most of the weapons right off the bat, or simply make them non-lootable so that the only ones players can buy are balanced.  This would greatly simplify your job.
<br />
<br />2.  When doing the initial balancing steps, it's wise to work from one model of ship and then make variations according to mission profile.  For example... make a test VHF and then playtest with it for several hours, and make little notes to yourself.  Always bear in mind that while the AI can shoot more accurately than people ever do, that even the &quot;ace&quot; AI is a really terrible opponent compared to even one medium-skilled player... and don't consider your balance done until you've set up a server and gotten other people to try shooting you down- you'll learn a lot more that way.  If you're not very skilled (be honest with yourself)... find people who are, and ask their opinions- they'll probably surprise you.
<br />
<br />3.  You can make the FL AI a <i>lot </i> more challenging than it is now.  Go download my mod (Warriors of the Sky) or get the Deathwish AI mod (written by Warzog) to see what a halfway-challenging AI-vs-human experience can look like.
<br />
<br />4.  When balancing ships, bear in mind that you'll have to use special tricks if you want to do things like custom thrusters which only one ship can have- for the most part, things like thrusters can be used by any ship.   So what you've got left is speed, acceleration, shields, power, armor, cargo, thrust capacity, thrust refresh, shield refresh, weapon hardpoints, and more specific technical issues such as weapons placement.  Given that you're working with stock FL models, you'll just have to work around what's already there, which is good, bad and middling in various places.
<br />
<br />At any rate... good luck.  Keep reading the materials posted on the Editing Forums, and if you get stuck (and have tried reading the Tutorial materials and Newbie Questions threads)... don't hesitate to ask around.</div>

			<div class="content">I have tried to make the ship balancing part of this mod but all that I can get is a folder in my freelancer mod manager with some modified notepads from the game data files that don't do anything in the game at all. I tried turning trent into a robot but it failed. I also tried adding another zero on the end of the patriots armor rating and giving it level 10 guns but it also failed I tried looking in these forums on how to make a mod and each time I made changes It still didn't work and I dont even know where to start on battleship encounters, new missions, and pretty much all that I had in mind. And I'm really disappointed to hear that I can't  pirate a bot without blowing the ship to pieces everytime and not have a chance to say drop your cargo. I can't make a mod so if you decide to officially start it tell me here. and I'm thinking about having all corsair ships on crete and all outcast ships on their homeworld too. also the startrackers on manhatten and denver should be replaced with a starblazer and a starflier so that their available.</div>

Then save all the pages (i know there's 70 odd) of newbie and newbie2 threads from General Editing Forum to your computer. Get some coffee, biscuits, whatever to keep you happy while you read. If you make it halfway through the first one whithout modding something simple that works i'll be suprised. Start small (don't run before walking). Good luck and enjoy yourself mate!

<br />Well, I hate to break it to you... but if you want something, you've gotta be prepared to go and make it yourself.  Most of us who're good at modding (not me, I just muddle through) are busy working on their own projects, and aren't likely to help.
<br />
<br />That said... if you want to play a SW mod SP, I strongly recommend Tie Universe 2.1, which you can find by doing a search of the News.  It's full of great SW content, and is a lot of fun to play <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">I haven't tried (yet) but it should be possible (as for almost all MP mods, with respect to Arghs WOS) to hack Xerex's OpenSP for a single player game. 
<br />
<br />I think you will find that learning to mod is worth the effort - i remember what it's like to stare at code for the first time and not understand (Sinclair BASIC and z80 assembler on my ZX81 at age 11 in my case lol) but it gets easier if you're prepared to stick with it and write things down for later reference <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Edit : 10 minutes later... Freeworlds OpenSP done and tested. Mailing it your way.

			<div class="content">Another good Idea for my mod is a new startup menu screen. Ever get bored of looking at ships just flying by? I think the game needs a new menu screen with a Nomad battleship just to the upper right from the middle of the screen at a slight distance away and the camera is just on top of a liberty battleship turret making it look like a cameraman is standing on top of a turret but doesn't move with it. Both of the Battleships are stationary and invincible but there are many fighters having a battle between the ships which are both nomad and Liberty. To top it off is a black hole far away with bright spinning clouds slowly swirling around it and every 15 seconds it gives off bright gamma ray bursts.
<br />I also have a good idea for a system located far away on the universe map but it is connected to a hidden jump gate in the Denver system. the Jump gate takes you to a world with no civilians or even freelancers. Just the Liberty Navy and Nomads. the Order is there too. I don't know how to post a picture here so i'll try to describe it. the entry point is at the jump gate at the very farthest of the lower left side of the map. trade lanes form something like a bracket from the jump gate to the right 75% across and 75% up from the jump gate. At the top of the top lane is a planet controled by Liberty Navy and sells Juni's Defender and the original Defender. the top right has a non-dockable Nomad controlled planet and has jump gates to all story mode only systems and the top of the unknown system.there are wrecks scattered in between the nomad and Liberty planets and one of them is special (you can tell because this defender is next to the nomad planet) It has a cloaking device and all of it's laser hardpoints have missle launchers that only take up energy but with all of them on you can only fire one per energy recharge and only heavy/very heavy fighters have that much energy. the ship was carrying a power generator called the atomic can but it's not useable and is put in your cargo hold but it's worth a lot!.above the liberty planet is a gas cloud and another one hides the Osoris in the lower right one a little ways from a Liberty base being built at the end of the trade lane. there is a blue Giant in the center on the system but it's not radioactive. If it is possible to make Gravity I would like a black hole on the farthest right from the middle of the screen but it's not necessary.</div>
