			<div class="content">Hi i'm just starting in this mpodding buniese and i jsut want to start small and i need help with how to change the ship's prices and how to make the AIs use their bots and have shield regen
<br />
<br />i already have SDK downloaded and loaded i also have the freelancer misc. data base downloaded and i think i got a hang of editing the price of ships and weapons but just need a more detailed walkthrought <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and i'm still tryiung to find a turtoial for making AI use their bots and have shield regen
<br />
<br />This is a very big bench mark for me as i decided to become a game programmer and i think that FL (with most of its files in *.ini form) is easier to eidt and i wanted to start really small b4 i do anything drastic.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance</div>

			<div class="content">Wow - I respect you!! You started like me, easy and small, and will slowly progress, unlike the average person that storms in here and says &quot;I want to remake FL, help me now&quot;, and then gives up 10 minutes later.
<br />
<br />Anyway, look in the tutorial section for the AI sheild regen and using bots/bats. I found a tutorial there, and it works all as it should for me. I think it's in the compilation thread, along with alot of easy-ish things that you can start out with.
<br />
<br /> As for ship prices, theres two ways you can do this:
<br />
<br />1) Find your way to DATA\EQUIPMENT\Goods.ini , and scroll down past the commodity listings. Right beneath there should be good entries as such:
<br />[Good &lt;------------ This square bracket is closed, as you can see in the .ini files, but this site won't let you close them <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />nickname = lf_hull &lt;-------------------Nickname, is how the game recognises individual entries. The nickname must be unique
<br />category = shiphull &lt;------------------What the good entry is. In this case, as you can see, it's the hull of a ship. I'd be worried if it wasn't!!
<br />ship = li_fighter &lt;--------------------This is saying what ship hull this good entry is referring to. If I'm right in remembering, li_fighter is the patriot. I think these are in the misc. database, but I'm not sure....
<br />price = 7500 &lt;-------------------------This is what your after, the cost of the hull.
<br />ids_name = 12001 &lt;------------ids_name and ids_info are things you will see alot around the .ini files. They are the names you will see in the game, ids_name is the name, ids_info is the infocard. However, these are more comlicated and will take awhile to explain so I wont go through it here.
<br />item_icon = Equipment\models\commodities\nn_icons\li_fighter.3db &lt;------This is the little icon picture you see by the ship when you buy it/sell it (in the shipdealer screen). There is one individual one for every ship in the game (except maybe some un-buyable ones). There is a tutorial around here somewhere explaining how you can make your own, and they use the same idea for commoditites (and weapons/equipment too, I guess).
<br /> 
<br /> Yeah, see the price = listing? Thats what you want. Change that, and hey presto, your ship hull costs however much you changed it to to buy (the sell price will change to, not sure how much though).
<br />
<br />2) Find market_ships.ini in DATA\EQUIPMENT. There will be lines like this under headers of bases - the bases are nicknamed as Br01_01 (Planet New London), Li01_01 (Planet Manhatten) etc., you can find these in the misc database.
<br />marketgood = gf1_package, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1
<br />It's the numbers your after this time. Ignore them all except the last one. The others indicate what level you must be to buy the ship, what reputation you need and whether it's sold on the base or not. The very last one indicates the price multiplyer. The price is defined in Goods.ini, like I said above.
<br /> So, if you change the last number to 5, it will be on sale for 5 times the amount listed in goods.ini, change it to 10, then it'll be 10 times the amount, etc.
<br /> On default, everything in the game (except commodities, to give a market <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) is set as 1.
<br />
<br /> There you go. There is another way, in which you could set the price of equipment and mount that on the ships package, but thats more complicated. You will probabaly learn that in time, as I did.  
<br />
<br /> bear in mind though, that the ships hull is not the only thing you buy when you buy a ship, so the price will most likely be more than what you said. All the equipment that comes with the ship also counts towards it's selling price.
<br />
<br />Hope that helps, any questions, just ask.
<br />
<br />L.D.
<br />
<br />P.S. I hope someone else didn't reply in the time I was typing this!!
<br />
<br />EDIT:: Yay, I got in first!! Anyway, edited spelling, and added notes on the Goods.ini example (If I droned on a bit on some of them, then sorry)

			<div class="content">Also, If you plan to be a game programmer professionally (Make Money at it), you need to plan on a Double Major in Math and Computer Science with a heavy emphasis on calculus and statistical mathematics and a minor in Computer Graphics.  Also, forget having a social life.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, take it slow and learn at your own pace.  But know this:  Freelancer is one of the most flexible game engines I have ever seen so not all games give you this much access without programming knowledge.
<br />
<br />Good Luck and go after it!

			<div class="content">heh thanks for the help and comment Leathal Dosage i'm sure that there is is command somewhere in FL that makes it so that the sell price is porpostional to the buy price (like the command that is sellprice = (buyprice)*1/3 , makes the sell price 1/3 of the buy price although they probelly have a diff name for it)
<br />
<br />To Glock36
<br />Yes i did know that i went to a unversity information night (forced by my parents since i'm only in gr.9 but its when i set my life path to game programming/designing) and i got the infomation on unversity of Waterloo (Canadian unversity, btw i'm a chinese immigrant in canada, a canadian now <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) i'm prepared to the courses as i'm in IB (International Baccalaureate), its a advanced learing programe that will get me finish most of my high school career in grade 11. In grade 12 i will able to take advanced courses like theroies of knowledge (to some colleges and unversities they will take 1 year off your course if enrolled but Waterloo don't let me do that <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) i'm very, very artistically challenged and i'm spelling channelged (being a immigrant.............) but i think i can cope with it and hopefully when i do start to programme i would have an art team making the art for me lol. Also i think that i don't really have a life now lol <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Edit: Leathal Dosage i cannot find a tourtial about the AI nano and shield usaage and shield regen in the tourtial with the search (forum) and search (with my firefox browser) can ya provide a link?

			<div class="content">TheHolyLancer, 
<br />
<br />I spotted your post while trying to get a sense of modding by reading the forum, there's a lot to learn, and most of the stuff you have questions about have answers in the posts.  Use the search for subjects.
<br />
<br />There are quite a few serious mods available that are very well balanced and very complex.  These large mods, there's a listing in the forum, are a goldmine of information on what can be done with FreeLancer.  I would suggest that you try some of the big mods, not the one shot addons, and get a feel for changing the game.
<br />
<br />Again, read the forums, the info you want is there.
<br />
<br />Good luck
<br />
<br />

<br />     Some say &quot;The  problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard&quot; 
<br />     I say, &quot;Actually, the problem is too many lifeguards and not enough F___ing chlorine&quot;</div>
