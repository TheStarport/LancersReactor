			<div class="content">The planet of Leeds, like some others in Britonian space, always looked so dismal. It never seemed to stop raining, and he human traffic, never looked....well, healthy if you know what I mean. A young friend of mine, Richard Tobias was a prime example. Richard was only after the fast credit. He would take advantage of who ever he could, when ever he could. His principle, well lets say he had some, but they were of little importance to him. He told me, every time I reminded him of them, that if they could not make him rich, he had no use for them.
<br />
<br />Richard and I made a good team though. His brawn and my brain, we made a good team. He had contacts we needed to turn quick profits. I had the persuasiveness needed that I could turn the heads of most men. Richard always said it was a crock, but I would remind him who my partner in business was. He would grin at the though and let the matter drop.
<br />
<br />Our main contacts always set up a monthly meeting on Freeport one. I was not beyond a little smuggling, if you take my meaning. Diamonds were the quickest to b ring profits, but were a risk due to every pirate around. For that reason, I flew a heavy armed freighter and Richard flew medium grade fighter with cruise disputers on it. That way if we were jumped, he could hit their ships and then we jumped and they couldn&#8217;t follow us. It worked most of the time with only once having to dump the load to escape. 
<br />
<br />That mission went haywire from the get go. I had a bad feeling in the bar, where we met the buyer. He said he would only pay up for the merchandise in hand. I always required the credits up front. But Richard wanted to do this, saying that he was willing to pay higher than the going rate. That alone should have been the tip off. 
<br />
<br />At the location we were to transfer the cargo, we were jumped by the contact, and about ten of his buddies, at least those we could count. Richard fired the disputers, but I dumped the diamonds and took off for the fringe area and met up later at the emergency base on Freeport seven. I was steaming at Richard for this and told him never again, would I trust his contacts. He apologized profusely, and said he would make it up to me. 
<br />
<br />We met up later in the bar. After a few drinks, we headed for my room. Richard always was a smooth talker with the ladies, and I was no exception, with a few drinks under my belt. He and I had a very good night, and lets say, we had some memorable moments too. 
<br />
<br /> Less than a week later, I learned someone had put a bounty on my head, half a million credits. What for, I have no idea. We never really made enemies with anyone, well other than the outcasts. I told Richard, I was going to take some time away from the business and head to Hawaii and lay low for a month or so. He said he would look into who put the contract out on me, and see what he could do to make it go away. 
<br />
<br />Little did I realize how much that night together would change both me and Richard. I never made it to Hawaii, but had to keep running. That and staying sick for a month, I was miserable. But, it was almost a year till I saw Richard again. The bounty, for whatever reason was now one million credits, dead or alive. Who ever I ticked off, wasn&#8217;t going to just forget about it and go away.
<br />
<br />I finally got into contact with Richard, and had him meet me on Sprag. Nothing was there, but rock and emptiness. I arrived in a heavy fighter that I had acquired from a close friend while on the run. But what I was about to leave Richard, well lets say he wasn&#8217;t prepared at all, and his jaw about hit the ground at the revelation.
<br />
<br />He sat beside me on the wing of my ship. There was a basket I kept close to my side as we talked. He told me, his contacts still had not found out who put the contract out on me. I told him I was going to disappear permanently, to end our working relationship. This stunned him, but not nearly as much as the next thing. I slid the basket over to him and said that I was leaving a prize possession with him. He peered into the basket and saw a baby boy, sleeping soundly. A missile detonation could have not been as loud as the word he spoke, seeing the child. I told him, that Yes, the child was his, and mine. I said I gave him a first name, but would leave it up to him to give the boy a family name. 
<br />
<br />He asked the name I chose. I said, his name is Edison.
<br />
<br />
<br />Twenty years later.
<br />
<br />Richard had just bought space on the planet of Leeds. He had had just about enough of the freight running business to last a life time and decided to settle down and run a legit business. He knew the trade good business inside and out, but decided on weapons and defense&#8217;s instead. There weren&#8217;t too many pilots in this day and age that weren&#8217;t looking to upgrade their ships. He used his contacts to buy low and sell high. He did however, begin to develop the reputation of a honorable man, who stood behind what he sold. 
<br />
<br />A customer who had just purchased batteries and nanobots for his ship, was just lifting off the platform when a customized Humpback freighter landed. This one was a little longer than the standard model and had the power system for a heavy fighter. It had the look more of a blockade runner, than a freight hauler. This brought a smile to Richards face, but he quickly hid it from the pilot. As the man climbed out of the ship, Richard turned and went back into his shop. He had to get the next order ready for shipment. This pilot would be the man who delivered it. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tobias, Tobias where are you old man?&#8221; came the voice that contained a slight humorous tone.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Keep your voice down, Edison and get in here&#8221; the tone having an edge of anger to it. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;How many time do I have to keep reminding you, I go by Trent now&#8221; the youth spoke, squaring his shoulders. He and Tobias had this discussion every time Trent returned from a long delivery. 
<br />
<br />Tobias just shook his head at the boy. He was getting more head strong than ever before. Tobias decided it was time to slow the youth down a notch. &#8220;Come in here and have a seat my boy&#8221; and he indicated the seat across from his desk. &#8220;There&#8217;s something we need to talk about.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent saw the look on Tobias&#8217;s face. It was that time again, the serious talk they had every so often. There was no getting out of it, so Trent just sat and looked glum. 
<br />
<br />I call you Edison, because it&#8217;s your name&#8221; Tobias began. He reached for the bottle on the shelf behind the desk, and poured himself a drink. He downed the whole glass in one gulp. When the burn died down, he looked wryly at Trent, &#8220;Yes I know you never liked the name Edison, but its time I told you more of why you have it, and why I keep calling you by that name.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The look on Tobias&#8217;s face, bothered Trent. He never saw Tobias this worried. He knew that something was up lately, but never could figure it out. Whenever he brought up the situation, Tobias would change the subject. Now it seemed it would be brought out into the opening, and he could find out just what was troubling Tobias so much.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You remember back when you were a wee lad about five years old or so?&#8221; he asked. Trent nodded his head. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;You told me you had found me left behind on the landing platform and sent me to live with your Aunt Crystal Trent, and decided to give me that name.&#8221; Trent replied. &#8220;You said I must have been an orphan and you would take me in after I got an education.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, there is a wee bit of truth in that, but now, is time for the whole truth.&#8221; Tobias look exremly uncomfortable as he continued. &#8220;The truth is, your mother named you Edison and told me that I could choose to give you a family name, just before she left.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Before she left, you mean ou met my mother, that she left me with you?&#8221; Trent sat up straight. 
<br />
