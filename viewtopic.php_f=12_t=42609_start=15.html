			<div class="content">I agree with Cold Void on this, he has hit the nail on the head about Global Warming.
<br />
<br />Concerning Plastics, I was considering the same conumdrum earlier but the more I thought I about, the more I realised it is was less of an issue that one might think.  There is very few plastic products in existance to which there isn't an alterntive for them.  Indeed, Plastics are a recent invention that have found their way into every home, but virtually every plastic can be built with other materials (metals, paper and ceramic being the main three).
<br />
<br />And the other thing is that the problems of being without plastics is a short term problem only once (and if) space exploration gets under full swing and we start exploring properly the rest of our solar system, there is solutions at hand.  Most plastics are made up of Hydro-Carbons (if I remember my chemistry days at college correctly).  This means essentially, plasitcs are a composition of Hydrogen and Carbon atoms, sometimes with a few oxygen atoms chucked in for good measure.  Hydrogen and Oxygen are easily obtainable (Electrosis again from water, not only from this planet as we know ice is abundance in the solar system) and astronomers have figured out many of the asteroids in this solar system are mostly carbon based.
<br />
<br />Off course, one could also use the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen gained out there to synthesis oil and petrolium as well, but by the time we could do that, the only use out of oil will probably be as a lubricant as we will have turned to other fuel sources by then.
<br />
<br />But back to the topic of the thread (and all this intrinsically connected), I will re-illiterate a point I made earlier, I wonder if the oil companies realise that the oil is running short (whatever side of the fence you sit on with the Global Warming issue, no one can refute that there is only a finate about of oil locked up in the Earth's crust) which is why prices are rocketting, especially with increased demand from countries that are catching the rest of us up (like China).  Very few scientists will tell you that if we continue to use oil like we do that it will last more than the next 100 years, and if demand is increasing.... well, thats even less time left.
<br />
<br />Again, scientists are in disagreement as to how many years we have left, but predictions are between 5-75 years left of oil at the current rate.  And as much as we may think about how we survive today with high prices for petrol in our cars today (I am not a car owner, I use public transport as much as possible and half the buses in our city are on gas power instead of diesal - not that it is really much better as there is only so much gas as well), I have to consider even more the world off tomorrow for my children as well in which oil and petrol will no longer exist as a consumer product.  If the higher prices is them funding research into alternative power sources (I know Shell and BP do carry out scientific research into alternative power sources) I have to ask, is some discomfit in higher prices today going to make a better future for my kids tomorrow?
<br />
<br />But another thing to throw into the mix, completely of the conservation track but another possible cause of higher prices is the knock on effect of every disaster that occurs in regards to oil.  In 1991, Sadam Hussain in his temper over the Allied Forces increasing victories against him, set fire a large number of oil wells in Kuwait and caused one of the largest oil spills in history into the gulf.  My father was there onboard a Royal Naval Mine Hunter and he brought back footage on a camcorder that I have watched repeatidly of events in the gulf (this is the uncut stuff you don't see on the News).  Despite whatever the news broadcast at that time (and I remember it well), it was nothing compared to the uncut stuff.  The coast was no where in sight for the ship, yet the oil spill was so bad that the part of the gulf they sailed through looked solid and the sky, in the middle of the day at the equator, was black with oil smoke.  One wonders how much was lost that year by the oil companies, not just in oil, but in production facilities as well.  And how much does insurance companies pay out for losses incurred thanks to war, remembering the insurance bills against terrorism were only set up by insurrance companies shortly before 9/11.  And even if insurance was paid, that will bump the oil companies premiums up considerably.
<br />
<br />It is not the only disaster either to hit the oil companies in the last 15 years.  Several more tankers have run aground and the companies not only have to try and claim back on insurance for the lost goods (not to forget that each one bumps the premiums up a little higher) but also are obligated to help fund the clean up operation.  Parts of the Welsh coast are only now being declared clean once more after a tanker spilled it contents several years ago.
<br />
<br />And if you want an example of another oil disaster in the last 15 years, what about accidents at oil refineries?  If you think they don't happen or are minor, think again.  Late last year, one of the largest oil refineries in the UK caught fire in Hemel Hamstead.  The entire refinery was wrecked, most of the drums ended up on fire and fire fighters struggled for days to bring the blaze under control.  The smoke produced by it was occasionally visable to west of my own hometown, over 100km away from the source of the fire.  Considering Britian is one of the many countries that has a large oil comsumption and that it was one of Britians largest refineries gone, that is even more oil lost and oh look... premiums with the insurance companies will have risen again.
<br />
<br />I am not excusing it, don't get me wrong, but I am throwing ideas into the pot as to reasons.</div>

<br />I live in Wisconsim with a wood burning heater as a primary heat source for the house I live in- do you have any idea as to the time involved to cut your fuel for an entire winter? Or, should you choose to go this route, to pay someone to cut the wood for you? and, since it is a subject currently near and dear to my heart-do you really want to go charge the damn thing at 1:00 AM?
<br />
<br />I will return also- the speculation over 'microwave beams' being able to be turned into a weapon is valid- a human can turn ANYTHING into a weapon- but according to the studies( years old- apologies!) the density of the beam from an orbiting SPS wouldnt be enough to fry anything- unless it decided to stand there for around a day or so. And, we're talking about a beam around a meter or so at the output end- NOT at the recieving end, which would experience significant spread. The original studies proposed rectenna farms  around 10 Sq Km.....</div>

<br />
<br />As far as oil company profits go, I can see where you're coming from and agree that these are stupidly large profits to be making.  Shell is currently making &#163;35 million a day .  However, you have to realise that in x years when the fuel supplies run out Shell and co. are going to be up sh1t creek without the proverbial paddle.  Oil is becoming an increasingly precious commodity and they are making use of that fact to raise prices; it's simple business tactics and they seem to be working out very well.  When the oil supplies run out these companies are going to take a massive hit; not just from lack of income but from the costs of decomissioning oil rigs and redundancy pay for the thousands of workers they'll have to lay off.  
<br />
<br />In addition, Shell is facing massive cost overruns in trying to extract oil and gas from Russia, from Nigeria where corruption is rife and it's workers are being murdered and kidnapped, and the Gulf of Mexico where hurricanes are causing massive damage to their platforms.  It doesn't justify another price increase of such size, but as oil supplies dwindle it is going to become far more difficult and expensive to extract.  
<br />
<br />If it makes you feel any better, remember that in a few years Shell, Exxon and other members of the &quot;evil oil empire&quot; will find themselves out in the cold with nothing but the shirt on their back.  And possibly a few billion in equity. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>burning fossil fuels in powerplants is stupid - but burning biomass is NOT - here's why:
<br />fossil fuels contain carbon from millions of years ago, you know ... the 'carboniferous' era?well, that means you have a one-way release of energy, no return cycle involved
<br />whereas renewable fuels(biomass) thrive on their own pollution(co2) and duh-duh-duh-duh!-solar  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />OK, I'm not at all sure what you're trying to say here.  There is of course a return of energy from burning fossil fuels; it's taken up by photosynthetic organisms as CO2, saphorotrophic bacteria that break the carbon compounds down into component substances...all the same mechanisms that return carbon when burning biomass.  Carbon is carbon is carbon - fossil fuels are just biomass that has been converted into coal/oil by a number of factors over time.

			<div class="content">@Accushot: the point was that although we're dumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than normal(much more) there won't be an equalizing increase in biomass immediately due to agriculture and deforestation, climate change, and what may be a break down in the ecosystem caused by any number of factors. I can't quantify that, but i understand there are satellites that can actually measure global vegetation, and if there had been a huge increase in biomass due to the already elevated co2 levels it would be cited as counter evidence in talking points

			<div class="content">Yes, but that doesn't explain why burning biomass is better for the environment than burning fossil fuels.  The carbon is still being released and locked up in CO2, same as that released by coal-fired power stations.  The Carbon cycle is a closed system and as such no carbon, and hence biomass, is lost or gained whatever method you choose.
<br />
<br />Apologies if I've misunderstood what you are trying to say, but it sounds like you are trying to make a distinction between the effects of burning fossil fuels and living biomass. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />
<br />coal - is dirty,no matter how you cut it/refine it,it has a high trace amount of sulfur and other nastiness - oil, likewise, is dirtier than bio, and it has to GO somewhere - which is the atmosphere, where it warms the earth by trapping UV rays with its higher rate of diffraction than oxygen and nitrogen.this in turn, melts the icecaps and warms tundra releasing more greenhouse gas in the form of methane from anaerobic decomposition.
<br />
<br />lets say you grow some rapeseed and and you get 70% of its weight in oil. all of this goes into the atmosphere as co2 except what collects in the engine when you burn it.in order to replace that fuel, you must raise more biomass from co2 and soil, which will consume 100% of what you burned.voila! a closed cycle, maintained by supply and demand
<br />
<br />fossil fuels, are an accelerant to the natural cycle in that they dump carbon that was buried miles deep over hundreds of millions of years by geological forces into the atmosphere to be reabsorbed in the cycle, but as more co2 is vented all over the world the cycle fails to keep up and co2 begins to affect climate - just like flooding an engine, if you'll pardon my analogy <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Hehe, they post high profits - and?
<br />
<br />Shell don't control the price of fuel at the pump, not even slightly. Heck, they also don't control the price of oil itself. The price of a barrel went up due to &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;uncertain supply&quot; for something we all depend upon. Where? The middle east. Oil doesn't cost anymore to pump in Russia due to middle east worries/disruptions, nor does it in the US, South America, North Sea, Africa and pacific. The prices haven't gone up, its just that a reduction in supply from one area leads to a global increase in price. Are shell supposed to say &quot;we will sell at $35 a barrel still though&quot; - course not. They sell to the global market, not to individuals etc, so the price of crude per barrel isn't actually in their control is it? However, when they sell said barrel, they reap the rewards of its price being inflated by ourselves (the nations) whom depend upon it, and want supply even if it is falling below our needs.
<br />
<br />On the forecourt, the price of fuel is usually being sold by those oil companies at a slight loss, or just about breaking even - their profits are NOT derived from the &quot;pump&quot; - indeed, it's negligent, and not worth their effort thb - they'd probabily make just as much in a more streamline company if they sold off their garages and simply prospected for oil, and drilled/shipped it instead.
<br />
<br />The UK enjoys the lowest price of fuel in Europe BEFORE tax, but after tax (government) it is one of the highest. So whom is responsible for making it so damned expensive? It isn't the oil companies, that is for sure.
<br />
<br />I get a little sick of the media fed band wagon &quot;oh look at the profit, it's us they are milking to make such money, the evil pigs!&quot; They could sell the oil at a loss for us, so that it's a couple of pence cheaper I suppose, but does anyone here really think that a business should sell products at a loss just to ensure we enjoy it slightly cheaper? Would it actually translate to that either? BS would it, their would be an increase in tarriff for the garage (which makes a really small profit per litre) or worse still, MORE TAX.
<br />
<br />The oil companies have made massive profit due to oil supply uncertainties and global conflicts driving up the price of a barrel, and NOTHING to do with your local fuel station. Blame your own countries and governments for foreign policies, for tax burdens, and other such stuff instead - the record profits are due to THEIR actions instead. As it is, this country has talk of imposing windfall taxes on performing companies - which isn't &quot;balancing the books&quot;, but merely being opportunistic. Of course, you could say that is what Shell and others are doing, but is it really? They don't fix the price, and they will pump oil regardless of the price. If global supply is more sure next year, they will return significantly lower profits than this year - because their isn't the bumper $30 per barrel extra added on by global market panics and uncertainty.
<br />
<br />As for saving energy/renewable sources - the one thing pointed out that has been left out of the debate - simple things like light bulbs. Did you know that nearly 10% of the energy needs could be wiped out if people used energy saving bulbs at home? Massive difference, for such a simple and logical idea. We have 100% energy saving bulbs instead of the old tungsten filament bulbs in this house - but 95% of houses DON'T. Same with tv's on standbye etc, it ISN'T necessary, and wastes so much energy. Should we really be working damned hard to produce new technoloy, when simply employing existing technology could really help cut energy requirements, greenhouse emissions and more?
<br />
<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.banthebulb.org">www.banthebulb.org</a><!-- w --> - check it out, have a read, and turn the tv's off standbye, and change those bulbs!!
<br />
<br />(p.s - you may have noticed my personal feelings don't lean towards the oil companies - but that doesn't mean I support them, just in this particular instance that I completely disagree with attacking them for the prices you have to pay for petrol/oil. As it is, the companies can be very dirty indeed in their methods, but that is a completely different matter, and does not mean that therefore they should be forced to sell at a loss to us, without addressing the REAL cause (as i see it) of price problems!).

			<div class="content">good points about taxes, gas taxes are ridiculously high everywhere - and specially mandated regional gasoline blends that make the US look like a crazy quilt of red tape don't improve the situation here at least
<br />
<br />i have heard that LED lighting is even more efficient than flourescent, as well as enjoying a longer lifetime - and i have an LED flashlight that will light at full output on a 9v battery for a year straight- and its brighter/cleaner light when its actually dark enough to need it, very nice
<br />
<br />the way commodity's are bought and speculated on is the reason for dramatic fluctuations in gas prices, barring the local gouging at the pump - but the alternative would be mandating distribution politically, e.g WWIII :/

			<div class="content">If you want to read something fascinating about oil and the motives behind 'pipedreams' pick up a copy of <b>Taliban   </b> by Ahmed Rashid . The first half of the book outlines the development of the Taliban and their rise to power along with the chicanery of UNOCAL which 'dissed' Bridas Co. in Argentina. The second half of the book details the tapestry of relationships and betrayals surrounding the futile efforts to build pipelines and anything else in that part of Asia.
<br />   Rashid has reported for about 20 years on middle eastern affairs and has written articles for *lots* of well known publications like The Post, National Review, etc.. I think it was April, 1997 when he published an article on the development of petrolium resources in the middle east (he refers to it in the book) but I haven't been able to find it. It came out in The Far Eastern Economic Review . If anyone has seen it I'd be overjoyed to get a copy.

			<div class="content">I happen to have a copy that I'm not reading at the moment. I was already aware of the Unocal connection but not that it ran like a thread through every incarnation of power in Afghanistan. The ISI's involvement was also no big secret but I wasn't cognisant of quite how far Northern Paklistan had been *taliban-ised*
<br />
<br />If you'd like a copy I'll send you one. it's on &#163;2-99 special offer in the wife's book club.
<br />
<br />getting back to the point - this is a hugely important issue and one that will affect our lives in almost every concievable way, over time. The teens reading this will be our age in 20 years time which is the time scale for Dub's policy shift. If this goes the way it promises to go, they will live in a world radically different in energy usage than we have currently, a shift perhaps akin to the replacement of horse by steam, or steam by oil. Or maybe not?
<br />
<br />Will it be the dawn of a new age of technology, freed from the slavery to oil? Or is it all a big bluff, and really we'll just get oil from other previously unused or underused sources, with some nuclear reactors thrown in to take up the slack? I can't help but notice that Dubs specifically said that the purpose was to free the US from dependence upon oil imports from the Middle-East; which isn't the same thing as being reforged in the white heat of technology, is it?
<br />
<br />in 25 years I'll prob be safely dead so i suppose it shouldn't really matter to me, but I'd like my kids to grow up into a cleaner world where the climate isn't going to pot and foreign policy isn't dictated by a desperate struggle for resources.</div>

			<div class="content">TAW, I may need to clarify. I&#8217;ve read Taliban and recently loaned it to a student so unfortunately I can&#8217;t refer to it. Are you saying you have a copy of the Far Eastern Economic Review in which Rashid wrote about the state of petroleum resources in that area? It was this article (April, 1997 I believe) that he referenced in his book. If you have the article let me know where and how to send payment.
