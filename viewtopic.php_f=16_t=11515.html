			<div class="content">I see this thread occasionally....and makes me realize that there are people (just like me) who have had problems.
<br />
<br />Whether it's controlling the ship thru the rings, or some other problems.
<br />
<br />It irritates me when I see people saying stuff like &quot;Oh, That mission was SOOOOOO easy&quot; and stuff like that.
<br />
<br />Some people have a hard time keeping the ship under control like that.  I know I do...But since I passed that mission (By pure, unadulterated luck...Did not cheat) I have reflected back on that mission.  
<br />
<br />Here are my observations:
<br />
<br />1.  I have noticed that this game is harder to play with a trackball (and ultimatly more fun)
<br />
<br />2.  Hovus is a cheating (censored) (I know that's common knowledge)
<br />
<br />3.  People's common answer to cries for help about this mission is &quot;That was the easiest mission...Just hit Shift+W to go to cruise.&quot;
<br />
<br />That's all well and good...But if you are having trouble CONTROLLING the ship thru the rings...Knowing how to get to cruise is not going to help.
<br />
<br />Knowing to take the &quot;inside Track&quot; does not help either.  It's a CONTROL problem people.  Some people just can't control the ships in the game as well as others.
<br />
<br />4.  Flying a freighter is about the toughest way to beat Hovus...Especially the Humpback...That's a flying brick.
<br />
<br />I'm not picking on anyone in particular with my comments...I am just making an observation.  This mission is difficult for some people.  Don't be-little them by saying it was the easiest mission.  
<br />
<br />If anyone wants to make any comments about this...go right ahead...If the Moderators want to yell at me for making this comment...that's fine too.
<br />
<br />I just see this over and over again...with the same responses...which tend to be a little on the curt side....

<br />
<br />If you really have problems, purchase a light fighter for this mission. But it can be done in a heavy fighter, too (I did so).

			<h3><a href="#p110451" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">When I went thru the mission...I was using the Shift+W....But I was having trouble maintaining the course...Once in a while something would hit me and knock me out...but for the most part...I had trouble controlling the ship...and yes..a light fighter is a lot easier to control in there...but it is possible to fly it using something heavier...just a lot more difficult.   
<br />
<br />What I recommend is not only using the Shift+W...but also not over correcting...For people that are having trouble maintaining the course...
<br />
<br />I was also tempted to mess with the options...(Not hacking...Just the in game options) to try increasing/decreasing mouse sensitivity...Sometimes I know this may help...If you are over/under correcting....try changing the sensitivity settings.  If you are using a Trackball...This may help a lot...if you are using a mouse (Which in the ring mission is much easier), it may help too.
<br />
<br />If you are using a trackball...and have a spare mouse around...Try using that...
<br />
<br />This mission really is tough for some people...especially those that have trouble playing first person shooters....(New ones that require using the mouse)  
<br />
<br />I know with Jedi Outcast...If I wasn't watching how I moved my thumb, I would be swinging my lightsaber at the ground, and not hitting anything, while I was getting my rear end handed to me. 
<br />
<br />Part of my problem, was that the sounds kept distracting me, so I turned it off (It was by accident...Had put my son to bed...and meant to turn my speakers down...but turned them off by mistake)...It was a harried run....and my heart was racing....but I kept my concentration on the next ring....I know Hovus cheated...and stated shooting at me, or it was the weapon emplacements...Not sure...Was too busy watching the rings....(Shields were down, and half my hull was gone by the time it was over.....)
<br />
<br />It is still my least favorite mission...So I don't want to hear it was the easiest....Some people DO have trouble Controlling the ship...

			<div class="content">OK....Well...Black Dragon is an extreme case....But he proves my point....There ARE people out there (For whatever reason)  The normal &quot;Hit Shift+W after using the afterburners...and keep ahead of him&quot; doesn't work.
<br />
<br />So before you just post in here that standard comment....ASK what they are having problems with.  Please...Would save the original poster a lot of frustration.
<br />
<br />Because of that mission, I personally almost uninstalled the game and thru the CD out in the street.  The people in here, while trying to help...ended up being no help at all.  No offence guys...Some of us aren't as good as others, for one reason or another.

<br />Sorry, couldn't pass up the moment, Arg.
<br />
<br />Like Dragon, I have rheumatoid arthritis in my hands quite badly and I am only 26 years old (years of playing the piano and guitar way too much). My trick to beating the mission was a combination of things (in a Dromedary no less!).
<br />
<br />I cranked both the mouse sensitivty in Windows and in the game to max, hit the space bar so that I did not need to hold down the left mouse button. From there, it was just a matter of using small, incremental movements with my mouse (an Intellimouse Explorer Optical). I failed the first time out, had to watch that annoyingly insipid video again and won the second time through.
<br />
<br />Fully loaded out with nanos and batts was a REAL life saver.</div>

			<div class="content">Tip: Don't try to get ahead of him.  Sure, it can be done by flying the right line and maybe you're up for that kind of challenge, but... for the rest who just want to get past it, it's safer to be behind him.  Trying to pass him is a good way to get bumped off the course.  Being right behind him means you're in position to pass him immediately when he screws up.
<br />
<br />Course, the first time you race you don't KNOW he's going to screw up unless you've read the spoiler forum.  I wasted plenty of time trying to get the perfect launch so I could be ahead of him.  I'd quit the race and reload as soon as I realized I'd never catch him... which of course was well before the point he makes his mistake.
<br />
<br />Dumb mission.   Worst of the bunch.  Too bad, since it's quite differerent from all the other missions that involve killing people and breaking things.  Not that I don't enjoy those kinds of missions, but the change of pace could have been refreshing if it wasn't so frustratingly &quot;rigged&quot;.</div>

			<div class="content">I knew right off the bat it COULD be beaten...but some of us not not L33T at these kind of games...mediocre at best (Me included)  
<br />
<br />There was just no other option...Losing meant the game was over...and you had to restart the mission.  You just HAD to continue flying it until you could get thru it.
<br />
<br />However...getting there was the most difficult.
<br />
<br />I 150% agree...This mission was annoying, frustrating and SOOOOO many other words I could put here...but won't...to save space, but it was at the very least something different that go here, kill this, kill that sort of thing the entire game is...Which I am not saying that's a bad thing....But did they have to give the targets names?  Makes me think...What if that guy I just killed had a family....and I just killed thier daddy.....(Or mommy) Thier only means of support........
<br />
<br />Then I remember...It's just a game....
<br />
<br />That was a little off track, now wasn't it?
<br />
<br />Anyway...My theory was just proven then....If you alter the mouse sensitivity settings...it may become easier for people that are having the trouble with this annoying mission (SHould NOT be taken out by the way...) I might have to do that myself, to see if it gets any easier.....Hmmmm....

<br />Project for me.

			<div class="content">I'm one of the ones who didn't have so many problems. I just got up to it last night, and won by a slim margin on my first run through (or atleast I think it was a slim margin, I didn't notice him screw up or anything).
<br />
<br />I was flying a cavalier which made some of the cornering tricky later in the track, but I hit shift+w and space bar straight away out of habit. I kept mostly to his right, occasionally coming closer to the centre to give me more room to turn into a corner.
<br />
<br />Winning this race honestly isn't just about good mouse skills, infact they play very little into it because once you become acustomed to the sensitivity you dont move that mouse so much that it makes things over-complicated. Some experience at the more traditional racing games or even real live racing would DEFINATELY come in handy. Knowing that the best way to take a corner to start on the outside, cut across the inside and and end up on the outside after the bend is something that may come naturally to those who have done it before, but anybody who has never had any racing experience (in terms of control, not spectating) would struggle a lot more.
<br />
<br />Also trying to do this mission in a Cavalier (Bretonian Heavy Fighter) was already quite difficult due to some sharp turns near the end, so I shudder to think how ANY freighter pilots would have coped.
<br />
<br />Look around on the internet for racing tips. Luckily braking and acceleration aren't of any concern, but good cornering is critical. (That's where you pass him. I was ahead of him about 10 rings into it, and stayed there)</div>

			<div class="content">Am another who completed the run first time, but like above, was mostly blind luck.  I started out with afterburners, and when I saw him engage his cruise I kicked myself in the behind and started to engage my cruise.  He was quite a bit out in front for the entire race, untill he messed up, then I passed him and won in with the famous photo finish. (wish I could have had a screenshot from the side as we passed).
<br />
<br />     But as always, hindsight is nice, second time through had him at halfway point. Also I reversed the bump tactic on him, knocked him off the course. Agin more luck than actually trying to.  Too bad can't ram a cruise disruptor up his tailpipe.
<br />
<br />     Just my story, this is not a flame, but just curiosity, if you are having this hard of a time controlling your ship through a relatively static course, how do you keep control through some of the huge dynamic battles that take place, or if your only up to the ring race, are going to take place?</div>

			<div class="content">Hi, 
<br />
<br />its my first post here! Although I have read quite a few pieces of Info from this site I never came around to posting here <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Well, Mission 6, with that Sergeant.. My Roommate took 4 or 5 tries at that mission using the Dromedary and I decided to try it with a Light Fighter. Which I did... 
<br />
<br />The First time I tried it, I found out that the Soldiers start shooting at you and that Projectiles can throw you of the Track. Once that happens you already lost and can pretty much restart the race. 
<br />
<br />The Second time I tried it, I tried to &quot;stear&quot; into the ring before I reach it. Maybe like 500 to 800 Meters before you get to the next ring.. Start Steering in the direction which you have to go to reach the following ring. This way you are able to &quot;cut&quot; corners and get the better Flightpath. When the Colonel (whatever rank he is) tries to take the inside corner he will just eat your dust. 
<br />
<br />Once his Laky start shooting at you, start moving the mouse left and right and small cicles while flying.. This helps you in any combat if you want to dodge what they are sending after you... Makes you almost Impossible to hit by non-missle projectiles. I passed the mission on my third try I think, when I failed it the second time I almost broke my Keyboard. Its a very frustrating mission, which I found very sad aber the FL SinglePlayer... Missions are Frustrating like Hell! Wait till you have to Destroy the Tekaki War Planet... Or better AsteriodBase I should say... Boo! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Well I hope that helps!

			<div class="content">My mother had the shakes also, but to a great extent, could not ever imagine her trying to operate a mouse/joystick.  Guess thats what I picture when I hear about it.  Don't know what I would do if it got that bad for me, I love space/flight sims. Good luck with the mission.  Still would love to nail him with a cruise disruptor at race start, whould be quite funny.</div>
