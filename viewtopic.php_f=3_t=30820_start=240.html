			<div class="content">The reason microsoft and DA will NEVER make freelancer 2 is because Freelancer was a finacial failure. Granted, it was thier fault for improperly advertising it, but they aren't going to make a sequal to a finacial failure. It just isn't done.
<br />
<br />On the note of freelancer 2, since we probably can't call it freelancer 2 without getting slammed for copyright infringement, what alternate &quot;lancer&quot; names can you think of? SpaceLancer?
<br />
<br />IDEAS TIME! While we're waiting for our game engine, i thought that we could start solidifying what we want FL2 or whatever we call it. We can start creating content and decide on what we want FL2 to be like. One major thing is on the topic of randomized system creation. We have 3 options, one, its pure randomization, including the starting system (Of course, all systems have custom boundries and certain required elements according to the systems around it, etc.), Or we can have everything be randomized except the starting system, which can either be static or  be chosen from varies seeds (pre-built), Or, thirdly, we can have all our seed systems randomly spread out across our universe, and they can be gradually connected through randomly produced systems. The starting system would be one of those seeds, randomly chosen.
<br />
<br />Commodities, i believe, again are randomly generated according to the economics of the system and state or the surrounding systems. This brings up another point: Randomization, we're doing tons and tons of it in order to create a unique gaming experience every single time you play. It is not chaotic however, because it has rules, and it is intelligent. It randomly chooses from sensable possibilities, and you will not end up with an icey planet 50k from a star.
<br />
<br />On the note of ship and weapon creation, many would think that this would unbalence the game, but in fact it works in our favor. The way we do it is that you can create any weapon you want...as long as the technology is availible, along with the resources. Because of this, coupled with our randomization, each new game will be completely different. You could even end up with a combination of resources and scientific endouvers that creates extremely powerful weapons. But this doesn't unbalance the game. Why? Because of logic. If someone finds a new weapon, most likely they will share it. At least with their friends and faction. Therefore, the other factions would learn of it and aquire the weapon through espionage. Then everyone has the weapon. If a player has a weapon and is not giving it out (the game detects if it is good or not) then every now and then he will recieve requests from the various factions, asking for the blueprints for huge sums of cash. If these fail, soon he will be hunted and attempted to be forced to give up the gun, and if THAT fails, he will most likely be declared an enemy of the nation and attempted to be destroyed. In this manner, we preserve balance extremely well. Additionally, because of, again, randomness, you cannot count on anything but logic. A station won't always sell the same gun. But if its by the same resources, then there is a higher chance of it selling that gun because it makes SENSE.
<br />
<br />On to ship creation. Ship creation is very easy, and very easiely kept from being unbalenced. Because your in space (most of the time, sometimes you can do ground missions, especailly in newly colonized systems) the ship designs don't really matter that much. Except for stuff like weapon placement. You can create a very good design, but creating an ub3r ship is extremely difficult and only possible if you, again, have the resouces to do so. However, you will not be forced to give up your blueprints... usually. Pirate factions are always more likely to do stuff like that. The reason is that if a player sees your ship, they can copy it rather easiely. Having the blueprints wouldn't help much because if you don't have the resources, it wouldn't matter.
<br />
<br />As with charecter creation, thats easy. We'll probably end up doing something like EVE.
<br />
<br />On to gameplay, Just to make sure, i want to confirm that we all want to preserve the general idea of freelancer's missions, with a few changes (I.E. if you've been employed by the navy, the missions will instead give you a &quot;Bonus&quot; for doing them, therefore preserving their logic). And all those missions that you talked about wanting, we will have. Cargo, espionage, you name it, its in. I want to have a large variation of missions, so each type will have dozens of sub-types and possibilities. Not freelancers sad &quot;Their running!&quot; or there being weapon platforms. That gets old fast. The missions need to seem real, with the enemy doing unpredictable and sensable things. If their in an asteroid field, its possible they were expecting you and blow off your shields with a hidden explosive in a nearby asteroid. Or they have a base close by, and you end up having to blow the base up even though it wasn't in the job description (In cases like that however, they let you run away, since you didn't sign up for something like that. IF you do manage to do it, the appropriatly raise your pay for the increased difficulty). Sometimes the intel is completely wrong. Sometimes it might accidentally be a wild-goose chase (although these should be rare, as they can get frustrating if common). Maybe the guy wasn't ever there and all you did was blow up a clone. Each mission should be a mini-story. Some should take several gaming sessions to complete, with you unravalling the mystery of a dissapearing cardamine shipment, finding a corrupt official was behind it, then finding that you entered a trap, etc. etc. This greatly increases the re-play value because you can't ever be sure of whats going to happen. There are so many possibilities it would take forever to memorize them all.
<br />
<br />On the note of stories, we need someone to create a storyline for us, the challenge being to have it hint toward freelancer without ever actually mentioning or including any content that would warrent copyright infringement. Pull out your fanfics!
<br />
<br />Additionally, i'm rather certain we want to scrap tradelanes in place of a warp drive, such as EVE did, we can keep cruise for short distances and have a warp drive for longer distances, and then you would have a specail jump station to send you to another system, or discover a jump hole.
<br />
<br />Another thing, Realism. We need to figure out just how real we want this game, and whether or not that realism will impede the fun factor.
<br />
<br />Long post eh? Bring in the replies!

			<div class="content">Thx for the heads up. I agree with you on a lot of the above ideas. Since we've had Starlancer and Freelancer, we should keep the lancer but with something else, space-related, like Earthlancer or Skylancer (ok, their pretty rubbish, but i couldnt think of anything else). 
<br />
<br />But we don't want to make it too real so it spoils the fun, and we dont want to stray too far from freelancer/starlancer universe. I think several people should try and write stories for this new game (i wouldnt mind trying) and see the general opinion. 
<br />
<br />I definitely think commodities should be randomly created, but im not sure about the random system thing. 
<br />
<br />Ships could be created to user-spec, eg. you create a ship on what type of faction you are in, and what you want to create, depending on money. Also you should be able to join a faction and (wait for it) be in a wing or patrol. I dont mean controlling 7 ships, just you being a pilot in a group, like multiplayer, who you can be involved in and rise in command in a faction. 
<br />
<br />Factions could have wars in the game and missions could be longer, spanning several systems and with a wide range of choice - assassinate, recon, assault, hide from bounty hunters, capital ship stuff, and general shoot em-down. 
<br />
<br />Apart from that I agree with everything else. Please bring in ideas people!</div>

What probably will end up happening is some other company looking at freelancer and saying &quot;Thats a good idea&quot; And make a game based off of it, but with no real relation to freelancer.

			<div class="content">Ok, how i am going to make random systems is this: There are several major types of systems (Hopefully over 30, i want a LOT of diversity), such as 1 planet, 1 sun, 2 nebula. Or 5 planets, 2 suns, asteroid belt. Or even 1 Red Giant (If a star type has massive implications on a system, its given its own type), an old battlefield, and a black hole. It randomly chooses one of these after cross referencing the nearby systems, and making sure not to pick one that would mess with their properties. Then it will randomly select suns (from a large collection of sun types), randomly place them (Usually in the middle or corners, or if its binary, near the middle), do the same thing with planets, again cross-referencing their distance and properties of the sun so it doesn't choose a bad one. Then it randomly chooses a place in between planets (Perferably planets that are rather far away) to stick in an asteroid belt, then chooses randomly what kind of asteroid belt, like everything else. Finally, the economics are generated for planets (To determine that, if they are colonized, what sells well and buys well), what minable asteroid fields contain, and then, IF the system is populated by aliens, stick some bases and encounters in (this is rare). Lastly, jump holes are randomly placed and any other misc objects (again making sure they aren't too close to a planet or anything).
<br />
<br />After all this, a background is generated using info from the nearby systems to make it accurate (you will be able to see their correct sun colors, and possibly, if they're big enough, nebulas).
<br />
<br />I don't think i've left anything out...</div>

			<div class="content">It is great that you are making a sequil to Freelance and I look forward to playing it when in come out, though i know that is a long time away.  What blackhole2001 is saying is exciting but one thing a lot have people said they wanted is the abitiy to create their own faction.  I think it would be fun to create your own faction in a random system with a few planets and then when you become more powerful wage war with your own fleet.  You could keep your base a secret like the Blood Dragons show it to the universe.  If you keep your base a secret then less people would join you because logically the majority would know where you were. 
<br />At first you would have to build a name for yourself then people would want to join you.  Where one person goes by himself and kills for some cause and people have to go on long trecks to find him.  
<br />Also the fact the the more enemies that you make the hire the bounty is on your head and the more people will come after you. 
<br />Beside that i think your ideas are dinomite.  I would love to see this go though and become a game.

			<div class="content">Hey someone203, thats a good idea. It would be great to have your own fleet or wing of command, or a leader of a mysterious faction like the Order. But we dont want to be able to control the whole fleet like EVE, right?</div>
