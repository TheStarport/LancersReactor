<br />
<br />Just doing the occasional posting of reportage from the NY Times which may amuse you non-Americans.... and Americans too.
<br />
<br />While Congress and other State legislatures are pushing to enact &quot;cheesburger bills&quot; to prevent any more of these &quot;fat kids sue McDonalds for making them eat too much&quot; lawsuits, it would appear that the Tobacco law suit billionaire lawyers have decided to take a crack at it.
<br />
<br />*sigh*

<br />You cannot make these things up.

<br />Lawyers Shift Focus From Big Tobacco to Big Food
<br />By KATE ZERNIKE
<br />
<br />Published: April 9, 2004
<br />Lawyers who have made their careers defending the makers of breast implants, guns and tobacco are working from a new playbook. Make portions smaller, they advise food clients. Do not fudge the fat grams. Skip &quot;problem ingredients.&quot; And if a case goes to trial, choose jurors who go to the gym; avoid those who take diet drugs or support universal health care.
<br />	
<br />People may have laughed 16 months ago when obese teenagers unsuccessfully sued McDonald's, saying its food made them fat. But a well-honed army of familiar lawyers who waged war against the tobacco companies for decades and won megamillion-dollar settlements is preparing a new wave of food fights, and no one is laughing.
<br />
<br />Both sides seem undaunted by the &quot;cheeseburger bills&quot; wending their way through Congress. Personal responsibility, that legislation proposes, trumps corporate liability when it comes to being overweight. The House passed a bill in March that would prevent people from suing restaurants for making them fat, and the food industry has been supporting similar legislation, nicknamed the Baby McBills, in 19 states. But even proponents of similar legislation in the Senate say it is not likely to pass this year.
<br />
<br />And beyond those grounds, lawyers on both sides see broad potential for litigation, including challenges to the ways children are wooed toward sugar and fatty foods, deceptive labeling and misleading advertisements. While lawsuits in tobacco cases were filed before smoking was seen as a public health crisis, awareness about obesity is already high. The federal government calls obesity an epidemic and released statistics last month showing that it was close to overtaking smoking as the nation's No. 1 cause of death.
<br />
<br />&quot;The conditions are ripe,&quot; Alice Johnston, a lawyer in Pittsburgh, told about 100 lawyers and representatives of some of the largest food companies, including Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay, KFC-Yum Brands and Krispy Kreme, at a recent Washington conference on how to prevent and defend against new obesity lawsuits.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm old enough to remember when they first started talking about suing the cigarette companies and everyone thought it was a joke,&quot; said Joseph M. Price, a lawyer in Minneapolis who has defended the makers of breast implants and the Dalkon Shield birth-control device. &quot;Despite the fact that companies are saying this is all bogus and personal responsibility is what counts, I think the lesson we've learned, and that I would preach from my experience, is that you have to take the plaintiffs' bar at their word. They've said they're going to make this the next tobacco. If you go blithely along and ignore it, sooner or later it'll turn around and bite you in the backside.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lawyers cite 10 prominent cases against the food industry so far, five of which had some success. McDonald's paid $12 million to settle a complaint that it failed to disclose beef fat in its French fries; Kraft agreed to stop using trans fats in Oreos; the makers of Pirate's Booty, a puffy cheese snack, paid $4 million to settle a claim over understating fat grams.
<br />
<br />But both sides say they expect more. Defense and plaintiffs' lawyers have begun holding conferences to map strategy. The first for defense lawyers, in January, was so oversubscribed it had to be moved to a larger conference hotel. They say the next suits will not be traditional tort or personal-injury suits, largely because those cases are hard to prove. The defense can argue that the person suing should have eaten better foods, or exercised more, and that no one kind of cookie, hamburger or soda made someone obese.
<br />
<br />Instead, lawyers expect new cases to take on companies under consumer protection laws, accusing them of, say, advertising a product as low-fat without also mentioning that it is high in sugar and calories, or promising that a revamped product is &quot;lower&quot; in fat even though it is still not low-fat.
<br />
<br />Defense lawyers say companies are vulnerable to suits about misstating fat, calorie and carbohydrate content. They are advising clients to make sure to disclose all ingredients to avoid so-called Frankenfood cases, a specter raised by the judge in the McDonald's case, who said that most people would not expect Chicken McNuggets to have so many additives.

The Big Clothes industry perpetuates the unhealthy drive to be fat by hiding the shame of people's big appetites.  if people could no longer fit into their clothes, they wouldn't dare set foot out their door until they lost the poundage and could fit into their clothes.  And for those that wouldn't care, they would be rounded up like the cattle they are and sent to a fat farm.

			<div class="content">Im in agreement that food producers should be disclosing all of thier ingredients but fatties suing over it is another thing entirely. It's not like your 200 pound eating machine is going to give rats about the content of his/her next greasy hamburger. I mean you have to be mentally defective to think that it isn't going to cause you to gain weight.
<br />
<br />Still I have been thinking about suiing the automotive industry for providing transport that results in overall less oportunities to excercise. If it wasn't for cars i'd have a mean set of abs goddammit!! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">I would have thought that it could all be thrown out simply due to not being able to prove that they ACTUALLY ate there when they said they did, and also - there is no proof about what they ate the rest of the time. However, I do think that anyone suing Cigarette companies AFTER the warnings were put on packs should lose automatically, and i do think that these food cases shouldn't have even got NEAR court - simply because, unlike smoking, you DON'T stick to a single producer all your life (generally smokers smoke the same brand for life), which means who knows which food is more responsible?
<br />
<br />And finally - its about time we started taking responsiblities for our bodies, rather than blaming everyone or anything about our state of health. Sorry, but IF you do enough excercise to burn off the excess energy you eat, you cannot be fat - simple as that

			<div class="content">This just reminds me of that case where, coincidentally, this happened at McDonalds.  A woman spilled coffee on herself, got burned, and ended up suing McDonalds for millions.  And she won the case.  There's a thing called choice available.  You can eat too much and get fat, or eat moderately and excercise and stay thin.  But I guess within the legal system we're not capable of these decisions, so litigation is necessary.   Makes my head spin sometimes.   <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I am firmly with SS on this, i think i can count on both hands the amount of times in my life i have eaten at Macdonalds, and all other fast food joints on both hands. You pay alot, get sod all, and still feel hungry later as well. It doesn't taste anything LIKE beefburgers at all - which i would have thought would make people suspicious.....same with any chicken ones as well - they don't even have the right TEXTURE for decent chicken (it might be the chicken that is &quot;collected&quot; from the carcases after removal of most of the meat, you know - the bits that they blast off with high pressure hoses.......).
<br />
<br />I would rather pay a bit more and eat at a restaurant, OR just goto the local supermarket, buy half a kilo of mince for the price of a normal burger, make my own hamburgers that are 100% good meat, and STILL cost half the money. Best yet, they actually TASTE of meat...........whereas next time you are eating any Macdonalds food - try to think - does this actually taste like Beef? Or ANY meat that i have tasted before? Honestly - they taste only of strange flavourings - NO MEAT FLAVOUR!
<br />
<br />Sorry, i hate those junk food places.....its not food, and the only reason its &quot;fast&quot; is because its been precooked for you.....you don't actually know what your eating at all. (yes, i REALLY dislike all fast food joints - they are hideous).</div>

			<div class="content">Fast food has just be came the <i>&quot;excuse&quot; </i> for not taking time to cook. We get is too much of a hurry , trying to fit 5 things into a 1 thing area. Another reason I hate time management. I remember when I was a wee bit younger, when micky D's was a once every 2 weeks thing, if we were good. Other wise we ate at home, what mom put on the table. You didn't like it? You went hungry. I am learning to take the time to eat better and enjoy the time. Even <i>if </i>the boss is watching that I take my whole lunch hour. We need to slow things down and maybe, we could learn not to eat things, just because we saw it on TV with someone dressed as a clown. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">It depends a little on your metabilism. sw, your young, so yours is high. When I was 12-13 years old, I could eat 2x what my dad ate and not gain a pound. These days, if I so much as look at a slice of cheese cake, I gain a pound. Bummer ain't it. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
