			<div class="content">pah, these upstart states are nothing compared with the lost glory of Tawakalnia., now a shadow of it's former self, rotting under the misrule of Indy and his IFPP. How it's citizens remember with nostalgic pride the battles of the Great Patriotic War against Mustantopia! &quot;if only Comrade Taw where still here,&quot; old women sob, and old men mumble &quot;Ah, Comrade Taw would put this alright..&quot; Veterans of the Revolutionary Guard tell tearful stories of the glorious Revolutionary struggle in the vanguard of which marched the Dear Leader himself. Betrayed by his former Minister, Indy, who now leads the puppet Factorovian government (hence the letter F in the title of IFPP) aided by the sinsiter weapons created by Esquilax whom Comrade Taw once embraced to his bosom, the brave and noble Taw fled to save his people further bloodshed. In exile in Cuba with his loyal friend, Marshal Locutus, with only sensuous Cuban girls of scissor thighs and hourgalss figures for diversion, he shakes his head in sadness to see the misery under which his people now have to suffer...
<br />
<br />sorry that was totally not the point of this thread, but propaganda is loud and strident in the nations that follow Taw-ism. When I am eventually restored to power in the coming Second Revolution, there will be retribution to be heaped upon the heads of mine enemies. No disloyal too-clever sidekicks to detract from my one aim - to protect and extend the Revolution. This time there will be a total break with the past, a Year Null from which all things shall be reckoned anew. And those who choose to side with the past shall be cast aside with it. Fear not, Workers, Citizens, Soldiers, and Sailors, outside in exile Comrade Taw is assembling an Army of Liberation to free you from the usurper Indy and his sidekick Esquilax. 
<br />
<br />perhaps through the medium of Comrade Gromitov you could negotiate a peaceful surrender, if you truly care for the well-being of our people and seek not to bring them to harm?
<br />
<br />I never told you about the brainwashed sleeper assassin suicide ninjas that were left behind for such an eventually as this, did !? <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">*Independent News Network Flash Report*
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Ernst Wurmst reporting to you live from downtown New North Staffordshire....  This is where the bloodless coup took place.  In a surprise to
<br />all concerned, the Dictator Taklawana packed up and disappeared into the night as at what seems to have been the first indication that there may be rebellion in his ranks... Let's get a candid opinion from the average citizen on the street......Excuse me, madame, I'm with the INN news and, yes, you're on the air now, yes.  May we ask you a few questions?&quot;
<br />
<br />Woman:  &quot;Eh?  Me?  Well, I suppose you might do.  What's you're question?&quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;What do you remember best from the days when this was the USTR?&quot;
<br />
<br />Woman:  &quot;UST what?  Oh that.  You mean the PDRNS sweetie.  No one took that 
<br />Union thing very seriously.  I mean, Mustantopians becomig one of us?  What a laugh!&quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;Yes well.  PDRNS then.  What do you remember the best from those days?&quot;
<br />
<br />Woman:  &quot;You don't have to be so proper you know.  You can call it the P'RNS if you'd like.  What are we now?  Oh yeh, the IFPP.  Well.  For a start, I didn't feel the need to find a WC so often as now.  Every time I say IFPP.... oh dear..  Excuse me&quot;  *hustles off to nearest convenience*
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;You sir.  Excuse me.  Ernst Wurmst here of the INN on assignment to get the man on the streets point of view.  What do you make of all this?&quot;
<br />
<br />Man:  &quot;Wot? &quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;You know.  The change from the PDRNS to the IFPP, the downfall of Takwanalna and all that?&quot;
<br />
<br />Man:  &quot;Eh?  Change?  Oh.  Yes.  Well.  In the glorious days of the former USTR which only days earlier had been the PDRNS or as we locals called it, the P-R-.....
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;Yes- yes-yes go on....&quot;
<br />
<br />Man:  &quot;N-S....See the difference?  No D... we drop D's in our acronyms in these parts.   The train ran on time.&quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;Ah!  So it IS different already is it?  The railway system was better managed under the Tankawala regime was it? &quot;
<br />
<br />Man:  &quot;Eh?  No.&quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;But you just said that the trains ran on time and now they don't.&quot;
<br />
<br />Man:  &quot;Eh?  No.  I said the train ran on time.  That's all.&quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  &quot;And what's the difference then?&quot;
<br />
<br />Man:  &quot;Oh tha's easy!  In the days of the P'RNS ...see what I did with the D? ....we had but the one train and it was any one's guess what time it would arrive.  We all used to stand around and say, 'It'll be any time now!'   Now days we have two trains and they both run regularly about a half hour late.  It's quite an improvement really&quot;
<br />
<br />EW:  *Stepping in front of camera for full on face shot*  &quot;Ernst Wurmst from New North Staffordshire... back to you Beryl&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">New North Staffordshire Gazette:
<br />
<br />Committee to Create the Commission to Investigate Corruption in the Old Regime Set to Convene.
<br />
<br />Dateline:  Cubicle of Tawakalna, New North Staffordshire, IFPP
<br />
<br />The new government announced its first post-Tawakalnian reform by announcing the creation of a multipartite Committee to constitute a commission to investigate the corruption in the old regime.  To date, an ad hoc  council of truth seekers, headed by the First Protector himself, has uncovered evidence of a vast scheme to line the Dictator Tawakalna's pockets with the fruits of the tireless toil of Plebians and Patricians alike.
<br />
<br />Indinsky 1, the 1st Protector, was overheard to say:  &quot;Is this mike on?  Good.  My friends and fellow truth seekers, today marks an important day.  We lower the thick veil of deceit and corruption that was Tawkalnianism and cast the pure light of Indinskypian honesty upon this shabby tale.  No doubt we only have begun to uncover the tip of this festering iceberg of villainy and craven but ignorant greed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Today alone, we have found 20 tons of SPAM secreted in and about the so-called 'Uncle's' home.  Meanwhile, the nation was told to do without this luxury.  Already, our new trade commissioners are looking to find a buyer to salvage this disaster.  The invoices show that this 'Uncle' paid at 150% above the top price, per can for this .... meat.  We fear, unfortnately that at best we will be able to recoup a third of the price to restore to the Federation treasury.   
<br />
<br />&quot;Also, we now are confronted with over 1,000,000 cheap plastic green fuzzy monkey/frog purses.  The invoice for these things would have us believe that the National Treasury paid over $1Bn, that's over a $1,000 per purse for these ... objects.
<br />
<br />&quot;These instances and many others have brought us all to the conclusion that a Commission must be formed to continue these inquiries in a more formalized and routinized fashion.&quot;
<br />
<br />The First Protector continued to list other discoveries that demonstrate that the former Dictator, the reviled &quot;Taw,&quot; engaged in pointlessly extravagent and useless acquisitions of anything available at top price that no one else would buy, much less accept as a gift.  The look of shock and horror on the faces of the Truth Seekers could not be but undisguised and genuine as this writer, too, was rendered speechless by the degree of buffoonish spending that had been revealed.
<br />
<br />This new Commission will have yeoman's work cut out for it.

			<div class="content">&lt;MEMORANDUM&gt;
<br />To:  FP
<br />From:  High Commissioner of Commission to Investigate Corruption in the Old Regime (HC-CICOR)
<br />Subject:  Findings Update
<br />
<br />Your excellency, the Commission has discovered a vast underground storage area directly underneath the cellar of the Cubicle of Taw.  Whereas, in the cellar, we found those monkey things and the SPAM and those cane frog items, in the lower chambers, we have discovered some strange crates and racks filled with bottles.  These bottles contain either a dark reddish of relatively clear liquid and they have strange labels and markings on them.  They seem to be writings in Italian and French and perhaps German as well.  Due to the lack of education experienced during the previous regime, we are unable to find persons knowledgable to confirm or correct our speculations.  A search for such talent continues, however.
<br />
<br />At last count we had cataloged some 110,000 bottles.  Shall we dispose of them as we have done with the other items?  The Deputy High Commissioner suggests that we put them up for auction with a reasonably high reserve price of, say $1.00 per bottle.
<br />
<br />&lt;MEMORANDUM&gt;
<br />To: HC-CICOR
<br />From:  FP
<br />Subject:  Disposal of Bottles
<br />
<br />The samples arrived two days ago.  I was unable, however, to complete my personal sampling of them until last night.
<br />
<br />It is a top priority that you not allow any of these bottles to be released to the general public.  There are certain defects in the liquids contained therein to which we dare not allow our beloved citizenry to be exposed.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, in furtherance of our aim to become a responsible member of the community of nations, we dare not allow these bottles to enter into international commerce.  No, I, the First Protector alone, shall bear the burdon of responsibly disposing of these items.  We cannot dispose of these items en masse as there are negative environmental impact issues that need to be avoided at all costs.
<br />
<br />Immediately reseal the vault doors and bring me the keys.  Destroy all duplicate keys.
