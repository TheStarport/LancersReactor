			<div class="content">I didn't mean to start a dustup.
<br />
<br />I appreciate all of the advice. I just used the hex editor to edit the exe file on the following address I found in this line of the Limit Breaking 101 tutorial:
<br />------
<br />1.25f in Freelancer.exe, 0x1C9804 = multiplier for distance at which brackets around non-targeted ships in space will appear (1.25 = ~3km, 37.5 = ~93km, etc)
<br />------
<br />I lowered the decimal number, and poof the brackets were gone.
<br />
<br />I don't need to worry about the hud because I'm letterboxing with a mask in my video editing software so the top and bottom of the screen will be cropped out.
<br />
<br />I'll be sure to announce here when the show is released.
<br />
<br />Thanks again to all. I learned something from each of you. Peace and Happy New Year!

			<div class="content">just to make it clear
<br />i have said not a single word about that flmm would have a problem with activation of the mod
<br />i only stated that some mods dont work with edited inis or dlls because of a anticheat system that they use
<br />if you edit just one single dll or ini those mods wont launch.. the fl.exe wont launch
<br />
<br />ive said not more - not less
<br />unmodded fl and other mods which dont use such a protection system will work
<br />
<br />additionally to this i need to say that all this hex editing has its disadvantages
<br />the hex codes that were posted here to raise the view range and all that (at least 2 of them) cause major graphical bugs for several video cards if suns have to be displayed through nebulas if the ship is has a high distance to that sun
<br />also the well know freelimits where several things were hex edited does cause a major security leak and opens the door for cheaters if should mounts are used for other equipment than just the shields (containers, licences and every other possible type of equipment) -&gt; money cheat
<br />
<br />ive modded and coded long enough to know that hex editing can cause thousands of unexpected side effects... just because you never know what you really edit there
<br />sure you can see the result of the edit but what you edited could also have been a variable which is used for 100 other functions
<br />
<br />guess what... forget about that
<br />forget about that i suggested a &quot;more secure&quot; way of doing things</div>

			<div class="content">well i didn't write that software and i'm not familiar with it - fleef doesn't have an incompatible mod, and is quite satisfied with the results. so why post your 'helpful' 'advice' anyway?
<br />
<br /> if there's someone you should be pestering with this mole hill it's the mod's author/cheat-detection-software writer and not me/anyone who's interested in my mod. and yes, you look like a pompous ass - you don't have to say &quot;I know everything&quot; to ensure you give the impression that you think so.
<br />
<br />*incredulous look* holy crap, FL has security loopholes? when did this happen?

			<div class="content">no you didnt write that software and nobody blamed you for not knowing about that
<br />that fleef didnt use such a mod was said long after all this mess started... after i got insulted for posting a &quot;possible solution&quot; to fleefs problem... insulted for nothing other than having a different oppinion about how things can be done
<br />and now i got insulted again for posting about bugs that appear after using those hex codes and reporting that some mods dont work with the &quot;no hud&quot; mod
<br />
<br />lets see
<br />fleef asked
<br />i answered
<br />then it was said that hex editing is way better
<br />i said i doubt it (coz i had obvious reasons)
<br />i got insulted for that
<br />i explained my reasons 
<br />and now i get insulted again
<br />a nice community where the forum rules get broken that fast just because some1 does speak out of experience and others dont like it... great - really great
<br />
<br />&quot;Refrain from using any language that is a slur or swear word - your posts will be edited or deleted.&quot;
<br />&quot;Do not flame, abuse, or post anything that is insulting towards other members, but instead treat one another with respect.&quot;
<br />
<br />oh btw. no matter if you want to know about those bugs which are result of the hex editing... other might want to know about them and they have the right to see what could happen
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y15/wiseag/screen35.jpg">http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y15/wi ... reen35.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />thats the result using the hex codes that were presented (several sol/nebular combinations do work others dont)
<br />the hex changes on freelimits does cause a problem with shields which can be used even by a starflyer to make billions in just a few hours (usually security leaks should be closed and not opened by mod creators)

<br />So please lets just all try and get along and work together and make this site the best it can be.

<br />Right now I'm having problems sending out email through the lancers reactor email server and were also having problems with getting enough help on the site.
<br />Finalday is posting the news items and hopefully I will be able to find the time to post the mods and utilities.
<br />

<br />You offer no suggestion as to why. Your post had no information value, indeed, it just dismissed what he said in a rather high handed &quot;i know better, but not telling&quot; manner.
<br />
<br /> Like I said, the post didn't give any reasons for your views about it... so what exactly WAS the point of posting it? I still fail to see ANY reason for it. I did (correct me if I am wrong) point out that you aren't offering any material to back up your slight towards that method. Hence, incase you failed to note, i asked what it's based upon. I gave a list, it's not intended to be that insulting - it supposed to highlight the fact that you've posted your opinion without anything to back it up, and in a very recognisably sarcastic way (my list that is, each bigger and worse than before!). I am sure you picked up the sarcasm in that sentence, and that it's also rhetorical. However, if you must insist on the ego part, take a look at your grammar and phrasing of the sentence. Presenting an idea that you know better, but with no indication upon how you reached this conclusion.
<br />
<br />Deal with it in whatever way you see fit, but your claims about helping for 6 years and now suddenly stopping seem a bit on the pram/rattle side. Calm down dear, it's only a forum!
<br />
<br />Gravedigging, well, read the rules again. It clearly states that as long as the post is on topic and contributionary in some way, then it's welcomed. 
<br />
<br />As for &quot;flames&quot;, we don't treat folks like children. Whilst blatant insults (such as &quot;your a fu*$*(% pr(*&amp; and i hope you die!!!1one1!&quot; are not allowed, a lively discussion IS allowed. Folks get angry and mad, but they may express themselves without making threats or insults with banned vocab (that includes negating the filter). We interpret the rules and enforce them, if someone feels unjustly done by - they may contact the moderators, or try the admins instead.
<br />
<br />Beyond that, a bit of maturity and restraint is all that is required -- being able to take a criticism is a large part of that, and dealing with said criticism in a mature manner is another factor.

<br />
<br />so &quot;just make the textures transparent&quot; is no suggestion?
<br />from my point of view it is a very good suggestion and if he would have asked how to do this i would have answered

<br />the point to post it was my oppinion about hex editing... and oppinions as long they dont violate the forum rules are free to be posted and there is no need to explain anything in detail about them

<br />&quot;your egotisical thoughts about how much better you are than others? &quot;
<br />in my eyes this is a personal attack against me very close to an insult

<br />
<br />to judge by grammar or phrasing is the worst thing you can do... im not sure where you are from but very likely you come from us or uk and english is your natural language... you did speak it your entire life while other people dont
<br />by now i speak 5 different languages... im not perfect in them and in the time im leading online communities i have learned to to judge by wrong written words, wrong choosen words which basically have the same meaning, grammar or wrong phrasing

<br />
<br />those &quot;claims&quot; about those 6 years are true but i have not said with a single word something about to stop helping people... not with a single word

<br />the gravedigging was not allowed until i decided to state my &quot;oppinion&quot; on it
<br />there were lots of threads where people have asked something on old threads and the reply was &quot;gravedigging&quot;

<br />
<br />i wish you would follow your own suggestion
<br />but if you call it immature if i defend myself from being called &quot;egoistic&quot; or being instulted... if it is immature to post my oppinion on something then i really dont want to be mature
<br />i dont know what you think who i am... but for sure im not a kiddy that needs to accept being treaten in such a way
<br />and the mature way of dealing with that issue would have been to solve it in private instead of posting something against one member of this community

			<div class="content">Isn't CHIPS a moderator here?  I don't see the point where a forum moderator must make a volatile stance or &quot;stir up the pot&quot; with comments that should be certainly done in private.  
<br />
<br />Not because the original or other user has the right to be addressed in private, but for the simple reason that Moderators/admins need to demonstrate tact and respect for the community as a whole, by leading_by_example.
<br />
<br />As Server Police for the CF mod, I certainly put my foot down when I need too and I am VERY strict with our rules, but having said that, it is also necessary for me to treat people with respect so players stay on our mod.........treating people well and with respect, even if they are wrong, usually maintains a solid loyalty......hence more popularity.</div>

			<div class="content">Sorry to chime in here, but i can see chips point of view on ur post Op-r8r. Yes u did answer why,but u did leave it a couple of posts later after chips and someone else posted. You could've said why in that same post. As you have said,u have a considerable knowledge-so perhaps u could've divulged what you knew there..and then this (for use of a better word) playground scrap wouldn't of even happen.
<br />
<br />You do  have merit in what you say about language,i know this from playing with a german COD UO clan for over a year and i was the only english person in the clan and sometimes when i spoke to them in german the meaning came out wrong.
<br />
<br />For instance your line to BP could've been worded better as a question (when are you on-line BP? for instance) as that doesn't exactly seem a great response from you to the guy.
<br />
<br />and btw,this is the line chips was on about i think,which reads to me that you intend to stop helping anybody here
<br />
<br /><i>one thing i have learned, i wont post suggestions on how to improve things here on LR again and i wont try to help LR to find a better future than &quot;death&quot; when FL is gone </i>

			<div class="content">well i just wanted to apologize to my fellow forum readers, I was not happy to be a part of this topic at all. I've said my piece, and offered an olive branch in the form of code, and there's nothing else i can do besides repeat myself to our most helpful benefactor. I sincerely hope that anyone who thinks they can make a better screenshot mod will go ahead and do it, since screenshots rule and there are never enough <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
