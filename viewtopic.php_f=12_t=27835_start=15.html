			<div class="content">yeah RoN rules..... you guys hear of that new expansion? Thrones And Patriots....youll be able to move your capitol around, and theres now a senate building and if you choose a certain type of government it gives you a unique, general-like hero that gives bonuses not only to your entire civ, but also has a palette of his own special abilities (unique for each government and civ) and all those new civs hehe.... Americans, Indians, among others i cant remember, i think theres 6 or 8 new ones. Oh yeah a TON of new random map types (this is my favorite addition) ...... i cant wait!!. As for RA2.... man had some great times in this game..... I remember in old RA2, before Yuri's Revenge I distinctly remember a friend who was battling me over the DC Uprising map. I harvested nearly all the resources on the map, built a cloning vat and squeezed out conscripts until I had no credits left hehehe..... oh and plus Paradrops. I could carpet my whole island with conscripts lol. Anyway I took over the whole map, and just for good measure i destroyed all civilian building that stood in my way just to show off hehehe.

			<div class="content">Sorry for reviving, this, but I have to write one more memorable Shogun goodness. Playing as Oda, I invaded Takeda provinces one by one, until I killed the daimyo. Then his heir took over. The young daimyo only had one province left, and one army (800 in size, commanded by a 4-star general). Always scouting for talents, I bribed the general and he accepted. To make matters worse for Takeda Katsuyori, I added one full army of my own (960 in size, mixed type) to invade his province. 1700 men against 11 mounted heavy cavalry! 
<br />
<br />The battlefield loaded up, and I got control of the former-Takeda army, and ordered them to march forward against their former daimyo. I thought Takeda would have fled the battlefield and hold himself up in his castle and I would then have to besiege him, as AI daimyos usually do. On the contrary - Takeda and his loyal hatamoto charged downhill and threw themselves into a sea of archers, arquebusiers, and yari ashigaru. All killed to the last man, of course, but not before taking out 110 of the &quot;traitors&quot;! the daimyo fell last, after five excruciating minute of hacking and carving limbs all by himself and routed one of my low-morale ashigaru unit. Then his luck finally gave up and he fell. It was a truly glorious death.
<br />
<br />His death, was not unlike the real Takeda Katsuyori, but happened 10 provinces away near the Takeda-Hojo border (only he fought as an archer there)</div>

			<div class="content">@FF, do you get involved in those mindless slogs on and for Awaji? almost every campaign I play in Shogun ends up in an Awaji bloodbath, it's not so bad if you defend, but if you attack it's a massacre (unless you've been preparing for ages) But if you DON'T take Awaji early on especially if you start out on Kyushu or Southern Honshu, then someone else will take it, and you can't afford to let them do that even though it's p*ss-poor as a province. Strategic location... fortunately I've got it down to a fine art now so it's a good place to let generals get experienced and more honourable in relative safety if I've got Awaji, even though I have had one or two nasty surprises there!

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade><b>Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots Expansion Pack Continues the Epic Battle for World Supremacy </b>
<br />
<br />Microsoft Game Studios and Big Huge Games today announce Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, the expansion pack to the critically acclaimed, best-selling real-time strategy (RTS) game Rise of Nations. Developed by Brian Reynolds and Big Huge Games, Thrones and Patriots adds a multitude of new features to Rise of Nations, introducing six new nations, a wide variety of new single player campaigns, more than 20 new units, new wonders and an innovative new Government feature. With the new Government feature, any nation, old or new, can choose exactly how to be governed, which has far-reaching effects on how units perform in various situations. All-new single player campaigns will allow gamers to control the course of history during historical events that changed the world. Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots is expected to ship in Spring 2004. The original Rise of Nations game is available wherever games are sold and has been reduced to $39.99 (U.S.), just in time for the holidays. 
<br />
<br />Rise of Nations, the latest title from Big Huge Games Inc. founder Brian Reynolds (designer of Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri), combines the epic scope of traditional turn-based strategy (TBS) games with the fast-paced action of RTS games. The game allows players to create new cities, improve their city infrastructure and expand national borders. Players have the option to win through military might using everything from slingshots to cannons to stealth bombers, corner the market on key commodities, and wheel and deal with a wide variety of Nations. Unlike other historical RTS games, Rise of Nations allows gamers to quickly play through eight historical epochs of time from the Ancient Age to the Information age, covering 6,000 years of history. Gamers can play a quick battle on any map as one of 18 nations, or play Conquer the World, the unique blending of TBS and RTS gameplay.

			<div class="content">c&amp;c generals zero hours; first time i played it online...
<br />it was a 1v1 game, he toke the nuke gen and i the stealth gen... i don't remember the name off the map, it was a 8-player map, it have 16 oil-derricks, 4 refineries, 4 art platforms, 4 reinforcement pads and 2 repair bays...
<br />
<br />he toke the upper left corner and i the lower right...
<br />
<br />builded up my army and did the first attack, while making a base in the middle off the map... the army i sended destroyed almost his base, he builded now only overlords (the powerfulliest tanks, co'z i have no tank, my army wasn't good against this), he destroyed my main base almost, leaved th scud storm where it was (hiden by camo netting <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).
<br />
<br />i sended 2 workers to 2 sides off the map and build 2 bases at the same time, while the middle base build devences, and units...
<br />
<br />the upperright base was a devence mostly base (lot's off tunnel networks and stinger sites, the other was more an attack base. and builded rocket buggies for destroying tanks. and builded for 60k units in 1 order (5 arms dealers and 3 barracks where training thus units).
<br />
<br />he attacked my attack base, but his army who where left was to small and couldn't break the devence.
<br />
<br />from their i sended units to the middle off our 2 bases (his only base and my lower base). with a large group i started the attack from below and from my devence base is sended stealth unit (rocket buggies and quad cannons) into battle the other side off his base. i won, and builded over 600 units <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />
<br />also c&amp;c generals zero hours; 2v2, i was demo-gen.
<br />me and my m8 where both demo-gen and our enemy where nuke-gen and inf-gen.
<br />the map (for got also this name) has a wall from the left to the right off the map.
<br />
<br />we had a  15 min no rush and no sw rule in the game. after 15 min we began with the attack and brought our jarmen kell in one off their bases and start blowing up building their. our units did good work, and pushed them back to 1/4 off the total map. this 1/4 was better defended and we needed to use more units on this base. my m8 needed to go and gave his base to me, after a long fight the inf-gen had also to go, and the nuke-gen had also use over his base.
<br />
<br />i stayed attacking his base on the weaker spot i maded and after a total time off 2 hours i destroyed his latest building...

			<div class="content"><b>Freelancer: </b>
<br />1) Playing on my LAN server with my 8-year old brother, we both decided to be pirates, so we bought the Wolfhound from Dublin, and decided to go Bounty Hunter hunting. I knew of a great spot, the Tau-31 Jump Hole in Edinburgh! When we arrived there were two or three Gaian ships, about 25-30 BH's and me and my brother, in our fully loaded Wolfhounds, lol. We took them out with the greatest efficiency and skill I have ever seen, and have never forgot that!
<br />
<br />2) Playing on my LAN server again, but this time exploring. Me and my brother swooped the whole of Sigma-17 searching frantically for the Freeport 7 Debris Field. We couldn't find it, so gave up. We returned to Kurile to repair our ships (hostile with Corsairs in Sigma-17 is not good) and stock up on Nanobots, Shield Batteries, Mines, Torpedoes, Countermeasures (good for Sigma-17), and Missiles. On the way back to the Sigma-19 Jump Gate, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye when I was taking screenies of me and my bro in formation. I saw a piece of debris. I ran frantically to my brothers PC, but he couldn't see it. I then ran frantically back to my own PC, and shifted course to this piece of debris, with my brother following me. When we arrived I was astonished. The phenomenal detail that Digital Anvil must have gone too is astounding, and I think that they deserve a pat on the back for that!
<br />
<br />3) Again on my LAN server, lol, myself and my brother's mate (a n00b to the extreme) were flying around Manhattan, when he said something I didn't quite hear. I agreed, and thought what the hell. My mum then summoned us for our dinner, and we went down. I then after dinner had to feed the dogs, guinea pigs, and cat. When I got back upstairs, I was about 200K from Manhattan, with 10-15 Rogues in formation <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I was completely and utterly astounded!
<br />____________________________________________________________________
<br />
<br /><b>Age of Empires 2: </b>
<br />Playing on the LAN, <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>, again with my brother, on the British Isles map. Me vs. him. Now on every other strategy game I have played with my brother, he has completely and utterly whooped my ass, bearing in mind he is half my age, lol <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>! When we've played Homeworld, Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, etc. I have never ever once beaten him.
<br />
<br />So anyway, we designated our land before we started, and agreed not to rush each other until after 15 minutes. He doesn't give a sh1t about things like that anyway lol, so I set up the game as we started in the Post-Imperial Age, with maxed out resources, etc. No cheats though <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>!
<br />
<br />I chose the northern bit of France and Ireland as my land, and he had the whole of Britain. Little did he know, that I had practiced this map numerous times, so I was ready for him. I think it might be Anglesey or something in between Ireland and Britain, and I also chose that. He laughed and simply said: &quot;why do you want that crappy piece of land!?!&quot;
<br />
<br />We set up our bases, armies, etc., with him blatantly breaking the rushing rules. He'd forgotten about my Anglesey? island base thing, and he also was unaware of the far western side of Norway in the top of the minimap thingy. I claimed both of these! He obliterated my French base, and then turned his attention to my Irish one. As he approached from Britain, his ships (transports, fireships, galleons, etc.) were all destroyed, and he didn't know why!
<br />
<br />I had in fact filled the whole of that &quot;crappy piece of land&quot; with Bombard Towers, so there was about 22 towers all together, on one island <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. I ended up losing, but what the hell, it was fun!

<br /><b>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 </b>
<br />Playing on the Internet a long time ago, well last summer, I downloaded this map off of somebody, and played it with him and two other guys. We were all on broadband, and if somebody joined who was on anything less, we booted them <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> lol. So anyway, us 4 broadband kids on this mega-map. I aligned myself with this guy, and the other two aligned.
<br />
<br />Now this map was phenomenal! It was absolutely massive, and everybody started on a raised section of land, with only one way in or out of the base. Much much later on, as in about 4 hours later, I had set up about 50 or so Prism Towers near the entrance to my base, but had forgot about Patriot Missiles for ground-to-air defence.
<br />
<br />So I decided to start building up my army! This was the fun part! I built up an army of loads of Prism Tanks, and Chrono Legionnaires, but put them in them Mobile things that changed when you put people in.
<br />
<br />So anyway lol, after on numerous occasions using Spies to steal all of my enemies resources (there are advantages to being British!) and taking out anybody that came within a few hundred (cyber) yards of my base, I built up my force.
<br />
<br />I attacked my first enemy with everything I had, losing about 75% of my army, but completely and utterly obliterating him! I called in for reinforcements (so to speak) from my Ally, who sent in Tesla Troopers, Nuclear Lorries, etc. and using his Nuclear Lorries, took out most of the infantry before I got there.
<br />
<br />During this time, my second enemy had assembled a massive force not too far from my base, but too far for either of us to see each other. He had sent in spies a couple of times and got me back, so he could see my base still. So while my ally and I were obliterating our second enemies base, he turned his attention to my base! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> which I was NOT happy about.
<br />
<br />So I pulled back, leaving my Ally to be destroyed. My base was under attack, as the computer had told me numerous times lol, and I tried my best to defend it, but he split his forces into two groups, one of Apocalypse Tanks, and loads of other stuff, to attack my base from a small distance. My Snipers were useless against these, and my Prism Towers were slowly but surely being destroyed.
<br />
<br />As my force that had pulled back was destroyed, I made a load of them Chrono Legionnaires and started phasing out some of the tanks. He wasn't happy, and turned his whole force on my 10-15 Chrono Legionnaires, which were made quick work of.
<br />
<br />During this time, I repaired my Prism Towers, and built about 10 more, so I had maybe 45 - 50 Prism Towers just standing there. Once he'd took out my Chrono forces, he turned his attention to my base once again.
<br />
<br />But this time there was no stopping me! I had my Barracks, about 10 - 15 Power Plants, my Ore Mine thing, an Ore Refinery, and best of all my War Factory. I could only hence build basic units, no mega ones like the Prism or Mirage tanks. His mega force of Apocalypse Tanks and Yuris took no time at all in obliterating or converting my remaining forces.
<br />
<br />As he approached my base, the rhythmic sound of Prism Towers powering up was amazing, and with one shot each, his Apocalypse tanks were taken out one by one. I was amazed!
<br />
<br />My ally, who had in the process of all this had repaired and rearmed, was on his way over, when I told him to STOP! I wanted the glory for this last stand! I took out his forces until he retreated! Oh it was sheer bliss!

			<div class="content">Kirov airships en masse will take out any cr*ppy Allied base, no matter what fonkenhausen superweapons you have or how many SAMS you boast. All it needs is for just enough power plants to go down (i always target them first and accept the losses on the way in) then the Allied base is finished, even if they take down most of the Kirovs. The surviving airships, and it doesnt take many, can fan out and take everything else down in a few minutes and there's diddly-squat the poor Allied player can do abaht it...</div>
