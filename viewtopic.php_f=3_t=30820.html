			<div class="content">To save on multiple threads being created for this subject, it has been decided to have the one thread and sticky it. So please feel free to post your Freelancer 2 ideas here, but remember to keep the posts on-topic. Any topic deviations or spam will be deleted, so don't waste your time posting unless you're going to add something constructive.
<br />
<br />Here is a list of topics previously covered and compiled into a list by our good friend Sir Spectre.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />Uranium 235, Pegleg, Batfink and History Buff had similar threads. I decided to make a list of common ideas presented by most posters to avoid unnecessary repetition. 
<br />
<br />As a service I'll list the things almost everyone can agree on, so no one else will waste the time of those who would actually read through all these posts, like myself. If you do want to recite one of these things, please expand on it, don't just repeat it.
<br />
<br />A: Ideas MOST everyone agrees with: 
<br />A01. More dynamics in market/trade system.
<br />A02. More dynamics in &quot;living universe&quot; (the universe doesn't revolve around you, enemies don't break off engagements to come after you, AI prioritizes)
<br />A03. More, More, More:
<br />__a) commodities 
<br />__b) ships 
<br />__c) weapons 
<br />__d) variable upgrades (ala Privateer 1) 
<br />__e) new systems 
<br />__f) contraband
<br />__g) possibly new factions as well (Church of Man Retros, anyone?)
<br />A04. More and balanced ship CLASSES with varying speeds.
<br />A05. Scrap shield batteries for recharging shield.
<br />A06. Scrap nanobots for repairbot.
<br />A07. Ability to hire other ships: 
<br />__a) wingmen 
<br />__b) cargo
<br />__c) escorts
<br />A08. More types of random missions: 
<br />__a) cargo run 
<br />__b) escort 
<br />__c) defend station 
<br />__d) smuggle a person 
<br />__e) rescues 
<br />__f) espionage 
<br />__g) undercover 
<br />__h) blockade runs 
<br />__i) recon
<br />A09. Automatic turret (whether auto or hire a co-pilot)
<br />A10. Realistic random events to increase need for certain goods. (accidents, famines, etc.)
<br />A11. Mouse control has more axis of movement: 
<br />__a) rolls right-left 
<br />__b) strafe up-down
<br />A12. More ship-to-ship communication with AI:
<br />__a) commands for allies and friendlies
<br />__b) taunts 
<br />__c) threats/requests (Drop cargo or else, etc.)
<br />A13. Capital ships should be stronger with more weapons.
<br />A14. Factional area_assaults against other factions (All out war)
<br />A15. Customize a character. (at least for MP)
<br />A16. Customize a ship. (decals, paintjobs)
<br />A17, Ability to buy varying types of maps, scanners and other ship components.
<br />A18. Own multiple ships. (have a garage or pay storage fees)
<br />A19. Adjustable HUD options.
<br />A20. More 3D universe, not limited to just X &amp; Y plane.
<br />A21. More intelligent AI, especially when dealing with ships of different levels and their general agressiveness.
<br />A22. Expand MP # of users limit and increase functionality.
<br />A23. New or expanded plot and new rumours.
<br />A24. More wrecks &amp; hidden treasures (Perhaps random).
<br />
<br />-------------
<br />
<br />B: Ideas SOME people agree with: 
<br />B01. Buy, build or take over properties: 
<br />__a) stations 
<br />__b) battleships 
<br />__c) planets 
<br />__d) depots
<br />B02. Option to join a faction's navy for a term or two.
<br />B03. Higher pricing for all ships and accessories.
<br />B04. Distress calls to/from friendly faction or Navy.
<br />B05. Join, in all respects, a faction.
<br />B06. Pilotable battle or capital ships.
<br />B07. Casino or other ways to make use of stations and planets.
<br />B08. Larger scale for planets.
<br />B09. Internal voice chat for MP.
<br />B10. Other characters with mini-storylines, not necessarily to do with main plot.
<br />B11. Ability to add your own journal entries to record information learned in game (Rumours).
<br />B12. A commodity price list for all visited places.
<br />B13. Taxation: income taxes, lane tolls, gate usage fees.
<br />B14. Bounty Board (most wanted list)
<br />B15. Cloaking device (fair and balanced, for MP &amp; SP)
<br />B16. Races or competitions for prizes.
<br />B17. Measurable passage of time &amp; timed missions.
<br />B18. Adjustable energy allocation (shields, engines, guns)
<br />B19. Less eye candy (Space effects, not Juni)
<br />B20. Faster and more types of missiles and countermeasures.
<br />B21. Player ejection with multiple outcomes (slave, hospital, arrested)
<br />B22. Fuel for flight (Either just for turbo or both turbo and regular flight)
<br />B23. Joystick Flight
<br />B24. Add back in Sol system and previous Starlancer elements.
<br />B25. Include elements used in Elite (planet orbits, better level system, etc.)
<br />
<br />-----------
<br />
<br />I think that's about it. If you see it in this list please don't post it again unless you elaborate. I don't have EVERYTHING, only the things that get repeated the most.
<br />     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />If you have anything to add to the list, go your hardest. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Alright, I have some thoughts that you have not yet mentioned. Not sure which section they belong to, though <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />- more realistic solar systems with planets orbitting around sun.
<br />- more places to visit on space stations and spaceports
<br />- completely customizable player character (gender, looks, even clothing with special clothing that might only become available through certain faction missions - this should be interesting for mp)
<br />- faction ranks/titles that can be attained
<br />- some of the old factions from Starlancer
<br />- more customizable ships - paint jobs, modular construction that allows different combinations
<br />- individual npc pilots (apart from the generic ones) that have their own agendas, whether they be notorious pirates, famed bounty-hunters or shrewd traders
<br />- larger navy fleets patrolling space or guarding certain strategic points
<br />- intelligent economic system that actually reacts to changes in supply/demand (new trade routes open up/old ones are abandoned)
<br />- npc ships that are actually travelling from one system to the other instead of just disappearing.</div>

			<div class="content">-No Nomad weapons. Put an end to the cheap crap uber-guns.
<br />
<br />-J******* support. You know what I mean. No need to mention that further.
<br />
<br />-NPC loot/escape pod tractoring...when a freighter gets whacked, it would be nice to see the escorts try to salvage the cargo and save the crew. 
<br />
<br />-A nav map that can be set into the HUD rather than appearing dead center over the reticle. 
<br />
<br />-Smoother sensor system(i.e. don't have to scroll through 6 dozen contacts to find the right one).
<br />
<br />-More emphasis on shield/weapon type interactions. As is, the advantages of one shield type are offset by the higher rating of another, so the higher rating is almost always better regardless of weapon type. Likewise, the strongest weapon, no matter what it is strongest against, is the prime choice. End this. Make all shields of the same class have the same rating, and cut the damage of the countered weapon types so much as to make using them problematic(and make the weaknesses much, much bigger).
<br />
<br />-Each time you piss off a faction, it takes a liiitle bit more to get back on their good side. Killing X number of that faction's enemies should not do the job if you have killed them as well, and bribes should get bigger each time they are needed (you kill 50 outcasts and $50,000 is enough to get you god with them again? Puh-leaze, let's see that number bumped up to $1000000 or more).
<br />
<br />-Multiple bases on each planet, where applicable(capitol planets, major bases, etc.) have 2-3 docking rings if necessary. 
<br />
<br />And while I'm at it, I'd like to win the lottery, a free car, my own strip club, and a trip to the ISS...  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Hello! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Ideias taken from previous games (Elite, Privateer):
<br />
<br />We shouldn't get the same ship back when it is destroyed. The player should have to buy another ship (or rent one?). If he didn't have the money... bad luck! That way, players would be much more careful.
<br />
<br />With some effort, in Freelancer we can be neutral with all factions. That shouldn't be possible. The game get's boring and easy.
<br /> 
<br />All factions should be more balanced - with both weak AND strong ships. Joining a faction would be more interesting that way.
<br /> 
<br />The ships could have different shield areas (like in Privateer). In combat, we could use that as another tactical factor.
<br /> 
<br />Players should be able to choose their starting faction.
<br /> 
<br />And that's all I can remember (for now). <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">For everybody's sake, I will repost what a possible storyline could be.  I think it is better than some of the other out there (of course, that's because I made it, so I am a bit biased).
<br />
<br />&quot;It has been three years since the events of Freelancer. The nation of Hispania has been founded, with the system formerly known as Omicron Alpha now know as New Madrid, and the Planet Malta now Planet New Madrid. Cryer Pharmaceuticals has found a way to reverse the genetic changes caused by Cardamine, thus relieving the former Outcasts of their addiction. A new system, Florida, has been added on to Liberty, and two new areas, Delta and Alpha, have been found. The storyline starts as two cargo ships are heading for Planet Harris in Tau-31 (Planet Harris plays a major role in my storyline). One freighter is carrying Toxic Waste and MOX for trade, while the other is carrying Oxygen, Terraforming Gases, Water, and Alien Organisms for Planet Harris. The first freighter, carrying the Toxic supplies, drops out of the trade lane normally, but a malfunction occurs. The second transport continues at trade lane speeds and hits Planet Harris. The environment changes rapidly; oxygen, terraforming gases, and water make the atmosphere breathable, and the Alien Organisms rapidly mutate to better survive in their rapidly changing environment. Soon, the planet has sparse vegetation, and it is ready to be colonized. However, the Terraforming Station, the orbiting Planetform, Inc., station was destroyed, as were as several ships in orbit. Several thousand people are dead&#8230; and it is up to Edison Trent to find out what went wrong. What he finds plunges him, Jun&#8217;ko Zane, and all of Sirius into chaos.&quot;
<br />
<br />The story will mostly revolve around two systems:  Harris System (formerly Tau-31) and Delta-45.  I am sorry to say, I really don't like the idea of putting the Nomads, Dom Kovash (or however it is spelled), the Coalition (same), or anything else like that.  Also, I vote that the format be kept EXACTLY the same.  I think a more reasonable storyline should be developed.  Thanks for reading my endless babble.

			<div class="content">One thing that people loved about freelancer was its simplicity. I'm a big fan of big stories so if MS did allow a second freelancer game to be made, this is what really needs to be developed. Whilst the majority of people have internet access, not everyone can afford a broadband connection to enable faster MP gaming. Unreal had a SP release and then the spin off Unreal Tournement was made. If the game was financialy benifical to MS then this could perhaps be an option for them. I pretty certain everyone here would have played SP through a few times before jumping in to MP.
<br />
<br />I agree with the combined Outcasts/Corsairs bit. Most sequels start were the prequel left off (usually shortly after). So developing the story from what happend at the end of Freelancer 1 needs to be continued. We all know what happens at the end so think of how the story ends before Manhatten. 
<br />
<br />Digital Anvil had a superb storyline in this game (which is why i have played this game more times than i can remember) but seemed rushed through. Don't get me wrong, this is the story in any game i have played through, but just as you were starting to get used to Trents &quot;Hey Watcha Got's etc it was all over. I think complex and deep storyline - But not confusing like matrix!</div>

			<div class="content">I would like to see the same type of multiplayer (for slow connections) in FL2, and an option for MMORPG style play (maybe subscription, or fast connection).  The reason why both is that I don't want to see people complaining &quot;Why is there only MMO play and not SSO (small scale online) play?&quot; <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />One definite thing, more ships, maybe a create your ship option if the MMO option is available.  Official modding tools!  That brings up another reason to have SSO play, so you can activate mods for online play.  More players for SSO play.  More factions, no Nomad weapons in Multiplayer (as an option), and a better reputation system.  For bribes, maybe you should be able to pay double for a *secret* rep build so you don't lose any rep with any other faction.  Maybe hire wingmen, have the ability to rent/buy a Battleship.  Moving dockable bases too.  
<br />
<br />Sorry if this is a little sloppy, but I have very little time on my hands.

			<div class="content">Just as a note to what was copied in the original post, some of these things have been made possible by skillful modders.  For instance the axis of movement for the mouse was added to Starfyre Studio's Next Generation Mod if I recall correctly.  With Accushot's program that is in production, it may be possible to own stations and factions as well as having a dynamic commodity system.  I'm amazed at what has been accomplished in the 9 months since I wrote that list above.

			<div class="content">...One word: Scale. It would be a lot more bad ass if the planets didn't seem as big as, maybe, the city I live in in perspective to the ships and stuff. Seriously, they looked ridiculous when I first saw the game! What happened to the massive planets like in Starlancer? sure, it's an open universe so you have to be able to cram a whole nebula of systems into a single disk, or do you have to? Use multiple disks! but anyway, if the ships' speeds and planet size and distances were a little more acurate, like you'd have to do the old jump thing to get to certain coordinates, there'd be alot more realism and openness to the game, not to mention the potential for mind-blowing detail. A million-mile diameter gas planet to your left, full view, maybe little clouds swirling ever-so-slowly, I dunno, something. Suns would be freggin huge, you wouldn't be able to ride to other planets in minutes at only 300 m/s, you'd be freggin blazin past light speed to get there in a few minutes, warp there in a few seconds!

			<div class="content">Battlecruiser Millenium had more realistic scaling...even that wasn't completely perfect scaling, but believe me, it takes forever to get anywhere without jumping in that game. Few people playing FL have the kind of patience it would take to wait on such massive distances. FL is not a hardcore sim, but more of a sim-lite that somewhat blurs the line between arcade shooter and simulator- if you pressed larger distances and proper scaling, you would lose some of the audience.
<br />
<br />That would be good, however, for a mod- I have no doubt that the capable modders for FL could increase the size of the planets, moons, stars, and everything else.

			<div class="content">Well hello,
<br />
<br />First things...I don't know quite know how this may come out, so if I sound harsh I really don't mean it.
<br />
<br />Okay, we are lucky that we have any Freelancer at all since it was delayed for at least 3 years. Which is why the graphics arn't super. But oh well!
<br />
<br />Secondly, alot of this stuff involves messing with the code, which I may point out is not only highly illegal but also very difficult. For instant, someone mentioned adding to the game the ability to hire wingmen (or women!). Well, thats not going to happen.
<br />
<br />Thirdly, if you really want to get this stuff implimented you need to do one of two things. First you could send email after email (or get a group of people to do it) to Microsoft and beg/plead for another Freelancer game. Which, at the point in time is quite unlikely. Why is this you ask? Well, it has to do with how much money Microsoft made off of Freelancer 1. You wonder why they only released one (1) patch? Well, its because it wasn't a super success. I don't know if they made profit off of it...if any.
<br />
<br />So, since it seems that Microsoft is unlikely to help, there is one thing left. This is to make your own game...good luck.
<br />
<br />I am not quite sure who you are writing this too, because I highly doubt that Microsoft will check fan sites like this (Before you scream and shout, this is a fan site).
<br />
<br />Please remeber this is just my own opinion, you can disagree; just be sure to back it up with some logical argument...and don't insult; thats being stupid.
<br />
<br />Saber out.</div>

			<div class="content">@Saber, welcome to Lancer's Reactor.  I wanted to say that as I have never seen you post before, though you have been here since December of last year.  That being said, please know that this whole discussion is a concinement of &quot;wishlists&quot; put into one thread, because too many people were remaking the same topic in too many new threads.
<br />
<br />This isn't about what should we do to the game now, such as hire wingmen, we know we can't.  This is about what we would like to see for Freelancer 2, as said in Mustang's opening post.  That does mean they are thoughts on what the future may bring, not necessarily what we can do in the present.  Although some of these ideas have come to fruition in some mods made by talented people.
<br />
<br />Again, welcome. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Sir S

			<div class="content">hello to forum
<br />
<br />I used the site to download mods, unfortunately i dont have the skills to condribute with a mod but to share ideas is the least i can do <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />What the game realy needs isnt a new story , new ships, weapons or anything; it just needs more interaction between the factions.Each of them have plans (the GC want to overthrow kusari government, corsairs to take over rheinland etc) and targets (outcasts want to expand via dope trading) , i say let them have it.
<br />
<br />I would love to start as member of a faction and try to fullfill its potential, helping farmers alliance to kick synth foods out of their space and so. New bases to be constructed /destroyed , shipyards and factories to expand , bounty hunters to finaly run out of ships and get eliminated , zoners to fight against houses to keep them out of their systems and so on.
<br />
<br />This will make interesting both strategical fighting and trading (suply planetform facility all equipment they need to terraform a planet and set up a base).Changing alliences would be great as well and please keep the nomads out of this .Adding 5-10 totaly empty systems will be great since factions will have to fight to get em
<br />
<br />This is my understanding of &quot;endless game&quot;
<br />
<br />p.s. I dont agree with the concept of owning a base , if you have ever play x-beyond the frontier you can understand that new problems in gameplay will arrive</div>
