<br />
<br /> I am starting to have chills in anticipation for this game. This is already said to be one of the most anticipated games of all time, right up there with Doom 3, Half-Life 2, Halo 2, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. And as of writing this, in 47 days Ubisoft will release it's ultimate masterpiece, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. And needless to say, I can hardly wait. From what I have seen so far, this game not only looks unbelievable ( Hey I saw screen shots for the PS2, and it looks awesome, don't even get me started with how good the PC looks) but will apparently play even better than it looks.
<br />
<br />  Back by popular demand, the Shadownet vs. Mercs multi player option is back, with new moves, co-op moves and new gadgets. Also it will have multi player co-op via On-line, System-link or even split-screen! That was one of the only things missing in the multi player from SP Pandora Tomorrow, so for someone who just can't seem to get their PS2 on-line, the split-screen option is a very good idea. Did I mention that this game looks unbelievable? With the spy co-op, and the new set of co-op moves, the spys will be able to access areas that were previously unaccessible. And when I saw this at E3, it just made my heart pound. It was the multi player, with two spy players and an NPC guard (yes, apparently you don't have to have people on a separate team to do the multi player, everyone can be on one team if they want and have the AI control the other team) The spys (who were the human players) had to hack a computer, but there was a guard standing right in front of it with his back turned, so what did they do? They went up into the ventilation ducts, opened a hatch and one of the spys lowered the other down to the computer. There the Spy hacked the computer hanging upside down about three feet from a guard! Then as seamlessly as the spy got down there, he was pulled back up and went on to the next objective. I can't tell you much about the single player yet, as not much has been reveled.
<br />
<br />Sorry for the long post, but I'm really getting caught up in the moment.
<br />
<br />This is a direct quote from a lot of you.
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade> I hate Splinter Cell, there's just too much damn sneaking around. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />For all of you who think Splinter Cell is all about stealth and good graphics, then your partially right. In SC and SC PT, the only focus was on stealth and staying discreet (sp?). But in Chaos Theory, you can basically turn it into MGS if you want. You want to go in the stage and kill everybody you see? Then fine, but it will cost you some points at the post mission stats. Or if you can make it through the level without being seen once, then you will get the perfect 100% score. So that probably says that gamers will be seeing the dreaded &quot;Mission Failed&quot; screen a lot less. The only way to fail a mission is to die or screw up one of your primary objectives.
<br />
<br />You manage to grab a guard from behind, so what are you going to do? Knock him out? Shoot him? Interrogate him? Or even slit his throat with the knife? The choice is yours.
<br />
<br />For all of you who played the first Splinter Cell and Pandora Tomorrow, you know that if you get spotted by an enemy and an alarm is sounded, when the security stage goes back to normal, then the guards act like you never existed. In Chaos Theory, that will not be the case. Even when the security stage goes back to normal, the guards will still act very nervous. If you are still thinking this is the same as SC or SC Pt, then you are probably thinking that you can take out a guard, maybe a couple of inconvenient light sources and go back to your little hiding place. Wrong! So very very wrong! The AI in SC CT will check every nook and every cranny. This AI is award winning, said to be top of the line, ever. If they find out that your are shooting at them, they will find cover, if there is more than one of them, they will flank your position and surround you. And unlike SC or SC PT, after a short time, they will notice that half of their men have gone missing, and step up the security a bit.
<br />
<br />So all in all, this game is going to be unbelievable, (not to mention, in this game the water will actually look like water, not some mysterious mercury fluid, and there will be so many different ways to get through a level). I can hardly wait for this game to come out. And I'm sorry for such a long post about this game, but I am trying to help enlighten all of those Splinter Cell haters, maybe this game will make you think twice about judging a game just because its slightly linear and stealthy (OK I admit it, the first Splinter Cell was the most linear game I have ever played, and I still loved it.) So for all of you people who want to turn SC into metal gear solid, then be my guest. Of course, killing everyone you see will kind of lower your stealth rating, but hey, not as much sneaking around is involved. But I have to end this post so I don't get flamed by the mods about making an unreasonably long post.</div>

			<div class="content">Sorry guys, but apparenly I misscounted. At the end of the day it will be 46 days untill the release. Yesterday was the 48th day, I forgot to count yesterday and started with today. But as of writing this it is about 10:00 AM here in Atlanta.
<br />
<br />And as far as what system to play it on, as I'm sure many of you know my computer completly sucks, and I was hoping to get an Xbox with Live servace for christmas, but I insted got a very crappy computer and a Nintendo DS. Yes, I agree that the online for the PS2 could use a little bit of work, take for example when I was playing SC: Pandora Tomorrow online I was on the Shadownet team (those are the spys for those of you who don't know) and the Nightvision was so ......... blea. It was like I was looking threw mud, so Nightvision was preddy useless for me. 
<br />
<br />But the only system I can play on is the PS2, because my computer sucks and I don't have an Xbox or Gaycu.......I mean Gamecube. Not to mention the Gamecube version of Pandora Tomorrow doesn't even have online play.</div>
