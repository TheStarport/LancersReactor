			<div class="content">I felt the Matrix: Reloaded was a sensible, delightful little film involving sophisticated philosophy and long go-nowhere fight scenes. I hate to say it, but they some how managed to make fight scenes boring (something I didn't think was physically possible until I watched this movie--they were too long with no pay off, unless you consider Neo running away like a scared little boy in every scene climactic). So without further ado, heres 4 things that could have improved The Matrix: Reloaded.
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><b>1. Replacing Keanu Reeves with a wooden plank with a mean face on it.    </b>
<br />
<br />The subtle point here is the mean face: without it, Reeves would be on par with a wooden plank, except a bit more rigid. He approaches every scene with the steadfast determination of a moron running into a wall. I have a theory as to why Keanu's acting is so crappy: a long time ago when he &quot;made it big&quot; with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, a lot of people were probably trying to kiss his ass because he became a huge celebrity and people are shallow, so they have to fill their boring lives with trivial bullsh*t like clinging onto celebrities. Since then, he has surrounded himself by suck-ups, and everyone's too afraid to tell him that his acting sucks. It's never going to change, because Keanu (what kind of name is that anyway? Sounds like a foreign car company) keeps surrounding himself by suck-ups, so he'll keep making crappy movies forever. At least if they replaced him with a wooden plank, the plank would have an excuse to have the same stupid look on its face all the time. 
<br />
<br /><b>2. A Girl   </b>
<br />
<br />I wouldn't have minded this movie so much if I would have remembered to bring my girlfriend to the theater. At least then I could have gotten some action instead of being patronized by stupid bullsh*t about &quot;causality.&quot; Good job you shrubs, you've managed to surface the underlying philosophy of just about every other movie in existence.
<br />
<br /><b>3. A laptop with Freelancer   </b>
<br />
<br />If i had brought my laptop with freelancer, i wouldnt have felt that i had 2 hours of my life stolen from me by some pointless garbage. Guess what everyone, machines need us to work! WOW!! The most logical assumption became a thirty minute discussion between keanu and an old cabbage.
<br />
<br /><b>4. A time machine so you can go back in time and warn yourself not to see The Matrix: Reloaded.   </b>
<br />
<br />Enough said.
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Even if you disagree with everything bad I've said about this movie, there's one point I think everyone can agree on: Keanu Reeves' ass does not need to be seen, ever. Not only do they show you his pasty white ass, they do it in the most contemptible way possible: right after a titty scene. They try to trick you into some sensible porn, then WHAM. Keanu's corn hole. There's an acceptable degree to how many times his ass can be shown in a movie, and that degree is either 0, or negative (negative means that Keanu Reeves' ass gets cut off, which would rule). On a side note, in case you get in an argument with a Matrix nerd cult member, the &quot;Keanu's ass&quot; argument always wins. It's like playing rock, paper, scissors and sucker punch to the throat. The sucker punch always wins. Don't believe me? Try it: next time a Matrix nerd starts rambling on about &quot;Christological symbolism&quot; and other geeky sh*t that nobody cares about, just say the magic words. I guarantee you'll either win the argument, or give the impression that you're an acute homophobe. Either way you win.. sort of. 
<br />
<br />Oh and if u feel the need to flame this, dont.

			<div class="content">I think Keanu's awful acting is part of what makes the Matrix so great. Go back and watch the first movie, when he is shown the construct by Morpheus:
<br />Morpheus: You'll notice you're wearing different clothes
<br />*Keanu touches clothes
<br />Morpheus: You have your hair back
<br />*Keanu runs his hand through his hair, right on cue
<br />Morpheus: And no plugs
<br />*Keanu pulls back both his sleeves and checks both arms, again right on cue with his mouth hanging half open like he hasn't figured out how to breath through his nostrils. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />BTW your plank image is broke

			<div class="content">I think Keanu is sweet in the matrix.  His constant cluelessness makes him much funnier than your average action hero - although those superman bits were pushing the smugness barrier.  Come on, the man was in bill and ted, give him a break <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I do agree to the pointlessness of the fight scenes tho.  It didnt bug me much the first time, but the more i thought about it the more it pissed me off.  Dont get me wrong, the fight scenes were brilliant, but why did he bother fighting them at all?  Presumably he wasnt blowing them apart Matrix 1 style 'cause he saw what happened to smith.  So why did he fight the 100 smiths in that scene?  No matter how hard he smacked them with that lamppost or how far he threw them they just got straight back up.  He must have known he couldnt hurt them, and he knew he couldnt kill them, so what was the point?  He could have just 'superman'ed at the start and got away without breaking a sweat.  Now every time is see the fights i am just thinking 'o.k. sweet but what is the point?'
<br />
<br />I think they should have put more effort into sorting that out and less into wasting the first hour of the film showing us a variety of sweaty naked/half naked bodies.  I have heard there is a version of reloaded kicking round the net somewhere with the first hour edited down to 20minutes to remove all the crap - anyone seen it?</div>

<br />Personally I didn't mind reloaded, provided you try not to think about it to much it's not to bad. The whole zion rave was pointless and the fight scenes were a bit drawn out but apart from that I didn't mind it.
