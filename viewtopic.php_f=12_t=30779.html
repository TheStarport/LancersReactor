<br />
<br />     Q is gone, It seems the crew was unaware of him even being here. There was no log entry of a intruder alert, nor of my giving the order of battle stations. It is as if it never occurred. We are still on course for the planetoid, Alpha 357. We should be arriving in one hour. The science department is in full swing. All sensors are activated and data being acquired. 
<br />
<br />The days go by in a blur. As it turns out, there is life on the planetoid, therefore, we can not beam down. The search continues in the asteroid belt.
<br />
<br />Personal Log Stardate 0405.05.1500
<br />
<br />      The last week has been, unusual. The mission aspect was normal, but the personal aspect, well, lets just say, it was different. It started easy enough. Lt. Neo_Kuja wanted the internal security team to work on an exercise program. As an outside variable, he asked Lt. Taw to join and give a Klingon perspective. The program on the holo Deck was set and all entered. It looked like the inside of the Lancers Reactor. They had stepped into the hanger deck area. &#8220;Computer, begin simulation&#8221; Neo ordered. The alarm claxon sounded and the red alert bar flashed. &#8220;Intruder alert in main shuttle bay&#8221; the computer voice announced. All personnel dove for cover, except Lt. Taw. She preceded to draw a Klingon weapon and moved stealthy to the right side to the control panels.
<br />
<br />     The computer used holograms of regelian pirates for this simulation. They were agile and moved toward one of the shuttle pods. &#8220;Halt, stay where you are&#8221; can the order from Neo. Their response was to turn and fire at anyone that moved. The movement was swift, that no one knew who it was, but a arm went sailing on the deck and a cry of pain from one of the pirates. Another security officer managed to stun one of the men. &#8220;You PataH&#8221; can a growl as the third pirate went down, in death, Taw holding her weapon high. 
<br />
<br />     Unknown to the security team, the first officer decided to visit the deck to observe the training. He did not know that Taw was there and not a hologram. He saw Taw with the weapon raised and tackled her to the deck. After a brief struggle, he maneuvered her to beneath him an raised a hand to strike when she said, &#8220;I hope you are beginning a mating ritual, or I may have to kill you, Sir.&#8221;. &#8220;What?&#8221; Esq replied as the team approached. He released her and stood up. Lt. Neo_Kuja asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on Sir?&#8221; then continuing, &#8220;We were in a training simulation, not a real fight&#8221;. Commander Esq turned to Taw and said, &#8220;Be more careful next time, or be dead&#8221; he added a growl and turned away. Taw merely laughed heartily. We left to go to a debriefing while Lt. Neo caught up with the Commander. &#8220;Sir, if you don&#8217;t mind my asking&#8221; Neo started. &#8220; What was that all about and Why did you say what you did&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />     &#8220;Lt., She is a Klingon, a warrior even though a starfleet security officer. They consider an apology a cowards way rather than taking responsibility for your actions&#8221; and then added, &#8220;I would have insulted her if I had apologized to her. Instead, honor is satisfied.&#8221; &#8220;Sir, what about what she said about a mating ritual&#8221; Neo added. The Commanders face turned a little red. &#8220;That is another story for another day&#8221; and headed for the turbolift. As the door opened, Taw was inside. He stepped in and the door slid shut. &#8220;Sir, I request...permission to speak freely&#8221; Taw asked. he touched the (hold) button. &#8220;Granted&#8221; He replied to her. &#8220;Sir, you realize the position you were in, do you not&#8221; She asked. &#8220;Yes I do&#8221; The Cmd. replied. &#8220;Do you wish to pursue a ritual then?&#8221; She asked, looking him in the eye. The only safe reply was the one he spoke, &#8220;Not at this time&#8221;. Which left things open, for now. 
<br />
<br />     Number one related a bit of all that happened, and though I raised the topic of the non-interaction, I did explain the need for caution in this area, but, he could proceed. His face turned a distinctive shade of red. As he left my ready room. He quickly went to holodeck 2 and asked the computer to create a teaching area and to download information on Klingon rituals.  The images caused him to flinch. Then he flinched again, a hand was on his shoulder. Spinning around, he was face to face with Lt. Taw. Dressed in a warriors uniform rather than starfleet issue, she looked ready for battle, but that was what worried Esq, the type of battle he might be in for. They both watched the images unfold, two holograms in what looked like a fight, but wasn&#8217;t. Esq realized that Taw was looking at him, watching his expressions as he watched the holograms, to gage his response.  
<br />
<br />      Klingons did not dissuade the Commander, but, there was something about Lt. Taw. Something that drew him to her. He suddenly felt the desire to bit Taw on the neck. He fought the urge, but was then tackled to the ground with Taw at his neck. He bared his teeth in the Klingon tradition and bit her first. She moved to a kneeling position, appraising Esq. She knew the relationship would go farther in time. 
<br />
<br />     Down in Hydroponics, the sprouting of the flowers was under way. Many of the crew missed the vestiges of spring. This helped them to feel a little more at home.  The rose cutting was removed from the cryogenic storage and was transplanted too. Everyone had a favorite planted. It would take a while, but it would rival any others ships arboretum. 
<br />
<br />      In the observation lounge, I sat looking a report on the Padd that Chief Chips had dropped off. It gave a good review of the abilities of the Chief and he even listed several options of improving performance of the engines. Everyone was giving it their all. All departments are staffed now and getting up to speed. We will be leaving this system soon to begin exploring the area around it.  My only question, is in the sensor logs. When the Q issue came up, the sensors picked up movement near an asteroid. That had nothing to do with Q. So the question is, what do I make of it. 
<br />
<br />     Lt. Sanic was busy in ten_forward trying to get teams together for pareese squares. He had three but needed four for a tournament. The games were transmitted to all rec stations and the crew could watch fro their quarters if they wanted. The sport was beginning to pick up with this crew, but I will leave it for the younger. Sanic also had the schedules for the down hill skiing to be done in the larger of the holodecks. About that time, young Mr. Wolfy came walking. Lt. Sanic looked up. &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Just looking for my friend, Eh_Steve, he hasn&#8217;t been here has he?&#8221; wolfy asked. Wolfy and Eh_Steve were the first two civilians to be brought out of sleep. &#8220;No he hasn&#8217;t, but you do know the computer can help you find him easier than hunting&#8221;Sanic stated as he walked over o the com panel. He touched it as he spoke, &#8220;Computer, please give me the location of Mr. Eh_Steve.&#8221; The computer responded, &#8220;Mr. Eh_Steve is in holodeck 3&quot;. 
<br />
<br />     I called my security chief and Commander Esq into my ready room. Commander Fear Factor was the first to arrive. I motioned him to have a seat. He is our only Ba&#8217;ku crew member and one of only two in starfleet. Esq came in and I got the meeting underway. I showed on th view screen, the recordings of the sensor logs and the visuals we recorded. My tasks I assigned them, was to find out what or who this is and a threat assessment. I needed all the answers I could get if something could be a threat to the ship. Fear Factor said he would have Lt. Neo_Kuja work a schedule of security officers to run random patrols for a while for safety sake. 
<br />
<br />
<br />     Lt. Taw was down in stores checking through some of the supplies she had packed before they left spacedock. The foodstuffs, real blood wine for special occasions, and the embryos to start the Gagh worms to growing. These she set aside to take to the science lab. She was ready for the morning workout in the holodeck. This program, would truly test her mettle and all her reserves. She relished it that she stepped up her pace to get there and begin.
