			<div class="content">Here are the features for the last three versions:
<br />v09c:
<br />-bretonia ships reverted to original, both for police and navy
<br />-npc shields now regenerate faster and will drop as loot!
<br />-moved the Kusari gunboat to Planet Kyushu due to difficulty to undocking to BS Nagumo(don't try to land there or on any Kusari BS with a gunboat!)
<br />-the mod comes with 3 levels of dificulty, just run level1.bat for lvl1 difficulty, level2.bat for second level and level3.bat for third level.
<br />-first level(easy): colision damage 2, cruise speed 400, npc shield regen 1/2 from player, npc armor weaker, npc loadout less dangerous, cruise disrupt time:4, more hp to player and atached weaps. be warned that in this level npc shields or any other equip will NOT drop as loot.
<br />-second level(default): colision damage 3, cruise speed 450, npc shield good regen, without armor powerups, cruise disrupt time:5, more shield damage(0.6 instead of 0.5 of hull damage), normal hp to players ship and atached weaps. New npc loot drop will be limited to shield generators.
<br />-third level(hard): colision damage 4, cruise speed 500, npc shield full regen and with armor powerups, cruise disrupt time:6, more shield damage(0.7 instead of 0.5 of hull damage), less hp to players ship and atached weaps. This level is the most rewarding with full npc loot drop like thrusters, mines, missiles, and shield gens.
<br /> the npcs are using more varied loadouts they're never used before. 
<br />-i recommend u keep default level though, at least for the begining, especially in MP for compatibility reasons, also in storyline missions don't activate the hard level or NPC's will kick your @ss and the ones of your friends. hard level is recomended for hardcore players, the ones seeking a better challenge, and much better rewards as well.
<br />-activated the 2 hidden hardpoints on the dagger, the underwing ones. weapon loadout for storyline line hackers, outcasts and blood dragons dagger fighters has been updated(Lord Hakkera and Dexter Hovis as well).
<br />-gunboats can now strafe as any other ships.
<br />-increased gunboat cargo holds by 400 due to the fact that u'll lose 400 cargo units after first save/reload.
<br />
<br />I want to say that I own many thanks and credits to the guys that posted here and emailed me their ideas, observations and thieir work: 
<br />Sam Wojtczak , Chris Scott, Brett S., Integer Man, Griskard, Grssk, Radiation, DjVgalen, GUX, Phroot, Steel, freighter fighter, 
<br />col. Chris and many others. their posts, bug reports, ideas and even code was very helpful in bringing the mod to what is now. 
<br />A word of thanks and gratitude is owned for the admins as well, thanx Christian and Nels for your support and great work here on the site...
<br />without you nothing of my and others work would have been possible. 
<br />
<br />v09d:
<br />-fixed gunboat  IDS? name problem
<br />-greatly increased BS and Cruiser damage and range of turrets for lvl 2 and 3. BS engage now at 5 km away, and cruisers at 4 km! varied their cargo as well, fixed their loadout to include more varied types of turrets.
<br />-fixed the Object Unknown display for Pirate Capital Ships, they all have now correct designations coresponding to their class and house of origin.
<br />-added more encounters in the Omicron systems, now the GMG guild joins the fray flying Kusari capital ships. Frequent battles between 2, 3 or more fleets are taking place near Malta, Crete, Freeport 5 and Freeport 9!
<br />-added buyable Battleship Flak Turrets to planet Malta and planet Crete, they're intended for use with the gunboats since they're too big for fighters.
<br />-increased gunboat shield battery/nanobot loadout(doubled them). 
<br />-added suport for Jedi Starfighter from Porsche and White Star Cruiser(babylon 5). please DL both ships from LR  and copy their respective directories to FL\data\ships.
<br />-White Star Cruiser is buyable at planets Los Angeles and New Tokyo and the Jedi Starfighter at planet Junyo, Shi***u, and BS Yukon, California.
<br />-increased transport turret damage for GMG and IMG guilds, also increased further turret damage for stations, trade lanes and docking rings.
<br />-fixed the corvettes engine display, pls download latest Porsche's version from LR and overwrite the first one.
<br />-re-added junkers CSV at planet Pittsburg with 4/1 gun/turret this time(guess I missed the old scrappy guy).
<br />-added stealthblades mkI as standard weapons for the TIE's and for the new Jedi Starfighter.
<br />-included MP Neutrality MOd v1.1 from Integer Man, for better MP starting choices.
<br />-&quot;kill batleship&quot; random missions appear in the Omicron sytems, at planet Malta, Crete and Leon base
<br />
<br />v1.0b:
<br />-&quot;kill batleship&quot; random missions now appear all the way from Bretonia to Edge Worlds.
<br />-modified factions so u'll get to kill the appropriate BS for each faction, Bretonia BS for Corsairs, Kusari BS for GMG and Blood Dragons, Rheinland Bs's for Red Hessians and Liberty Bs's for Outcasts.
<br />-all other factions have mixed BS killing missions.
<br />-added LDP4 Armored Marine Dropship from Hostile universe V.4, with 4/3 guns/turrets and a torp launcher. It's buyable at Planet New London and BS Nagumo. Gunboat Large Fwd Guns are mountable on the top torpedo launcher as well.
<br />-added Sunslayer Torpedo Launcher to planet Malta and Planet Crete, God knows u'll need it.
<br />-fixed Junker and Xenos Object Unknown error when flying Gunboats, also fixed same error for Blood Dragons  flying Kusari BS's and destroyers.
<br />-activated the hidden Hp's on Dromedary, it has now 8 turret and 3 guns.
<br />-Hammerhead now has 9 guns due to the fact that the turret can only fire backwards.
<br />-the mod comes now with almost all ships here, except the SW awing/bwing/corvette/jedi fighter/slave1 ship pack from Porsche, and the Whitestar Cruiser, get them from LR and copy the ships directories(awing,bwing,corvette,jedi,slave1 for SW ship pack and Babylon for the white star) into Freelancer\data\ships.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Michael, Thanks for taking the time to respond.
<br />To answer , no, I did have the Div x 5 Pro bundle installed, but after finding this problem, I uninstalled it and Hard booted my machine. Sadly the problem continues. I have most recently downloaded an update for AC97 from microsoft windows update, and this has not cured it either.  As stated earlier, if i de-activate the mod, and play Freelancer as microsoft intended, I have no problem !  WeIrd Huh ?</div>

			<div class="content">Apologies for wasting your time !
<br />
<br />I have turned hardware accelaration on AC97 all the way down, and mod plays fine now, albeit with reduced sound quality.
<br />
<br />Compliments on a fine update to an extremely good game !  I definitely like what you have done to the ships. Extending the upgradeability for engines , Scanners, etc.   Pleased to see escape pods for sale ! More ways to increase earning capacity !  And am I right in assuming enemy shields recharge if you give em a chance ?
<br />Nice one Michael .  I cant wait to see how far you can run with this!

			<div class="content">Great mod, makes it fun to play the game all over again.
<br />
<br />However, seeing that the mod has 'rebalance' in its name I could not help wondering about the laser weapons. They got a 20% increase in firing rate but the damage per shot was not decreased accordingly. As a result they are now one weapons class too good, compared to other weapons types (just like the graviton shield in the original game). The Justice series of laser guns is even worse as it got a speed/range boost in addition to the damage boost, without any energy penalty whatsoever ... This doesn't seem very balanced at all.
<br />
<br />Also, in default mode (level 2) NPC shields have less than normal regen while the shield damage factor has been increased from 0.5 to 0.6 and NPC loadouts have been changed to several times the original damage output (at least in SP missions). This seems odd. Full regen with the original 0.5 damage factor would have been nice as one level of a <b>rebalancing </b> mod.
<br />
<br />BTW, any chance getting repair bots like in Privateer? That would make it possible to abolish shield batteries and nanobots altogether. They are too much like the coloured potions in games where you battle witches and dragons.</div>

			<div class="content">The infocard for the Piranha shows 5/2 hard points, shiparch.ini shows 6/2, yet when I bought one I only got 4/2.
<br />
<br />Somehow I've got a feeling that the numbers do not quite match.
<br />
<br />Now I have to go back to an earlier savegame and escape from Liberty all over again, because I've found a Dagger that also has 5/2 on the infocard. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Slap: first download the babylon5 pack and also porsche's SW's ship pack. I hope you are using FLMM. Install the porsche's ship pack by double clicking it. It should auto install into FLMM. Now go into the Freelancer mod manager/mods/Porsches_StarWars_Ship_Pack/Data/. Copy the ships folder and paste it into Freelancer mod manager/mods/flrebalance10bfull/data/. It will say that there is already a ships folder bla bla. Just click yes to all. For the babylon 5 pack, go and unzip it somewhere with folders on. Next just copy the whitestar cruiser folder and paste it in freelancer mod manager/mods/flrebalance10bfull/data/ships. And Bob's your uncle! The starwars ships and the white cruiser should be installed properly. Oh yeah, only after you have done all that do you enable the rebalance mod.

			<div class="content">1. D/L the Babylon 5 Ship Pack and change the filename to read &quot;babylon5_ship_pack.zip&quot;
<br />
<br />2. Create a directory in FL\DATA\SHIPS named &quot;babylon&quot; (it is CASE SENSITIVE!!!).
<br />
<br />3. Extract the files whitestar.mat, whitestar.cmp, and whitestar.sur from the White_Star_Cruiser file in the zip archive into DATA\SHIPS\babylon directory you just created.
<br />
<br />4. Make a back-up copy of the r_cruiser.ini file located in DATA\SHIPS\RHEINLAND directory and copy/paste the r_cruiser.ini located in the White_Star_Cruiser file into the directory just listed here in this step.
<br />
<br />5. Now heres the kicker, there is a file in the zip archive named &quot;extra.dll&quot;. Take that file and copy/paste it into the FL\EXE file.
<br />
<br />6. Change your Direct3D settings to mipmap at &quot;Best Quality&quot;.
<br />
<br />7. Run FLMM v1.1 and activate the &quot;Ghost Docking RIng&quot; mod so you can dock with planets. It will not conflict with FLRBM v1.0 Full.
<br />
<br />This will hard mod the game, so if you update the game, remove it before you do so.
<br />
<br />Enjoy!

			<div class="content">Thanx Doomsayer for posting the quick tutorial here as well. but as I was saying in the comments, there is no need for that extra.dll file, because names and inofcards for the white star were already converted and imported into my modinfo.dll.
<br />   Radiation thank you too for tutoring the newbs...i have increasingly little time and i'm dedicate it mostly for modding and less for tutorials.
<br />   Everybody use the quick tutorial from Doomsayer, except for that extra.dll part.
<br />   Astralli, i'm glad you solved your sound problem after all, everybody please do the same if u have a board with AC'97 codec, activate hardware acceleration for it. and yes the npc shields now recharge in 2 ways, half in level1 of difficulty and FULL in levels 2 and 3. also the armor class in level 3 is better for all npc ships.
<br />  Pati-aoh, u have the same problem as astralli, activate the hardware acceleration option on your AC'97 codec and everything should be fine.</div>

			<div class="content">Sherlog, looks like i overlooked u. I have explained why i made lasers fire faster and further. it's because they were alredy downscaled in the original version. a justice mk III(class 3) makes a damage of 24, while a Barrager mk 1(class 2) has a damage of 30 at the same firing rate in original FL. Or, i wouldn't call that balanced especially that the graviton shield is the mos encountered shield type and also the best(even in my mod) so the laser will do very little damage against that, both your and especialy the NPc's. U are right about 2nd level though, it sholud have the normal 0.5 shield damage/out of hull rate. but remeber that its giving u an advantage as well as u'll also do increased damage against enemy shields. 
<br />I thought about those repair bots as well, maybe i can make a piece of equipment that can in fact slowly regenerate hull's emulating a hard working repair bot. THAT will be more realistic than repairing the hul instantly as it happens know. Than upgrades will be possible like a &quot;Stable ship Bot booster&quot;, to make the bot work faster on the hull, this is from a game called 'Nomad' sout somewhere in 96 i think, very cool as idea and feeling as well.</div>
