			<div class="content">Chapter one
<br />
<br />	Jonathon stared deeply into the murky blue beverage that sat on the bar in from of him; it was the kind of look of someone in deep concentration. He was an aging man from Manhattan, physically dilapidated, it was evident that time had taken its toll on him. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;So my friend, what are you drowning yourself in tonight&#8221; came a familiar voice from behind.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I have no idea&#8221; replied the tall unkempt man, never removing his gaze from the bubbles swirling within the glass, distorting the world beyond it. Seemingly out of nowhere Jonathon chuckled, amazed that the world could be more distorted than it was already. He knew he had drank far too much, but he didn&#8217;t care. His home wasn&#8217;t what he remembered it as from his childhood. Manhattan&#8217;s streets were becoming more violent every day, the youth struggling to find the funds to feed their insatiable desire for cardamine. One reason for his sorry state was that he had contributed to the social demise. The cardamine runs to Manhattan had set him up for life, but now it wasn&#8217;t much of one to live.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You ok?&#8221; came the voice from behind him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, wha? Oh&#8230; righ&#8217; yeah, sorry&#8221; replied an obviously intoxicated Jonathon, remembering his friend behind him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think it is about time we got you home&#8221; replied Thomas; he was younger than Jonathon. The shorter athletic man was from Bretonia and was Jonathon&#8217;s business associate, or partner in crime, depending on who was talking. Thomas paid for the drink, and lifted the aging man off of his barstool; it was a wonder how he managed to stay on it in the first place.
<br />	Once the bretonian managed to get his companion out of the bar, he hailed a cab, normally he wouldn&#8217;t, but his friend was in no shape to walk down the street, and he figured that his chances in a cab would be better than risking the streets below. After struggling to get the staggering, mumbling drunkard into the cab, Thomas gave the pilot the address of Jonathon&#8217;s apartment, and sank back into his chair, bewildered as to how he ever ended up in this mess&#8230;

			<div class="content">ok the last chaper was kinda short... anyway here the next one...
<br />
<br />Chapter two
<br />
<br />The men had been running cardamine for over a decade, the older flew the dromedary while his partner flew cover. Thomas liked his drake. It was a Kusari light fighter, but its appearances were deceiving. In the hands of a pilot like himself, the drake was deadly; it had the firepower to take on any other fighter in Sirius, and was nimble enough to avoid the powerful weaponry encountered in the border worlds. This was there they acquired their goods, from planet Malta to be exact, where the outcasts sold it by the tons. They knew that creating an addiction through the colonies would gain them power, and weaken the house systems. 
<br />About a month ago the two men had arrived at Malta to pick up their next shipment, the same time, at the same place as they always did it. But on this particular occasion there was something wrong, Jonathon could sense it. Out of the shadows emerged an elderly looking outcast man, it was the same merchant they always bought their goods from, but he had some friends with him, holding very large powerful rifles. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;You betrayed my brother,&#8221; he growled as he approached the two gentlemen, &#8220; He&#8217;s been arrested by the LSF because of an anonymous tip.&#8221; 
<br />&#8220;This is ridiculous,&#8221; thought the bretonian &#8220;we don&#8217;t even know this guy&#8217;s name, how could we turn in his brother? And above all why would we turn in anyone who is associated with the outcasts?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think there has been some sort of a misunderstanding,&#8221; replied Jonathon, he was more experienced, and he did most of the talking during the transactions. &#8220;I honestly have no idea what you are talking about, why would I turn any outcast into LSF? That would just draw more attention to me, attention I don&#8217;t need.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You are in no place to lie your way out,&#8221; replied the trader, his companions tightened their grips on their guns. &#8220;My brother&#8217;s aid managed to get away and said that she saw both of you collect the reward for his capture.&#8221; He paused, as he tried to analyze his former customers&#8217; expressions and then continued, &#8220;He was a powerful drug lord in liberty space. He funded much of the pirate activity and smuggled in much of the cardamine that exists there. It seems you two believed if you removed his business then you could be the sole suppliers of liberty.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Thomas couldn&#8217;t help but laugh; this accusation was ridiculous. They were just aging men looking for a quick way to create a retirement fund. To supply liberty would require multiple trains, not to mention an army to protect them. How could this man accuse them so irrationally?
<br /> 
<br />The angered merchant turned towards Thomas immediately, his cold dark eyes met the bretonian&#8217;s deep blue ones. He stopped laughing immediately as he felt this man&#8217;s gaze penetrate him like a sword. A shiver went down his spine, as the mercenaries across from him raised their weapons. Everything slowed to a crawl as Thomas heard the whine of a dozen pulse lasers charge up. He swallowed hard, any second now a hail of focused energy would cut him down. He knew it would all happen too fast for him to feel it, but he winced anyway.
<br />
<br />	At this Jonathon took a flash grenade out of his pocket, it was old, and he wasn&#8217;t sure if it would even work, but it was his only hope of saving them. As he pulled out the pin a small red light illuminated, but Jonathon didn&#8217;t have the time to check. He tossed it at the gunmen&#8217;s feet, and sheltered his eyes as it emitted a blinding flash of light. Thomas was dazed, but had managed to avoid being exposed to the full force of the grenade. Both men turned and ran for the door, Thomas&#8217;s run was more of a stager before the dark spots in his vision disappeared, then, being more physically fit than his friend quickly caught and passed him. The dazed gunmen blindly fired a few shots, but they quickly stopped when they realized that there were oxygen canisters everywhere, and if one of them were hit the chain reaction would bring the whole building down. 
<br />
<br />	Jonathon was heaving by the time he made it back to his dromedary and he struggled to clamber on board. Thomas had already gotten back to his drake, and was already making the preparations to leave. The drake roared to life, spewing out fire, its engine growling like its namesake. The dromedary&#8217;s start up was a little rougher; Thomas thought his friend had gotten that fixed. As both started to lift of small arms fire arced out of the darkness and started to hit their shielding, but it did little but annoy the pilots. They cleared the docking rings quickly, but it was soon apparent that they would not have an easy passage out of the system. As swiftly as they had engaged their cruise engines for the jump hole to omicron beta, a patrol group of 5 sabres appeared on their huds&#8230; then another emerged from Malta&#8217;s docking ring. This wasn&#8217;t going to be easy&#8230;</div>

			<div class="content">im not comletly happy with the way chapter two came out, parts didnt flow well... but anyway heres the next chapter, as things start to heat up...
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Chapter 3
<br />
<br />	&#8230; Thomas knew that if either of them were going to get out of this he was going to have to fly like he had never flown before. The sabres were rapidly closing on their position, soon they would be in range to fire their cruise disrupters, and when that happened they were doomed. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Keep heading for the jump hole&#8221; Thomas shouted to his friend, his nervousness was poorly hidden, &#8220;ill try and distract them long enough for you to get through the hole.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The dromedary would not hold out very long against the sabres&#8217; powerful weapons, Jonathon&#8217;s only chance was to get to the hole before the outcasts go in range. Thomas punched his cruise off, a bit too hard, but he had a feeling he might not be using it any time soon. There was another problem that also hovered in the back of his mind, omicron beta was controlled by the outcasts as well&#8230; they wouldn&#8217;t be safe till they got to the luxury liner Hawaii in the sigma 19 system. Thomas knew it would be a miracle if they got that far but he couldn&#8217;t give up now he wasn&#8217;t going to be the next casualty due to cardamine. He shook himself to his senses &#8220;one problem at a time&#8221; he told himself and he pulled his drake through a tight 180 to face the sabers, this was about to get ugly. 
<br />
<br />	Just then he saw a cruise disrupter arcing towards the dromedary, and with that he threw his throttle to full and hit his afterburners as he shot after it. he managed to catch it with a perfect shot from one of his Wakizashi lasers. Suddenly his own missile lock alarm went off, and he instinctively pulled into a hard barrel roll, dropped a countermeasure, followed by a half inverse loop and soared past the sabres. He knew that he wouldn&#8217;t survive in a five to one match up, but all he needed to do was by his friend time. As he quickly turned his ship around he saw two of the sabres engage their cruise engines, they were going after the dromedary. Thomas roared as he pored everything he had into the back of the closest sabre, and he easily managed to stay on its tail as it tried to lose him. Just as the shield dropped he saw the turret turn to face him, he rolled upside down and destroyed the shield generator with a few well-placed laser shots. He then hit his afterburners and shot straight up, the wyrm shots from behind, and the shots from the turret barely missed him. Thomas looked over his shoulder to watch the unshielded sabre burst into flames, he laughed as he heard the angry curses from the man who had just killed his comrade. 
<br />
<br />Just then his laughter was cut short as he watched Jonathon struggling to fight off the two sabres. The second group was almost in range by now and he pressed his cruise button and prayed he hadn&#8217;t damaged it earlier. They roared to life as he was slammed back into his seat, he hit the countermeasure switch and strafed to one side as a cruise disrupter rocketed past him. As he approached his friend it didn&#8217;t look good, the dromedary was on fire and wouldn&#8217;t hold on much longer. Thomas dropped out of cruise just in time to watch the dromedary erupt into flames. He looked on horrified. His friend was gone, the sabres turned to face him. Just then his sensors picked up something large amongst the wreckage, it was an escape pod. He hit his thrusters again and tractored in the pod.
<br /> All he could do now was run, he new if he attempted to engage cruise he would be immediately swarmed with disrupters. He kept his hand on the thruster button and headed straight for the hole. He then hit the slide switch and swung his ship around to face the oncoming ships. He started firing at them, scoring hits, but they did little. The outcasts shots were not very accurate but they were starting to land more hits, and the others were getting close. He had been traveling in a straight line too long. He swung his ship around again, and turned the slide off. The sudden change in momentum threw off the perusing ships. He began swerving back and fourth, randomly hitting his thrusters, making himself as hard of a target as possible. But his shields were failing; he was so close to the hole&#8230; just a bit further, time went by agonizingly slowly as he watched his shield energy draining. His shields fell and his hull started to take damage rapidly, the left foil got ripped off as he entered the hole, &#8220;that was way to close&#8221; he commented out loud. He hit his nanobot button and lent back in his chair. He breathed a sigh of relief, and remembering his friend in the hold radioed to him. After a few expletives Jonathon confirmed he was all right, but cramped, and needed a strong drink. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Let me get us to safety before you start mentioning strong drinks&#8221; growled Thomas, just then he emerged from the hole, in front of him over a dozen fighters waited, their guns trained on the hole, Thomas swallowed hard.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is it&#8221; he heard come over the radio, Jonathan&#8217;s voice had a tone of apprehension.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Find something to hold on to&#8221; Thomas muttered vainly trying to hide the hint of hopelessness in his voice, &#8220;This is going to be rough&#8221;</div>

			<div class="content">ok, heres the next chapter, what do you think of it?
<br />
<br />-------------------------------
<br />
<br />Chapter 4
<br />
<br />	 Through the cockpit glass Thomas saw eight sabres converging on his position, and he was sure the ones he just scrapped by in omicron alpha would be quick to follow him through. As he engaged his cruise engines again Thomas muttered &#8220;maybe I can loose them in the nebula, and then hopefully slip through to sigma 19 unnoticed.&#8221; He knew this would not be true, assuming he could loose all the fighters closing in on him, the fact he would be trying to escape through to sigma 19 would be obvious, he would die in the omicrons. 
<br />	As soon as he engaged his engines, the waves of cruise disrupters came again, he was sick of this, he pulled his ship skillfully over one, and the rest had to take wide turns to come up behind him; by then he was heading full steam towards one of the sabres. Before the pirate knew what was happening, Thomas slammed right into one of the pirate&#8217;s ships, if it wasn&#8217;t for his enemy&#8217;s shield he would have put the nose of his drake right through the very heavy fighter&#8217;s canopy. The drake ricocheted off the heavier ships shields, Thomas immediately put more power to the shielding, and smiled as the 6 cruise disrupters that managed to tail him slammed into the sabre with such force his ship was disabled. The com channels filled with angered chatter, it sounded like that particular ship was the wing leader&#8217;s, and he didn&#8217;t take insults too well in front of his men. His ship floated lifelessly in the middle of the nebula, but Thomas didn&#8217;t wait long enough to gloat.
<br /> The strategy seemed to have worked, and even though his shields were damaged, he managed to disappear into the nebula. The sharp angle the collision caused him to make catapulted him beyond visual range of the pirates, and it all happened so fast that the dumbfounded pirates could do nothing but listen to their leader&#8217;s complaints. The trip through the system was quiet, probably too quiet, but Thomas used the time to collect his thoughts and plan how he&#8217;d get through the next jump hole, he knew there would be a welcome party for him, and his luck was bound to cut out soon. Thomas heard some groans come over the private channel. 
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Uuuhhhhh&#8221; came a faint noise followed by a quiet cough &#8220;my&#8230;. Head&#8230; whhhha&#8217;&#8221; continued Jonathon, dazed from Thomas&#8217; latest maneuver. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;You ok back there?&#8221; asked the pilot, realizing maybe he should have warned his friend of his plan
<br />
<br />&#8220;Where am I? What&#8217;s going on? Why does my head hurt?&#8221; Jonathon whimpered. 
<br />
<br />It sounded like he had hit his head quite hard. &#8220;Have your restraints on Jonathon?&#8221; Thomas requested, &#8220;I told you to hold on.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8230; who is this? &#8230; Where are you&#8230;?&#8221; Thomas heard Jonathon begin to thrash around his escape pod, he assumed his friend must be looking for him, and appeared to have lost his memory.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Jonathon, its your friend Thomas, we&#8217;re in a bit of a tight situation here, and in trying to get out of it you must have hit your head. Sit back down in your chair, put on your restraints, and try to relax, this is probably going to get bumpy again.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wha&#8217; oh, hi Thomas, what&#8217;s going on? My head&#8230; it&#8217;s throbbing,&#8221; said the man in the cargo hold, &#8220;what happened?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain later,&#8221; said the pilot, starting to get a little aggravated. &#8220;We&#8217;re approaching the Sigma 19 hole now, strap yourself in and shut up, this could get ugly.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />As the small fighter got closer to the jump hole, Thomas noticed something strange; he still hadn&#8217;t picked up any enemy ships on his scanners, no ships at all for that matter. As he got within 2 kilometers of the hole, there was still nothing on his scanners; the eerie silence began to worry him. Nothing appeared as he dropped out of cruise to enter the hole, he feared what he might find on the other side. There was no reason to stay in omicron beta, and it would be suicide to. Whatever was on the other side of this hole, he would be ready for it. 
<br />
<br />He entered the hole and the familiar dizzying swirl engulfed his ship. These jump holes were incredible, natural phenomena that acted the same way as jump gates. He was surprised that even now so few people knew about their existence. There were stories of pirates disappearing into nebula, and flight groups emerging out of asteroid fields and assaulting patrol groups throughout the house systems, but no one had taken the initiative to go see what was in there, except for a diminutive group of traders, freelancers, and bounty hunters. Thomas was starting to regret that he had kept his trade runs a secret; the additional traffic would help keep him safer.
<br />
<br />Suddenly he noticed the exit of the hole approaching swiftly. His grip on his flight stick strengthened, and the ship barely had time to slow as he emerged from the hole before he was activating the cruise. His hand stopped mere millimeters from the switch when he realized the space around him was desolate, there was always a little traffic around a hole, one side or another; this was getting creepy. Remembering his friend was hurt, and not wanting to find out why everything was so quiet, he engaged the cruise and swooped out if the gas cloud. He headed towards the Hawaii, there was also the Gas Miner Ogashawa, which could be a quieter place to lay low for a while, but it would also be easier for outcasts to get to them, the security was much better at the Orbital spa and Cruise liner, and after that run Thomas felt like he deserved a little relaxation in a five star resort ship. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;How yah holding up back there&#8221; asked Thomas. He waited a few seconds and repeated the question, but there was no response. 
<br />
<br />Thomas quickly turned his radio to an open channel, &#8220;luxury liner Hawaii, this is freelancer Alpha nine eight seven, requesting emergency docking. I have an injured person on board requiring immediate medical attention.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The worried shaking in his voice wasn&#8217;t missed on the commander of the ships docking facilities who responded, &#8220;ok Alpha nine, the docking path is free, proceed to pad one, we&#8217;ll have a medical team waiting for you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thanks&#8221; replied the anxious pilot, who waited till the last possible minute to turn off his cruise engines. He entered the ship and set his ship down. Once the escape pod was out of the hold, a crew had to cut it open, it had been grazed by a few shots in omicron alpha, the opening mechanism was broken and the glass was black. Once they got the pod open, he saw his friend slumped in the chair, he had a large gash in his head, and he was unconscious, at least Thomas hoped he was only unconscious. The medical team carefully took him out of the pod and placed him on the stretcher floating next to them. While two rushed him off to the infirmary, one stayed behind.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your friend might be in infirmary a few days&#8221; he told Thomas, &#8220; I&#8217;d suggest you get yourself a room, and enjoy the facilities here, by the look of you and your ship, it looks like you&#8217;ve earned it. I&#8217;ll keep you updated with your friends condition.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Thomas proceeded to the main lobby, if he looked as bad as he felt, he must look like hell. Judging by the looks he got from guests and employees alike, the worn out pilot realized he must look pretty lousy. When he got to the lobby he walked up to the main desk, and after an initial shocked reaction, the lady asked, &#8220;How may I help you sir.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221; replied Thomas, &#8220; I&#8217;d like a room, anything will do, I don&#8217;t care just something that has a bed and a shower.&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok sir&#8221; she replied in an annoyingly cheerful, squeaky voice, &#8220;and how long will you be staying with us?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; responded Thomas, wanting to get the transaction over as quickly as possible&#8221; here&#8217;s 10 thousand credits, just set up a charge account for me for the bar and casino, and subtract the amount of each night I&#8217;m here from that&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok sir&#8221; she chirped, &#8220;enjoy your stay, here&#8217;s your keycard, you&#8217;ll be in room 56792, oh and sir, I&#8217;ll have to request you leave your side arm at the front desk, we don&#8217;t permit weapons on the ship.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I got this far with it&#8230;&#8221; he responded slyly, and with a cocky almost threatening tone continued, &#8220; I think I&#8217;ll hold on to it.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very well, sir&#8221; the lady responded with a slight quiver in her voice. And turned to her computer as Thomas left. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now to find this room,&#8221; he mumbled to himself, &#8220;56792? Why do they make these things so big, where&#8217;s an information console, or I&#8217;ll never find this place&#8221;
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />Suddenly he was jarred forward and snapped out of his dream and back into the present. The cab had arrived at Jonathon&#8217;s apartment, he turned and looked at his friend with disgust as he lay drooling on the chair on the opposite wall. He paid the pilot and dragged his friend out of the cab. The bretonian opened the door, and fought to get his friend to his room before finally dropping him on his bed.  collapsing onto the couch Thomas muttered in exhastion under his breath, &quot;I'm not going to be able to take much more of this&#8230;&quot;

<br />Question. Your story seems to say that your main character's friend was taken to medical, yet you have him with the main character as they get into the hotel room.

			<div class="content">ohhh, ok maybe i need to make that clearer, most of the story so far is a flashback while they're in the taxi going from the bar where thomas found him in the beginning of the story, he was jarred out of his daydream by the cab stopping at the apartment building...  does that make sense? ill try to make it a little clearer, i guess being the writer, it was obvious to me =P

<br />EDIT: does that make it clearer?

			<div class="content">ok newest chapter, sorry its been so long....
<br />
<br />-------------------------
<br />
<br />Chapter 5
<br />
<br />&#8230; Thomas stared at the dark ceiling for what felt like a lifetime. He was sick of babysitting his friend who had refused to touch a spacecraft since their last cardamine run that had almost gotten them killed. He began to look around the room, attempting to discern all the different dark shapes that filled the room. He knew the room well, from the dark sheen of the metallic walls, to the light colored fabric of the chairs. The apartment contained few pieces of furniture, just what was in it when Jonathon bought it, there was little point spending credits on furniture for a room that, up until now, had been rarely used. He noticed the strange form the table and four chairs in the kitchen made against the faint glow of the hypo-cooker. The apartment was not very big, just three rooms this one, a bathroom that was far too small, and the one Jonathon was asleep in. 
<br />	
<br />Suddenly a small light started blinking on the view screen, Thomas drowsily turned towards it, and stared at the hypnotic repetition the red light was creating. Before he had a chance to see what the message that the light was indicating was, he slipped off into a deep sleep, and right back to the week on the Hawaii.
<br />
<br />-***----***-
<br />
<br />After an hour of searching Thomas finally found his room. He opened the door to a ridiculously &#8220;efficient&#8221; room, as Orbital Spa and Cruise calls them, which is just a marketing way of saying sardine can. He was surprised to find a change of cloths laid out on his bed, but found a not that said &#8220;if you need your clothing laundered place them in the receptacle near the door, and we will get them back to you within 24 hours.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />After one of the most refreshing showers of his life, Thomas dressed in the light cotton pants, and ridiculous shirt provided for him. He had seen most of the other guests wearing similar outfits, so his embarrassment was quelled slightly, he just did not want his friend to see him in such attire. Making his way to the casino, the Britonian passed by interesting restaurants, as well as relaxing spas, finally arriving at the relatively new casino. The room was filled with different games, bright colored lights, and people from every house of Sirius. After taking in the casino, Thomas sat down at a black jack table. Blackjack was an ancient came of chance that was deceptively complicated. The game is played between you and the dealer, often with six to eight packs of cards. The object is to get twenty-one, without going over. Each card is worth the number on it, except face cards, which are worth ten, and aces, that can be worth either eleven or one. 
<br />
<br />Thomas swiped his room card &#8220;welcome to the Hawaii Mr. O&#8217;Riley&#8221; the dealer said courteously, &#8220;I assume you know how to play?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;As well as you know how to deal those cards&#8221; said Thomas.
<br />
<br />The dealer smirked slightly and dealt two cards to Thomas after he placed his bet of two hundred credits; he received two aces. Thomas turned them over and split them. He placed another two hundred credit bet next to his first. He indicated with his finger for a new card on one ace, the dealer dealt a king. Thomas tapped the other ace; he got a three. He tapped it again, and this time he received an eight. He now had a twenty-one and a fourteen; he tapped the second ace again. He got a two this time. He now had sixteen, a hard choice. He indicated for another card, he got a four. He now had a twenty and a twenty-one. The dealer turned over his cards exposing a nineteen; Thomas won two hundred credits.
<br />
<br />Thomas played long into the night, finally ending with a profit of twenty thousand credits. &#8220;That&#8217;ll make up for some of the damages from the botched trade run&#8221; he thought as he returned to his room. It was obviously late, as most of the halls were empty, just the occasional employee and giggling couple. When he got to his room, he stopped suddenly. He cautiously went in and turned on the light, half expecting the clich&#233; &#8220;man in the dark corner&#8221; moment. Fortunately no one was there, and after checking the rest of the room, and dead bolting his door, Thomas fell into a deep sleep.  
<br />
<br />The rest of the time on board the Hawaii was quite uneventful, and after a few days Thomas was allowed to go and visit Jonathon in the infirmary.
<br />&#8220;How you holding up&#8221; Thomas inquired to his incredibly bored looking friend.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh fiiiiiine&#8221; Jonathon replied sarcastically, &#8220;this place is great, wonderful view of a beautifully white wall, so interesting to stare at its amazing ability to not change, simply fascinating&#8230; you must be so jealous, you have to go to the casino, and the pool, while I&#8217;m here with this great white expanse before me&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, ok, I get the idea, don&#8217;t get your panties in a bunch. The doctor said that you&#8217;ll be released from his care tomorrow morning. I&#8217;ve managed to find someone who&#8217;s willing to sell his ship. I figured you wouldn&#8217;t want to spend the flight back to Manhattan in the cargo hold of my Drake&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What? So I don&#8217;t even get to enjoy the cruise ship&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look we&#8217;ve been here too long as it is, we need to put more distance between ourselves and Outcast space&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine, whatever, just get me out of this god forsaken room, I&#8217;m starting to notice inconsistencies in the paint&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Britonian chuckled &#8220;Ok, you get your beauty sleep.&#8221; Thomas said with a smirk as he left the room, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you bright and early tomorrow morning.&#8221;
<br />
<br />After he left Jonathon Thomas went to the hangers to prep his ship, and to reserve the spot next to his once it freed up. He then preceded two levels up to some other hangers where an elderly man waited next to a Defender. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are you Mr. Pildman?&#8221; Thomas asked as he approached the aged gentleman.
<br />
<br />The man gave a slight nod and replied, &#8220;You must be Thomas O'Reily.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The men shook hands, William Pildman had been a freelancer most of his life, but old age was beginning to get the better of him, he had come to the Hawaii to retire, before a pirate did it for him. He turned to his ship, &#8220;well this is it, she&#8217;s pretty old, but is structurally sound. I&#8217;ve made a few improvements, increased her power cell, traded it for a Rhineland one, so it mounts class seven weapons, she also takes class seven shields.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wow, must have surprised a few unsuspecting pirates&#8221; Thomas mused
<br />
<br />&#8220;More than I can count, sadly&#8221; the old man said, his wrinkled face sinking, &#8220;it&#8217;s a shame the universe is what it is, that humanity is what it is&#8230;&#8221; he stared off into nothingness for an instant before continuing &#8220;but of course, there&#8217;s nothing you or I can do to change that, so I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re hear so our humanity doesn&#8217;t get the better of you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s one way of putting it, is the price we agreed on still acceptable?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Definitely, I have no use for anything more&#8221; replied the man 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok, well I&#8217;ve transferred it over to your neural net account&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good luck, young man, may Sirius treat you kindly.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s about time it does&#8221; Thomas responded, as he climbed into the cockpit of the ship. He engaged the start up sequence as the old man looked on with a sad face, watching decades of memories lift off of the landing pad. As he turned he smiled, knowing he&#8217;d never have to fly another mission, and could finally relax.
<br />
<br />Thomas took the ship for a quick flight around the planet before redocking with the Hawaii and proceeding to his reserved landing pad. This ship was not as nimble as the Drake by a long shot, but it was definitely a better ship for Jonathon to be flying&#8230;
<br />
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />
<br />edit: Wow just noticed a huge continuity error, i can believe i missed that, lol (wrote jonathon instead of Thomas in the ship-buying scene). i had to read this thing again so i could write my next chapter, sorry its been so long, for those who care...
