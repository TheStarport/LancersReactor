			<div class="content">Okay, well, as promised, here's the teaser/preview/intro. I'll try to get the first chapter up soon, but I am in school and I will write at my own pace. Anyways, here it is and I hope you like it.
<br />
<br />Holocaust: Teaser
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Planet New London, New London system
<br />
<br />Stardate 1372.03.14  March 14, 1372 A.S.
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sit &#8216;em down over here.&#8221; A middle aged man ordered, and three guards practically threw Frank Johnson into a hard metal chair. He looked across the desk and saw the man who had ordered the guards to &#8220;sit&#8221; him down, and then looked over his shoulder to the guard that had been the roughest with him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, thanks a lot you turd lickin&#8217; dick.&#8221; Frank said to the guard in his sarcastic, Houston accent. Frank remembered being in a fight a couple of days before. He had knocked two men out before the bouncer finally tasered him. &#8220;I appreciate the hospitality and everything but what, no tea or crumpets? Well, how &#8216;bout some coffee? I want it black with two lumps of suga-&#8220; 
<br />
<br />Frank stopped in mid-sentence as a fist slammed into his lower jaw. He bit his tongue and could taste blood in his mouth, which he spat onto the floor.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Shut up.&#8221; The guard ordered.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Leave us, but wait outside the door in case there&#8217;s any trouble.&#8221; The man at the desk said in a very thick Bretonian accent. The three guards left the room
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now Mr. Johnson, you aren&#8217;t gonna give them any reason to come back in here are you then?&#8221; He waited as if expecting an answer, then continued.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good, now, let&#8217;s get down to business. You remember me don&#8217;t you? Three days ago,  you were brought in here fighting from the New World&#8217;s Pub? They were moving me to this new office that night. You kicked the man who was carrying my box of valuables, and you broke my statue.&#8221; He said, pulling out a ceremic sculpture, about a foot high. The statue was of a man who looked exactly like the one across the desk, a woman and two little girls. The man had his hand on the woman&#8217;s shoulder, and his other on the little girl&#8217;s head. They were positioned as they were posing for a picture. The woman&#8217;s head had been broken off, and so had the little girl&#8217;s arm. A crack ran down the man&#8217;s face and through the small girl right in front of him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Nice kids.&#8221; Frank said in his smart ass tone.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Anything to say for yourself? Didn&#8217;t think so, now about your little visit here last night?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;C&#8217;mon sheriff, I got into a bar fight.&#8221; Frank replied sarcastically.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just a bar fight? You head-butted senator Kelly after you punched congressman Jones.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh he head-butted me!&#8221; Frank said, irritation clearly in his voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There were eye-witness accounts that he did no such thing!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh whatever.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Anyway, on to the point. After they let you go the other day, I got to looking at your records. Theft, robbery, burglary, do I need to continue?&#8221; He asked, a hit of anger in his voice. Frank didn&#8217;t say anything.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh but wait, there&#8217;s more. Assault, obstruction of justice, resisting arrest, public drunkenness, and concealment of a firearm. Not to mention all of the little tricks you pull. These aren&#8217;t just little childhood pranks, as I&#8217;m sure you know, no.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You goin&#8217; somewhere with this?&#8221; Came the smart ass remark from Frank.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;re a con-man Johnson, who feeds on the week and  preys on the poor, just for your own damn profit. Tell me Mr. Johnson, how do you live with yourself?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I get by.&#8221; Was the only response that came from Frank. His lips puckered slightly, his head went down, but his eyes still maintained contact with the man at the desk.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;re not even worth what it would cost to convict you and send you to prison for the rest of your life. Hell, you&#8217;re not worth the effort for a person to pull a trigger on a gun and send you straight to your resting place.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;And your point is?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Frank Johnson, I want you to leave Bretonia, and never return under any circumstances. And if you do, I will personally cut your stomach open with a rusty knife and strangle you with your small intestine. Do I make myself clear Mr. Johnson?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Frank said nothing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good, your ship for Curacao leaves in two hours. Once you pass through that Jumpgate into the Cortez system, I want you to never come through it again.&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Deep in Kusari space, a man began to have severe muscle spasms. He coughed up blood, lost his vision and his breathing became labored. He had been having horrible nightmares the days before. But, about twenty other people in his research institute were in the same situation. However, these twenty-two people, were just a small glympse of what was yet to come. This, was only the beginning.

<br />Twenty bucks to whoever can tell me what the deal is with those numbers. I'll give you a hint: They have somthing to do with a guy named Hurley.
