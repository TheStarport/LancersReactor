			<div class="content">Ch. 12
<br />
<br />	&#8220;HOLD ON GUYS!&#8221; yelled the captain.
<br />
<br />	Alvaro looks out towards the cockpit, and sees that the battleship is beginning to fire at their ship. Lasers blast past the ship and those that hit sends everyone into the wall. 
<br />
<br />	&#8220;YOU,&#8221; yelled the captain, &#8220;Hit the rear pressurization plate as soon as we hit that ship!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	The ship gets closer to the battleship and all of the turrets aim towards the ship and pounds it.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Diverting all power to the shields! ETA 10 seconds to impact!&#8221; yelled the captain.
<br />
<br />	Alvaro grabs the wall of the ship and brings down his visor. 
<br />
<br />	The ship begins to rapidly accelerate and blasts past the barrage of lasers. The ship jolts around and Alvaro holds on the railing even tighter. He sees the hull of the battleship in front of him, and hears the grinding of the hull. The ship jolts, and sends Alvaro into the other side of the ship. 
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Alvaro&#8230;.&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Hey&#8230;.&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Wake up!...&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Let me take care of this!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro begins to awake, and feels a searing pain in his rear.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;What the&#8230;&#8221; said Alvaro.
<br />
<br />	He rubs his head and looks towards the ship door. He sees it open, and sees some laser shots flying off in different directions. Alonso goes towards him and picks him up. &#8220;Come on kid!&#8221; yelled Alonso, &#8220;We need to join this party!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro struggles up and picks up his helmet and his weapons and runs out side. He sees pieces of the battleship hull spread out across the deck. He turns behind him to see the hole that the ship left, but sees a massive, tan piece of metal covering the wall on the exterior.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;What the hell are you standing around for!&#8221; yelled Alonso, &#8220;That thing there is deployed from the ship as we crashed to make sure that we all don&#8217;t get sucked out! Get going!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alonso runs off towards a shattered blast door, and Alvaro follows. The two proceed down the scarred hall way, and arrive where the other Corsairs are fighting. Alvaro takes a position behind some fallen pieces of hull. He pokes his head above his cover. He sees men in green suits firing rapid shots of laser fire towards the Corsairs. Alvaro clicks the safety off his rifle and fires at a Hessian. His shots pierce through the Hessian&#8217;s helmet, and bloods spews out from his face. The two other Hessians are quickly dispatched. Alvaro hears some noise in his helmet, and sees the name &#8220;Captain Francisco Cruz&#8221; appear in his visor.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Listen up!&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;I am uploading the ship&#8217;s map to your helmet. We are planning to make our way towards the central railway system, and make our way from there towards the bridge. From there, we are to commandeer the ship and set the AI to attack the Rheinland fleet. We will use the ships onboard here to return to the Hispania, or use the escape pods to the surface of Crete. Either way, we will have control of the ship to do with as we please. Follow my lead!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	The captain runs down the hall way, followed by the other corsairs. Alvaro falls in behind Alonso. They rundown the hall way, firing at any Hessian they come across. They enter into what seems to be a bar. They walk slowly across the empty bar, walking over the pieces of glass on the ground. Alvaro looks over to his left, and sees the bar table. He sees a bright light and hears a sound.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;DUCK!!!&#8221; he yelled.
<br />
<br />	All the Corsairs jump to the ground. The air is suddenly filled with laser bolts flying across the room and slam against the wall. The room gets filled with dust, making it impossible to see. Alvaro reaches over to the side of his helmet and hits on the infrared button. His vision gets filled with red, and he can see the dim outline of two men. He aims his gun towards the two men and fires out some laser shots towards the men. He watches as one of them drops to the ground. The other Hessian jumps over the bar table and rushes towards Alvaro with a knife in his right hand. Alvaro pulls out his own knife, and quickly reaches towards the Hessian&#8217;s right wrist, and thrusts his knife into the Hessian&#8217;s abdomen. The Hessian steps backwards, and falls to the ground. Alvaro bends over and pulls out the blood-stained knife. He flips off his infrared and sees that the dust had settled. He looks around and notices that his teammates have left.
<br />
<br />	Odd&#8230;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro starts walking to a door on the other side of the room, and reaches down to his right wrist. He punches in some commands, and sees some transmissions.
<br />
<br />	Huh&#8230; I guess I was too busy fighting to notice these&#8230;
<br />
<br />	He sees a transmission from his captain. &#8220;People! I&#8217;ve sent Cruz and Carlos to set explosives on the vents. Turn on your infrared scanners and follow me out!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro moves up the list, and sees a timer.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;00:20&#8221;
<br />
<br />	OH CRAP!
<br />
<br />	Alvaro dashes towards the bay door, and looks down at the time.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;00:05&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro sprints faster, but the room explodes, sending Alvaro flying downwards into a hole and slamming into the bottom. He struggles up and looks upwards through the hole, and sees that the room has turned into a flaming inferno. 
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Captain!&#8221; said Alvaro, &#8220;Are you there?&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Yes Alvaro!&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;Where the hell are you!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I seem to be at a hallway below the bar room. I didn&#8217;t get that message that you&#8217;d blow the room to pieces. Why&#8217;d you do that? There were only two Hessians!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;We didn&#8217;t waste explosives on them. If you notice, the bar room is connected to the barracks and guards quarters. We were simply slowing down the guards. Anyways, proceed down that hallway until you reach an elevator. Take that up to your level and find us.&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro looks ahead of him and sees the hall going stretching downwards towards an elevator. He cautiously approaches the door, gun ready. He reaches the elevator and pushes the elevator door. He stands in front of the door and hears the elevator come down. The door opens up and he sees two Hessians. The Hessians look at Alvaro oddly and pull out their guns. They start firing at Alvaro, but Alvaro jumps off to the left. He pulls out a grenade and throws the grenade around into the elevator. Alvaro hears the screams of the Hessians, and an explosion erupting out of the door. He smiles a bit, but then realizes what he has done.
<br />
<br />	OH CRAP! The elevator must be&#8230;
<br />
<br />	He runs out of his corner and looks through the door. He sees what is left of the elevator, small pieces of metal dangling by a thin rope. He looks up the shaft and sees the rope going up the whole shaft. 
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;It&#8217;s now or never&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro jumps out towards the rope and grabs it. He climbs up the rope, and keeps an eye above him. Some pieces of metal fall from the ceiling, right towards Alvaro. Alvaro swings the rope out of the way, dodging the metal. He sees that the metal keeps falling from the ceiling.
<br />
<br />	Damn&#8230; They must be in a deep battle up there!
<br />
<br /> 	He climbs up the shaft, dodging the pieces of metal that are falling. He goes up until he hears the noises of firing, and stops climbing. He throws a sticky bomb onto the door, and hits a button on his wrist. He swings backwards, watches the small explosion, and swings through the small opening. He flies into the hole and slams into a wall. He struggles up and looks down the hall, where he sees some laser shots. He runs down the hall until he sees his fellow corsairs, firing their rifles. He dives behind some fallen metal, and sees that he is next to Alonso.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;What the hell is happening here?!? You seem to be in a big mess here!&#8221;
<br />	
<br />	&#8220;Our path crosses over the hangar bay. It&#8217;s the only way into the ships railway system. And apparently, they were expecting us.&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Cut the chatter!&#8221; shouted the captain, &#8220;Concentrate on those Hessians!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	 They all fire at the Hessians, who were taking cover behind the ships. Suddenly, one of the Hessians gets into the dagger and fires into them.
<br />
<br /> 	&#8220;OH FU*K!&#8221; said Alvaro, &#8220;Is that guy insane!&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Alvaro and the other Corsairs go down on their bellies. Alvaro looks over at a corsair, who is holding a rocket launcher. He looks over at another, who is holding a rocket launcher as well. The two fire at the Dagger, and the rockets slam into the dagger. It flies out of control and hits the bay door, causing it to crack.
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Alright guys!&#8221; yelled the captain, &#8220;We need to run like hell! This hangar bay is going to depressurize soon! Unless you want to have an early grave, get on my tail!&#8221;
<br />

			<div class="content">Ch. 13
<br />
<br />&#8220;WARNING! HULL BREACH IN MAIN HANGAR BAY!  REPAIR TEAMS AND NANOBOTS REPORT TO THE MAIN HANGAR BAY!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Follow me!&#8221; yelled the captain.
<br />
<br />The corsairs ran after the captain, who made a bee-line towards the door across from them. Alvaro feels a hand on his left shoulder.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Come on kid!&#8221; yelled Alonso, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d like to have a grave floating forever in space!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alonso dashes towards the company of the Corsairs, and Alvaro dashes towards him. He runs along, dodging the falling pieces of debris and moving out of the way of fleeing Hessians. One of the corsairs begins opening fire on one of the fleeing groups of Hessians. The captain slaps down the rifle.
<br />
<br />&#8220;HOLD YOUR FIRE SOLDIER!&#8221; yelled the captain, &#8220;Focus on running, unless you want to join them in space!&#8221;
<br />
<br />They run further, closing into the bay door; it begins to close.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh crap!&#8221; yelled the captain, &#8220;Corsairs! Dash and roll quickly!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The corsairs run quickly and dash towards the closing door. Alvaro prepares to dive, but he trips in the process.
<br />
<br />Oh crap&#8230;
<br />
<br />He slams into the ground face first, and gets back up on his back. He looks at the closing door ahead of him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait!&#8221; cried Alvaro
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sorry kid!&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;We can&#8217;t risk all of us getting killed!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro watches the door bolt shut, and looks towards the crumbling dagger wedged into the wall.
<br />
<br />Oh no&#8230; Only something miraculous could save me now&#8230;
<br />
<br />The dagger explodes, and Alvaro covers his head and closes his eyes. 
<br />
<br />Wait&#8230; Why aren&#8217;t I dead yet&#8230;?
<br />
<br />Alvaro stands up straight and looks towards the bay door.
<br />
<br />What! No hull rupture!
<br />
<br />The intercom comes on over the ship&#8217;s system.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tertiary bay doors closed. Hangar bay repressurized. All crew members evacuate from the hangar bay and await repair crews!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro lets out a sigh of relief and proceeds towards the closed side door. He turns on his team frequency.
<br />
<br />&#8220;HEY IDIOTS!&#8221; yelled Alvaro, &#8220;I&#8217;m still alive! Open the damn door!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The door opens up, with a Corsair standing at the controls.
<br />
<br />&#8221;Hey Lieutenant!&#8221; chuckled the Corsair, &#8220;Sorry about that&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yea yea&#8230;&#8221; said Alvaro, I&#8217;ve heard it all before&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br /> The corsairs proceed towards the rail cars. They hop into one of them and proceed towards the control. Alvaro opens up the computer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Battleship Kitzingen rail way system. Please select a destination&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro scrolls down the selections and clicks on &#8220;control level&#8221; The rail car blasts straight and increases in speed. Alvaro sits down next to the captain and begins talking to him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;So captain,&#8221; started Alvaro, &#8220;What will we do when we reach the bridge?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well,&#8221; started the captain, &#8220;We&#8217;ll neutralize all resistance and try and commandeer the battleship for our own use. If that doesn&#8217;t work, we&#8217;ll have to program a suicidal course into Crete&#8217;s atmosphere or into another battleship&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Before Alvaro could finish, many laser shots blast over their heads. They throw themselves down on the deck and look behind them. A gang of Hessians are speeding up on them in another rail car.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Corsairs!&#8221; yelled the captain, &#8220;Open fire!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro goes against the rail car wall and aims his weapon over the wall and fires a shot. One shot lands into a Hessian, causing his blood to blast out of his head. More shots blast towards the car, hitting Alvaro in his arm. He falls over and grasps his arm.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Lieutenant!&#8221;  yelled the captain, &#8220;Are you ok!&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Yea&#8230;&#8221; grunted Alvaro, &#8220;This is nothing&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro pokes his head above the wall, and sees that only two more Hessians have been killed, still leaving 5 more. He struggles upwards and picks up his grenade off his belt.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Screw this!&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;Time to end this!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;WAIT ALVARO!&#8221; yelled Alonso, &#8220;DON&#8217;T DO THAT!&#8221;
<br />
<br />But it was too late. Alvaro throws his grenade into the car. The explosion destroys the car, sending the Hessians flying into the electric rails. The rail car goes flying off into the distance, slamming against the rail and destroying much of it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn it Lieutenant!&#8221; yelled the captain, &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to make it! There is no way to stop this car in time!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro looks towards the nearing chasm, and notices the rail bent upwards. He rushes towards the control console and increases the speed to as high as it can go.
<br />
<br />&#8220;WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!&#8221; yelled the captain.
<br />
<br />The car speeds up and blasts towards the chasm. It goes up the short ramped rail and flies over the chasm, landing on the other side. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221; sighed the captain, &#8220;That solves one problem&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;One Problem&#8217;&#8221;, questioned Alvaro.
<br />
<br />The captain points to the front of the car, towards the closing door of the bridge level.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8221;, he sighed. The captain turns around and yells
<br />
<br />&#8221;BRACE FOR IMPACT!!!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro dives into the floor of the car, and feels the impact of something on his back. He falls over and blacks out.
<br />
<br />When Alvaro wakes up, he struggles up, throwing a piece of debris off his back.	He looks around, and sees that he is underneath the overturned rail car. He crawls underneath a small opening, and opens up his hud in his helmet. He opens up a transmission from Alonso.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey Alvaro! We had to go without you, but we would be right ahead. Sorry for that!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He struggles up and proceeds down the scorched hallway. His vision is blurry, but he manages to go in the right direction. He suddenly hears some screams ahead. He begins running down the hall, following the screams towards the bridge. He goes in and is blinded by the bright light. He looks around, only to see the bodies of his fallen Corsairs. He sees Alonso against the wall, and rushes towards him.
<br />
<br />&#8221;What the hell happened!&#8221; yelled Alvaro.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Run&#8230;&#8221; grunted Alonso, &#8220;Something isn&#8217;t human here&#8230; RUN!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro hears another scream and looks upwards, and sees his captain, impaled by an odd, blue extension from a hessian. The creature turns pulls out the projectile, dropping the lifeless corpse of the captain and turns towards Alvaro, showing his glowing, blue eyes. Alvaro can see that what ever the Hessian is, it is not human. Under the man&#8217;s armor, there are odd blood-tipped projectiles piercing out wards, moving around like snakes.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;, said the Hessian in a ghostly manner, &#8220;Another fresh body for the taking&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />End Ch. 14
<br />
<br />Sorry for the short chapter guys!
