			<div class="content">This Reply contains Spoilers! If you don't want to ruin your gameplay don't reed this!!!
<br />
<br />
<br />	First of all, I need to clarifying some things, and I will began with the &quot;example of what seems over selling a ship&quot;, and I will refer only to the &quot;UnModed&quot; Freelancer, and SP only.
<br />	I will explain. The game starts in Manhattan, when for the first time we see some ship for selling, and for what option (money, lv. player) we have, the Patriot it's the best choice. Latter when we find other ships (almost always is a better ship!) it's normal to &quot;seems over selling&quot;, because at that point they are! That is applying to all the ship we think are over selling.
<br />	Now, let's compare the stats of the Patriot with the stats of other ship in his class namely Starflier, then we'll see it is not a ship to not taken in consideration! Besides why the House Police have it? Starflier is more maneuverer than the Patriot, which is his great and single advantage. But this advantage comes with a price, minus one gun, no cruise disruptor and a small cargo hold.
<br />	Here I need to make some clarification.
<br />	In Liberty the majority of the ship are Light Fighters (LF). Fast, easy to handle and more important light weight. Or you can not build a ship with that characteristics if it's loaded with heavy weaponry and an ample cargo hold! So, basically if you want to buy this kind of ship you need to take in consideration this facts. No big weapon and no big cargo hold! Now, let's move on...
<br />	Patriot is a House Police ship and they don't need a big cargo hold, they only need speed an agility to catch those pirates! And because police ship acts always in groups, they don't need turrets either. On the other hand, Pirates need a big cargo hold to make contraband. But to have it, they sacrifice the speed and agility. And because they almost always go alone, they need those turrets to defend their back!
<br />	That's why, for a Freelancer, pirates ship are best &quot;suitable&quot; for his needs, and everyone want to take them.
<br />	But don't forget a Freelancer is between good and bad. So, if the Patriot is a perfect ship for good guys and the Bloodhound for the bad guys, theoretical for a Freelancer none of them are good enough. The perfect ship for him is between two of them, and this ship it's not in the game! (Unmoded of course!) 	Now, some players liked the good guys and some the bad guys, that's why every player of this game have different favorite ship, and this is one of the  strongest point of the game.
<br />	That is almost all, about Light Fighter, but this  characteristics is applying to the Heavy and Very Heavy Fighters and even to Freighters, as well.
<br />	Now, few words about Dagger. Dagger is a lv. 4 class ship, and in Liberty is the most advanced in his class. In my opinion it's more like an Medium Fighter here in Liberty. So, it's normal to have it! But, if the Dagger have some more competition, lv. 4 fictional Juni Defender, let's say, then I don't know who will taken anymore. 
<br />	Apropos I think (my opinion) the Juni Defender is the most beautiful ship in the Sirius (after X-Wing, of course), I've spoken! ;-D
<br />	Anyway, in Liberty I prefer Defender with 3xJusticeMk2 + 2XScorpion and 1XStunpulse turret, nothing will stand a chance in front of me, especially when I have a cruise disruptor on board. Nevertheless, I need to aim very carefully because will run out of power very rapidly, but that's the fun of it, I think...
<br />With this ship I will go even in Bretonia, but I need to changed because I don't want to beet Bounty Hunters forever!
<br />	Now... my favorite ship. Truly I don't have one, I buy the ship which is best &quot;suited&quot; for my needs, but if I think a bit I will say it's the Drake from Kusari. I like his agility and even the sound of the engine. Can carry good weapon, and I don't mind she can't take torps, like I said before I never like them.
<br />	And I don't prefer GMG weapons! I like tachyon cannon especially from the Outcast. But that's before I put the hand of the Nomads Cannon. Then I take something (usually turrets) with high refiring rate just to keep the enemy Missile and Mine away from me. (This is a hint and who was playing the old sims from Lucas Art knows what I'm talking about)
<br />	About thrusters. Well, that's why they are in game, to be used. Without them you can't: dodge missile, escape, turn around your enemy, go through a minefield or gas clouds, between interrupted trade lane, etc. Enough for you? Let's move on...
<br />	About Sunslayer torpedo... End of story! ;-(
<br />	Anyway, I will end this replay before someone kick me out from this Forum, and becoming more boring then it is!

<br />3x Pyros Type 3 (Outcasts)
<br />1x Borroco
<br />
<br />That is one of the good ship setups from one of my favorte sites, drunken Lancers. Its for the Barracuda. This setup looks really nice. Borroco for shields, Catapults for big kick, and Pyros just to kick some butt! But theres a catch, does anyone else think this might take up alot energy on the Barracuda? i mean, i no it has okay power systems, but when i put like 6warriors on it, i could get off a good 10shots, wait, did i say that before? *shrugs* oh well. So 3 type 3 pyros guns would take up alot of energy, Borroco on a Barracuda would be nice tho. Hey, ill give this setup something, its really imaginative. Big Applause to guys over at Drunken Lancers! Tell me what u think of this setup.</div>

			<div class="content">4x Adv.Scorpion (Xeno)
<br />1x Stunpulse Turret
<br />
<br />Thats a setup for the Dagger from Drunken Lancers. I am reading over these Setups for the ships and think there really great! but, there is a wee bit o a problem, although im sure it would hardly come up if you pilot this fine ship correctly. Check the turret. A stunpulse. Good for takin dem cops shields down! But, if you have 10 cops on ur tail, all brandishin' their CD's. So you cant pull out of ur hit and run attack on cruise. Your thrusters are going down, and u need to go to turret view and take a couple o these suckers down. But the Stunpulse will only take their shields down. The stunpulse turret has hull damage of 4. You only have so many mines left. So i did find the downside that you have to be a really good pilot to make a hit and run with this setup so u dont get caught in that situation. But you have to be good to use the Dagger, [My favorite ship!! effectiviely.  What do you think of this. Overall tho, i do like this setup, it perfectly takes advantage of the Dagger's heavy forward firing armaments. What do you think of this?</div>

			<div class="content">I will try this one... Monday !!! But, I amost know the result.
<br />Stunpulse Weappon it's effective on PVP, because after the shield it's down they drain the power of the ship and let the enemy player without energy to fire his weappons. Not working on NPC, unfortunately...

			<div class="content">Ah, I almost forget. The Stunpulse weapons don't work against Nomads either! In some Mods it's vital to have stunpulse based weapons because the NPC regenerates their shield like you do, maybe more...
<br />In Liberty your Dagger with the Adv. Scorpion is the best you can get.
<br />And this is one of my usual ship.
<br />If you like so much Dagger try the Just for Fun Mod v.3. There is 4 or 5 variants of Dagger.
<br />BTW. give me a link to Drunken Lancer to see what they have!

			<div class="content">Am I the only one here who flys a Sabre? I mean, COME ON! The Titan flys like a capital ship for petes sakes! The Sabre has, in my opinion, the best weapon to maneuverability ratio. I can take on 8 ace barracudas in my little sabre baby, but I'd get clobbered if I were flying anything else.
<br />   It deeply disturbs me that no one else on this thread named the sabre as their favorite craft. I feel lost, hurt, and abandoned. I may cry. Doesn't ANYBODY out there like the Sabre???</div>

<br />
<br />May I ask your expertise for Dromedary?
<br />
<br />As I have mentioned before, my favorite ship is Dromedary with.. well, Kusarian technologies... Suncannon and Tantos (because the opposing forces had destroyed my weapons recently).
<br />
<br />And today, I got a call that the day after tomorrow, there will be a huge battle... my clan against 2 other clan...
<br />
<br />Do you have any idea to spice up my Dromedary? 
<br />
<br />PS: I can shoot missiles too!!
