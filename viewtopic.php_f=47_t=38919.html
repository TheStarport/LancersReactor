			<div class="content">Log Entry: Planet Hamburg, Hamburg System, Rheinland Space
<br />
<br /> Well, here I am, I&#8217;m actually doing it. I&#8217;ve gotten my way here somehow. I&#8217;ve purchased one of those Rheinland Military fighters, the Valkryie, and outfitted with some looted weapons I got doing their contracts. I&#8217;ve got half a million to my name and am heading out to see the fringes of space, high adventure. I half suspect I&#8217;m crazy.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Hamburg Jumphole, Berlin System, Rheinland Space
<br />
<br />  That was close, decided to check out some rumours on a Hamburg to Berlin Jumphole in one of the nearby asteroid fields, turns out it was true. The Hessians, Unioners, and Bundschuh all agree on one thing, that I should die. Got out of that one by making a quick jump, made a quick getaway through the fields and found another jumphole to Dresden. Even the Junkers don&#8217;t like me, maybe I can find someone to fix my rep.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Lava Field, Dresden System, Rheinland Space
<br />
<br />  No wonder Dresden has some much Hessian activity, there&#8217;s a massive asteroid base in the sulphur clouds! Good thing I was on cruise or I would have been dead for sure. I docked at the Leipzig Base or something, Daumann Heavy Construction base. One of the workers there told me about a base near Schultz in Omega 11. He said you have to go through Stuttgart, which is a jump to Berlin, then a jump to Stuttgart, to get there, unless you use one of the jumpholes. These jumpholes are handy things. One of the Bounty Hunters told him after a couple rounds of drinks. I&#8217;m heading out now.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Solarius Base, Omega 11 System, Omega Border Worlds
<br />
<br /> Oh man, nearly bought the farm on that one. First I enter the system from a jumphole from Dresden, and find myself being shot at by all kinds of pirates, Unioners or Bundschuh, couldn&#8217;t tell and don&#8217;t really care who they are, I managed to skirt over to the gate to Stuttgart and a Military patrol took them down. I always liked those guys. I met up with a Daumann convoy and followed them to Solarius Base, its always on the dark side of Scultz to keep out of the radiation which is everywhere. They say they&#8217;ve lost a lot of fighters out in the Van Rohe belt, Van Rohe was some explorer who found the system and bought the big one doing it. There&#8217;s no official maps, but one of the BHG patrols have decided to let me come along if I help out. They probably know what they&#8217;re doing.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Planet Deidus, Omega 11 System, Omega Border Worlds
<br />
<br /> Oh God, that was dangerous. We flew out and engaged some Hessians, simple enough we had them down, then two more wings came in. At that point we decided to flee, my path to Solarius was blocked and they were coming in from all directions. I left the planetary fragment field and headed straight for the Van Rohe belt, the radiation was immense, my ship hull was feeling it, the computer giving all kinds of warnings, I enters the belt and took a hard right, rabbiting for Deidus. I barely made it, the Hessians broke off back for the safety of the fragment fields. The radiation was pretty bad out there, spotted several wrecks of those who died trying to make it rich on the diamonds. I spotted another jumphole and when I feel good and ready I&#8217;m going to go through there. But first better get the nanobots reinforcing my hull again.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Freeport 5, Omega 41 System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br /> Thank the maker for neutral Zoners. The Omega 41 system is worse than Omega 11! Atleast you could hide from the radiation in Omega 11, out here the entire planetary fragment field is irradiated by that neutron star, the closer you get the greater the radiation. Ouch! I picked up some communications signals from across the system and discerned it was a Freeport, a neutral station operated by the Zoners. I had to make it through a Hessian-Corsair battlefield, with mines and crossfire and everything, but I eventually made it. On the plus I found someone who could smooth my reputation over with the Corsairs, had to pay with 125K credits, but it was worth it to get them off my back. He says they have a base around this system and there&#8217;s a jumphole to their home system, Omicron Gamma. I might take a look there, only problem is I hope this keeps quiet, the Corsairs aren&#8217;t liked much in civilized space and I am a civilized person, just with a flair for adventure. The Zoners are pretty okay, pretty neutral. They have another Freeport in Omicron Theta, I passed the jumphole to there apparently. Mabye I should go there, I don&#8217;t really know.

			<div class="content">Log Entry: Leon Base, Omega 41 System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />  I headed out to see the last pit stop in this system, Leon Base. It&#8217;s a Corsair base, but you see a few Zoners here and there and the rare Freelancer who has been accepted into Corsair society. They&#8217;ve got some really high quality equipment out here, their top ship, the Titan, is unbelievable. Better than anything I&#8217;ve ever seen. They wont let me take it for less than 770K, only reason they would sell it was because of my reputation as a Hessian killer. I don&#8217;t have that kind of credits after that bribe, or hell before that bribe. I&#8217;ll head for the bar and check out the mission directory.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Planet Crete, Omicron Gamma System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />  I&#8217;m here. I don&#8217;t know how, but I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m on the homeworld of the Corsairs, Planet Crete. Its like a desert out here, I can&#8217;t believe how the Corsairs have managed to get this far. I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself though. I took an assassination mission against a noted Red Hessian leader, Karl Van Something-or-Other, I went out there, passed the jumphole to Omicron Gamma, and got to the waypoint. Not much around there, just two of his cronies and a lot of rock. The two went down then I don&#8217;t know how many Hessians showed up but they just swarmed and swarmed, I identified my target and went at him. Most of them had used up their nanobots  just surviving out here so when his shields were down I knew I had him, I dug into his hull with my blasters, stolen from destroyed Hessian ships, and eventually blew him away. The Hessians didn&#8217;t like that one. I did the only thing I could do. I went full speed for the Omicron Gamma jumphole. They were smart enough to let me go. So I came out in this orange cloud, asteroids floating about. I spotted a downed Bounty Hunter elite ship but decided to leave it for now. The Bounty Hunters eyed me oddly but let me pass. I made my way out of the Cloud and saw Crete and its moon against the green background of the mysterious Edge Nebula. I flew out and landed after passing Tripoli Shipyards. Now I find myself in the bar, seemingly welcomed by the Corsairs for my exploits against the Hessians. I seem to have an appreciation for them I never had before. Its just that out here day to day life is a lot harder than what I had at Planet Denver- I saw some Corsair kids running, and playing Corsairs and Bounty Hunters, the Corsairs won of course. Dropped by the ship dealer, and although they&#8217;ve accepted me they can&#8217;t just give away the ship. I&#8217;ve got to prove myself worthy. Maybe someone in the local bar will have a mission for me, I never liked the Bounty Hunter&#8217;s anyways.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Planet Crete, Omicron Gamma System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />   I feel good, and I knew that I would. I just hunted the Hunters, caught the catchers. I got a mission for 155K against Jason Bradley, a hell of a Bounty Hunter born and raised on Houston. I had to fly out to the wispy edge of the local Edge group nebula and get his escape pod. Simple enough, except it was 5 against 1 and they all had better ships and guns. But I did it, I took them down. A few more of those and that Titan will be mine. I don&#8217;t think the Bounty Hunters got time to positively ID me, but still there aren&#8217;t too many Rheinland Heavy Fighters around these parts, mostly Titans, Hammerheads, and Sabres. Heading back to the bar now to meet up with my Corsair contact.
<br />
<br />Log Entry: High Orbit around Crete, Omicron Gamma System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />  Some Sabre flying yahoos with better equipment than brains are harassing me. They&#8217;ve got all kinds of torpedoes. The Corsairs are not pleased, they patrol about 3K around Crete constantly with regular long patrols in the system. I&#8217;m heading back to Crete, eventually the Corsairs will kick them out. This is idiocy.</div>

<br />
<br />  Well, I&#8217;ve finally gotten myself a Titan. But that&#8217;s a long story, well not really, but that sounds cool anyways. I had accepted a mission to head out that Edge group nebula and track down a Bounty Hunter who stole a list of base locations throughout Sirius. I found him and his buddies heading out of the cloud. It was a pretty tough fight, it was close but I got the last hit with my guns blowing away his cockpit. I tractored in the debris and found the base list. The trouble is they got an ID on me and all the BHG is going to be hostile with me now. But I can take them, this is one hot ship. Most of my weapons are way below max specs for her. Now that I&#8217;ve got this ship the Corsairs have offered me something they offer very few outsiders- a chance into the family. They&#8217;ve decided to me put me through a ritual. I&#8217;ve got to fly out to that green nebula and find an alien artefact. They say the area is guarded by strange spirits and ghostly alien ships, but I somehow doubt it, probably only Bounty Hunters looking for inexperienced pilots and radiation. In any case I&#8217;m ready for it. Launching now.

<br />Log Entry: Sector E4, Omicron Gamma System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />  Well, I half expected more. I didn&#8217;t stumble onto this &#8216;Graveyard of the Innocents&#8217; but I did manage to get a load of artefacts. Heading back to Crete now to complete the ritual, I hope-

			<div class="content">Log Entry: Planet New London, New London System, Bretonia Space
<br />
<br />I just realized I havn't updated my log recently. Where did I leave off? Oh yeah, I was coming back from the Ritual heading to Crete when all of a sudden seven Bounty Hunters Guild ships came in from the left and right and caught me with their cruise disrupters. I heard the voice of the lead over the comm, &quot;End of the Line for you, Corsair Lover&quot;. I responded alright, not with words, but with my guns. I blew off his engines and guns and left him to drift for a while as I engaged his buddies. The Titan is a bit more sluggish than other fighters, but it can take a beating. I did managed to dodge two incoming fighters, making them RAM INTO EACH OTHER! There was just one Bounty Hunter left in the fight. He was smart and broke off the engagement, tractoring his leader's disbaled ship with him. I landed on Crete and received a Corsair's welcome. The next day, the afternoon of course, I set off to Bretonia to sell the artefacts on the black market. I moved through Omega 41 and then onto Omega 5, a real rocky battlefield in the Barrier. And I thought Omega 41 was a battlefield, this is all out way between the Corsairs and Hessians. After a pit stop on Cadiz I made the jump to Cambridge and took the legal route to New London, no scans, I still seem to have a good corporate rep. Heh, those days seem behind me now. I've loaded up with some light arms and am heading back to Corsair space now. Looks like I'm in with them, for now atleast. And I'll keep better update of the logs from now on.</div>

			<div class="content">Log Entry: Cadiz Base, Omega 5 System, Border Worlds
<br />
<br />I'm in the thick of things now. Omega 5 is a true warzone, and I'm the latest combatant. I was heading back to Omicron Gamma, thinking I'd investigate rumours of strange alien ships in the Graveyard of the Innocent, so I come to the Omega 41 jumphole and its swimming, absolutely swimming with Red Hessians, weapons platforms and an asteriod base! How did they get that there? I made my way back to Cadiz to report this. The Elder there concripted me into the role of Corsair Elite and I flew out to the Hammon Hole to judge Hessian strength. My patrol of 4 Centurions and myself in a Titan engaged numerous Hessians. I lost two but we took down a total of 16 that day. I headed back to Cadiz to make repairs and mount some new looted weapons. 
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Cadiz Base, Omega 5 System, Border Worlds
<br />
<br />Just made a major break through in the Corsair fight against the Hessians! But I'd better start from the begining. It was a routine combat mission into the Hammon Hole when we spotted several Dromedaries being escourted by Hessian Sabres. I fired a cruise disrupter but it went wild and I couldn't catch up with them. The next day I got a mission to terminate Karl Strauzimmer. When I went to the waypoint what did I see? But an Eagle with a Zoner Transponder, I flipped most of my active systems off and deployed my landing struts on a nearby asteriod. I listened to their conversation, the Zoners were doing the hauling for a hefty price. I waited for the Zoner to leave and then terminated Karl Strauzimmer with extreme predujuce. I reported this back to the Cadiz Elders. 
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Omega 5 Jumphole, Omega 41 System, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />Mission accomplished, just blew away half of the Hessian presence in Omega 5, woo! One of our agents at Freeport 5 in Omega 41 confronted the Zoners and theatened them, they caved in and gave the location of a gap in the weapons platforms, straight 'above' (as determined by the Hessian base) the target. Me and a sqaud flew out right away and were soon in a heavy battle with the Hessians. Ships were going down everywhere, my sqaud blew away the weapons platforms and a Titan specially modified with stolen Bretonia Armed Forces torpedos blew away a sweet spot in the Hessian base. I went for it with my guns and BOOM! Hahaha!
<br />
<br />Log Entry: Planet Crete, Omicron Gamma, Edge Worlds
<br />
<br />Time to update the old logs, so I'm heavily outfitted now.. I stumbled upon two great finds, I feel lucky. The first of which was the Volsung, a Hessian Elite fighter. It contained two... well they're human weapons, but they look like something out of Zone 21. They're really powerful, tear hulls to shreads and depletes shields. Depletes your power supply also. The second find, well I'll put that in the logs in more detail later, someones calling me over for a drink.

<br />Never logged what the second find was. Now this sounds crazy, sure enough, but I know what I saw and have the HARD PROOF! I met up with a Corsair, the Corsair who saw the alien ships. He was doing pretty good for himself actually, going on covert missions in an Eagle. I asked him if he'd show me the Graveyard of the Innocents, where he found the jumphole and saw the alien ships. He was reluctant at first, but knew my rep has a good pilot. We were flying out to the sector shortly after. Nothing too dangerous heading out, encountered some Bounty Hunters but they backed off pretty quick when they saw it was me. We arived and he showed me the area. I knew he was getting a little scared to say the least so I told him I wanted to check out the aliens alone. He headed back to Crete, and later I would learn that was a pretty smart move. All of a sudden four blueish purple, I.. Its hard to describe, they look biological, but they dont, they look energy based. They openned up on me straight away with insanely powerful weapons. I started dodging and knew what they meant by 'Slayers of the Innocent', a novice pilot would be eaten alive by these.. these things. I managed to get one down and that seemed to turn the tide, it seems like two got angry and one got evasive. They went down one by one until one started to flee, I blew him away using the weapons from the Volsung. I surveyed the left over wreckage, it was dispering and decaying fast. Tractored in three gun like objects, their blasters. All of a sudden the threat detector went off again, more aliens on the way. I engaged them and took their weapons as well. I was running low on bots and batteries so I headed back. When I got to Crete I spoke with one of the mechanics I knew well, he had a look at them and was shocked. He wasn't expecting real evidence of the aliens. The strangest thing is the guns, the Energy Blasters, had hookup technology for Colonial ships. He made a few modifications and threw them on. I tested them, they hit pretty hard (not as hard as the looted Volsung weapons) but heres the thing, they don't drain the batteries! Amazing. So- Wait, gotta stop here, someone wants to talk to me.

<br />Well that was weird. Sort of like those old ancient Earth movies about men in black. This guy shows up, sure enough wearing black, and talks to me about my find. Apparently I ran into what are called the Nomad's. He said he worked for the Order, there used to be alot of news about terrorists in the group the Order, but that was dropped a while back when that Trent guy was pardonned. I think the Corsairs mentioned the Order before.. in pretty high regard... Anyways, he said the Order delt with most of the Nomads, and have been watching some active alien relics as well as these Nomads out here. Says the Nomads here are different, the ones here and around the Outcast homeworld, apparently the ones they delt with were released after a Rheinland archeological expeditions but the ones in Alpha and Gamma have been around for as long as the Corsairs and Outcasts remember. He said its nothing to be majorly worried about and they're keeping an eye on it, but also said they'd be in touch if they needed to. Very very weird.</div>
