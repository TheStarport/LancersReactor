<br />
<br />
<br />Chapter one
<br />
<br />
<br />It was a typical dark reddish night on leeds, the last rays of the sun peeking through the smog. The typical space-traffic and bustle in the central city core added a semi-relaxing hum to the background. Rowan Thompson stood on a balcony above this, strangely soothed by the life of the city around him. He took time to casually smoke a cigarette and watch the planet. As he watched he reflected back to himself about how rarely he ever just watched this city, or any place. He also noted how different the place appeared to be under context. Up here at this time, quiet and relaxing. Down there somewhere not too far away, the opposite of relaxing.
<br />
<br />Down there, somewhere not too far away:
<br />
<br />
<br />Friedemann Haynsworth stood on his rooftop in the cold dark of the night. He watched on the horizon as the slow moving ships in the lower atmesphere cast spotlights that broke the occasional darkness. Something terrible had happened that day, something most men if not disturbed by would acknowledge the graveness of the event. Friedemann accepted it, his role in it, not lightly however he did not acknowledge its significance over anything else. Its was people did, what they had to do. Besides, he reminded himself, nature itself is cruel and brutal to what stands in its way and doesn't regard somethings age, gender or innocence. Downstairs, in a empty room a t.v crackled and buzzed...
<br />
<br />If your just tuning in right now, today there was a terrorist attack in Leed's central core. Unknown gunmen stormed the Liberty embassy and executed several unreleased members of both Brettonia's government and Liberty's. Police and the military stormed the building and killed several gunmen and are not commenting on if any of the terrorists have survived. Unfortunately the Police and military were not on the scene until the hostages had been executed...
<br />
<br />Friedemann smiled, even though assets were lost he accomplished what he wanted. His interests and investments were quite insured to protection and profit.
<br />
<br />****ty morning:
<br />
<br />John Amry smiled over his morning coffee. He giggled to himself even. He was living in a luxury suite in the Shetland liner in  Edinburgh System and he didn't earn any of it. He had been a washed up mercenary who wasn't quite good at what he did, but good enough to have his name of several lists. Two weeks ago he had a job offer, it came with a advance payment and a free suite on the liner. All he had to do was wait there for further instructions, and he didn't mind waiting at all. He smiled to himself again and sipped back the fine blend of beans. Life was good, and finally to him. He was already beginning to fancy himself a play-boy bad-boy. His morning was rudely interrupted by yelling outside his door and a loud bang as his door crashed down. He stood up and began to draw his pistol but a rifle butt to the back of the head and then the stomach caught him off guard. He crashed to the floor and before he could realize what was going on a boot stomped down on the top of his head.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oi! Bloody bastard went down easy. He gunna wish he was dead&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ha! Think we oughtta 'stop him from resisting' s'more?&quot;
<br />
<br />John looked up through his dazed eyes to see to Bretonian military uniforms complete with gas masks and riot helmets to accent their large rifles. That was the last thing he saw before a large boot smashed back down on his face.
<br />
<br />His face ached quite a bit, he noticed as he came too. There was a very bright light in his eyes, making his awakening all the more unpleasant. He squinted his eyes and could make out the shapes of people sitting behind a desk several feet away. He grumbled slightly, still not having the energy to inquire about the nature of his capture and the group that had done it.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mr. Amry, as i'm sure your well aware of why we have you here...&quot; A cool Brettonian voice uttered from the shadows.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhm, no.. Not a f*ckin' clue at all actually, and my bloody f*ckin' head hurts too, y'know&quot; John grunted painfully
<br />
<br />&quot;Well right now i could care alot less about your head and much more about 15 people dead. Important people&quot; The voice calmly retorted
<br />
<br />&quot;Well then go deal with that an' leave me the f*ck alone&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh i am dealing with that right now, as you clearly don't see, i consider you responsible. Right now your consider a terrorist against the Brettonian empire and shall be dealt with accordingly so&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The hell are ya' on? I've spent the past week scratchin' my ass and drinking fancy booze, that ain't no crime. You f*ckin' arseholes just burst in and break my bloody f*ckin' nose for no reason&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh and i'm sure you have reasons, lots of them, for why you would assault liberty's embassy and kill members of both their governments and ours? In fact the way you spend the rest of your life may depend on your compliance on this&quot;
<br />
<br />John scowled and stared at the floor. The pieces were fitting together in his simple-minded head. He had been set up to be taken down, most likely so someone else could lose heat. Or at least buy time. Either way, he was in the proverbial ****tier and he could either play ball and hope for the best, or just sink.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright, you made a slight mistake in this though... I didn't organize it, but i know who did...&quot;
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />Friedemann answered his loudly buzzing comm-piece as he walked across a landing pad towards his private shuttle.
<br />
<br />&quot;Friedemann speaking, who is this?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Friedemann, its your neighbouring asset. Heres the intel for you, they went for the straw-man perfectly.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Do we know his defense? I doubt he's rolling over on it&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No sir, as you can imagine the Brettonian government is taking this one seriously. There aren't any leaks... yet&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Either way, we must proceed now and not later... Find out when the competition gets here more formally, we'll take this to the next level then&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Understood... Out.&quot;
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />Rowan lay back on his bed, closing his eyes. The holster on his leg dug uncomfortably into him. He tilted the visor on his helmet down and began to doze off. Moments later a loud beeping interrupted his rest.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mr.Thompson our buddies in blue are going to be arriving in 4 hours, we need you acting security detail. High suspect of terrorist involvement on this one.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Mhm.. roger that, anythin' to do with the blues has high terrorism alert&quot;
<br />
<br />Rowan was referencing to the civil unrest in Liberty. The nation was beginning to enter a economic depression and the government was frantically trying to organizing trade deals with the more stable Brettonia. Many internal and external aggressors had begun to take advantage of situation for many different personal agenda's. Rowan Thompson, as a member of Brettonia's international task-force, it was his job to ensure such threats didn't interfere with Brettonian interest. Of course they frequently would as the attack on leeds had proved. Either way the political climate was heating up into a more volatile state</div>

<br />Rowan was considering the civil unrest in Liberty. They were on the brink of economic depression while those in the government sought trade deals with the Britonians. Many, from within and without sought to take advantage of the situations for their own purposes. Rowan Thompson's task, as a member of the International Task-Force, was to ensure the Britonian interests were secure. There were of course, frequent attacks that could sway the political climate, making the situation, volatile.
<br />
<br />
<br />Just some suggestions to make it easier to follow.
