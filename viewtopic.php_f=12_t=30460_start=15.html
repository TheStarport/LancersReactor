			<div class="content">@Loc I like the umbrella Idea completely non threatening until its too late for your attacker (here's hoping you never have to use it or use it again<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )  
<br />
<br />When I was younger and stupider I use to carry knives and such until one day I realized If I had them I could use them (I dont live in a dangerous place and havent for a long time)  But for those who do It can be a necessity Take locutus for example his choice of weapon is (by first glance and please forgive if I get this wrong LOC <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) is for defensive purposes only it is a &quot;stealth weapon&quot; one that does not look like a weapon but is in fact a dangerous and possibly deadly one in the right hands (I assume you have trained with it?) but no bravado is it carried with nor arrogance but as a tool to keep him out of danger there is nothing wrong with that.  Anyone who carries a weapon just to be kewl (like I did *see above will more than likely come to harm from it )
<br />
<br />and as to hybrid whip Kusarigama thing that sounds like bear to learn got a pic of it?
<br /> For a Supple weapon I use a Sjambok (simulated rolled hippo hide 36 inches in length kind of like a short stiff whip it is used to kill snakes in africa at least thats what the catalog said. I could never get the hang of whips I either thwacked me seld or didnt hit with enuf power
<br />
<br />@Recusant I agree that is a valid fear but in some cases those without means of defending themselves become prey or victims.  I am also a fairly big guy used to be a fairly accomplished martial artist but that wouldnt do against some one who has a gun for example..  I havent raised my hands in anger since well forever it seems but I have had to defend my self even when going out of my way to avoid confrontation.  some scum just see that as more weakness instead of the strength that it is.

<br />It is a hand scythe with chain and small counterweight attached.  Cannot figure out where the whip would fit in.  Does it replace the counterweight?  the chain?

			<h3><a href="#p273145" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Well its got no chain actually,
<br />I used some of my expertise to put a blade on the handle, like with the Kusarigama, the rest is like a multi flayle of Leather strips, like with the Cat o'nine tails.
<br />Only I banded the strips together until they formed three leather straps Stuck em and Ties them, They are now five times the original length and bound together in 3 strips with a Knot tied at the end as counter weight, I also used a longer stick (Twice the original Length but the same shape, namely a stick which slims to the end but with a firm knot there also) for the blade I used an old piece of cutlery, from which I removed the handgrip plates, and I sawed in the end of the stick until it fit, I then proceded to drill two holes, two in the handle stick and one in The Blade end. I put the blade in place put a bolt where the blade is Tightened it, and I put a Bolt in the top and tightened that so the blade was fixed.
<br />and voila, There is your Kusarigama Hybrid, I sharpened up the blade and had the cutting sides hardened. and put a cover over the blade as its as sharp as a Katana. It rests in a place where only I can reach it.
<br />
<br />As for the Technique with the umbrella, its very easy, you take a wooden Curtain rail and start practicing, make sure you have two, one of your own length plus four inches, and a two feet one, to practice your technique with the shorter umbrella stick.
<br />
<br />Talking about Katana's, You can make your own out of Wood, make sure you get a ROUND, HARDWOOD Stick of about a legs length, add 8-10 Inches to that and  and with a diameter of about 1,5 to two inches. You now have your final stick, Now Mark about 12-14 Inches from the end of your stick and make an outline, if you want the blade bended a bit, make a kind of a Libris and put weights on Both ends, wait a few days (Check each day until your &quot;custom-curve&quot; is reached) Now take out a Beltsander, and &quot;scrub&quot; the whole off until you have a flat stick of about a cm or 10/25th of an inch left, also make sure that you curve of the top of it. OK this is the final outline of your blade. Now you have two choices, do you want a practice sword (1) or a cutting sword&lt;&#178;&gt;
<br />
<br />(1)= The only thing you have to do is to round off the cutting side, so it has a slight resemblance of a cutting tool, also remember that when putting on the cutting side you leave a Block of 1,5 inches above the grip to get the Tsuba on (if wanted)
<br />
<br />&lt;&#178;&gt;= OK you have obviously chosen the hard part, actually the prep is the same as with (1), only this time you really sharpen the cutting edge, The only thing you have to do different is that you have to put on layers of iron plating, you have to slightly heat them up, and then &quot;wrap&quot; them around your blade.
<br />After you wrapped each layer, warm it up a bit more all over and let it cool, do this about three times, as the heat makes them more flexible, the cold hardens it, after this process is done you will first have to sharpen the &quot;blade&quot; into its final form, make it real razor edged and as sharp as possible, then the blade has to be hardened and sharpened by a professional, I would suggest some sort of Strong protective metal like Titanium or sth, make sure its just a tin sheet of it.
<br />
<br />The Tsuba, is made from wood. just cut out a block of about an inch thick and make it about 10 Centimetres/4 inches in Diametre, as rough cut out.
<br />then mark a rectangle hole the size of the bottom of the blade, make sure it fits about perfectly. Now its just the finishing touch on it make sure the Base is a BIT wider then when you measured, so when you press it on its stuck, what could also help things get fixed, is a little glue at the base so its really stuck.
<br />when its on you can give it a colour you like or sand it fine lacquor it, you name it. Just let it be done before the blade is hardened for the second time. 
<br />OK when the blade is hardened the second time, This tiem make sure that the blade is Covered in a little more covering then the first time and this time stand by it when its sharpened and make sure that the blade is made REALLY sharp this time, then you have completed fase one, now fase two, The polishing
<br />Make sure that you get a shining polish that goes well with the hardening metal, and polish it until it has a chrome shining.
<br />When polishing the Blade make sure that you WAX OUTWARD, in other words, Wax TO THE SHARP SIDE, to avoid being cut and losing a finger or cutting anything, when in Doubt of how to polish ask a professional to do it.
<br />
<br />Fase two and a half: This is merely a finishing touch on the handle, the handle should have a slight curve.
<br />OK now drill a hole the size of a plug in the bottom, do it slowly  so the end won't split. now make a stop with a Diametre of half an inch wider then the handle
<br />about 1,5 inch long, drill a hole in that as well and put a wooden plug in it, glue it stuck and let it dry. when its dry, you will have to start the strapping of the handle, I suggest you use Strips of Cotton Black in combination with glue. Glue the strips down on the handle then tie the strips around the handle in a curve like shape or whatever you see fit, I would suggest a curve, as it is easier to apply
<br />
<br />You now have made your own sword, Congratulations, to conclude with Fase three, this is basicly Practice until your sword reflects your own skill, and then Keep practicing, and Honour your sword,
<br />
<br />DISCLAIMER 1: These things are not to be Done without professional Help, nor for an adult as for a minor should do this alone, when even in the slightest Doubt call a pro, this goes explicitly for choice &lt;&#178;&gt; but a bit less for (1). but none the less goes for both.
<br />
<br />DISCLAIMER 2: I strongly recommend against any Minor even attempting to build such a sword (minor = under twenty to me) I therefore accept no responsibility for anyone building such a sword on his own, nor do I accept resonsibility for any injuries sustained during the process of building such a sword This includes Minors and adults alike.
<br />
<br />a little note besides, it is in any way unadvisable for a minor to do something like this before his growth has stopped, because if it hasn't your customisation will be off, the thing I described was based on the customisation formula I learned that was in turn based on the fact of being &quot;grown out&quot;
<br />
<br />Note: (Sorry about the Caps) THE DISCLAIMERS AIN'T THERE FOR THE PLEASURE, TAKE THEM TO HEART!!!

<br />Yes it is for defensive purposes only.
<br />Yes I have trained with it, but not extensively.
<br />and it can be deadly for any arrogant fool that thinks I carry around for fun, but by observing more of the stealth ways that are sometimes employed by the Ninpo and NinJitsu Artists, I have more tricks up my sleeve if necessary, as I can tighten my sleeves, and I wear arm padding at times, I can hide the knives up my sleeves.
<br />The Kusarigama-Hybrid is not to be used open in public as it tends to arouse suspicion too much. basicly anything that has a blade arouses too much suspicion.
<br />There is one thing wrong in your statement though, and that is the following:
<br />What we know as weapons is merely an extension of the true weapon, Our body.
<br />One that does not respect that is either dead man walking, or just a plain fool.
<br />A true Warrior knows that a &quot;weapon&quot; is only usefull when the &quot;tool&quot; and the &quot;master&quot; are in alignment. one must not see the blade as a plain tool made of steel, wood or otherwise, but more as an existence on its own.
<br />Arch was right about firearms. Firearms serve no purpose but technology, its all great, but if a bullet misses its actual target, what do you think happens?? In the worst case scenario you hit an innocent person, a living person of flesh and blood, that was standing by and looking, living its own life, that sorts of &quot;Violence&quot; is dishonourous. The Blade is more then just a tool its a life of its own, which carries the soul of his carrier and maker, To use a Blade right one must know his true self, and be prepared to accept himself as he is. Only then the warrior is Pure enough and worthy to face Battle and can Die in Honour if such is to happen, because to use a blade wrong is to commit common murder.
<br />The greater challenge lies in solving Quarrel without a weapon: <font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>&quot;You must learn to solve your problems without unsheething your sword&quot;   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>And there is in my mind nothing more true then that.
<br />
<br />@Taw, Loc knows only one weapon, Himself
<br />
<br />Edit: To get rid of unwanted rumours, I am not a practicioner of Neither Ninpo or Ninjitsu, I am merely an observer.

			<h3><a href="#p273179" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I take several martial arts classes, growing up and now. While this wont help me while im sleeping, if I awake somewhere in the middle of the night, I tend to stay completely still and silent. Its a good way to hear things out, I stay silent and still till I am able to see a bit more clearly in the dark (standard human nightvision) usually by looking around the area of faintly illuminated objects like my digital clock on the cable box and so forth. After I do get some kind of perception of the general area around me I try to avoid turning on the light till I realize the room is completely clear. Darkness is an advantage to both you and the person in your house, thus take advantage of it on your end. I have no traditional weapons in my hosue but my househould tends to have plenty of weapons that could be used if you improvise. Though weapons usually arent something I prefer.
<br />
<br />And yes, to answer the question I can get a bit paranoid too. Every now and then (rarely) I start to get a strange feeling of being watched and/or followed. And I live in a fairly big house that doesnt help it much. The previous owner killed his brother and buried him in the basement, which, not to say my house is haunted or anything. Has made strange occurences happen, generally each night the floor creaks as if someone was walking on it, though I have gotten used to that. I survived some trauma as a child and sometimes the only thing keeping me up is my very own conscience. Such as seeing things far away in the dark or having things appear in places. Im a grown man but now and again I get small episodes where I see things I generally dont, would prefer seeing. For example, almost a year ago, I was standing in my hallway and see this thing on the other end. I couldnt make out what it was but seemed to be walking by hunched over. I looked at it closer, and it seemed as if it noticed me, directly after that it seemed to have ran directly towards me. 
<br />
<br />After it &quot;collided&quot; i lost much of my balance and almost fell down the steps, in fact started falling if I hadnt grabbed the handle or whatever they call the thing that they have that you hold when going up steps. It was possibly the wierdest moment in my life, eyes seemed to just close themselves and I feel out of nowhere. So generally I really am fairly rational, this is augmented by the self defense classes I take but nonetheless. I believe its human nature every now and then to just get a onset of inexplicable paranoia. So yeah, I have those little fits and sleepless nights too.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sometimes I just stare at my computer screen and wonder what technology hath wrought. Other times I stare at it and think, those have GOT to be fake&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Well...it happens once in a while if i had a bad dream or sth that I am afraid at night, but luckily not often...and for the unforseen there are always my trusted hockey stick or a gholfclub altough at this stage it's not of much use cause the hs it on the other side of the room and the gc in the closet so I guess then a sream or two will have to do <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

If I saw something like that in my house and it started running towards me I'd probably try to escape as fast as I possibly could out the nearest exit, be it door or window. You know what they say, discretion is the better part of valour. But seriously though, did you move house after that?
