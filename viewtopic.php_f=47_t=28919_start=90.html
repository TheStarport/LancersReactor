			<div class="content">Captured Pt. 14: A Hope For the Future
<br />
<br />          The cockpit doors opened, and out stepped a fimalliar man. Juni ran up and hugged him immedatly. Trent coudln't think of anything to say, standing right in front of him, was a man who had saved their lives many times before. A man who was thought to be dead. It was King, standing right in front of them, embrasing Juni and smiling at Trent. &quot;Thought you  could use a lift, man, its good to see you guys again.&quot; King was now looking directly at Trent, but when King entered the shadows, Trent thought he could see a faint blue glow in his eyes. &quot;Trent, you all right?&quot; he said. &quot;Yeh, I just need to get some rest, you got a bed on this ship?&quot; King pointed to the waiting area, there were soft benches. &quot;Good enough.&quot; Trent walked in, the benches were just long enough to stretch out on. &quot;Make yourself confurtable. This trip could last about 48 hours, due to the Nomad total invasion on Sirius and all that. So there wont be any tradelanes, jumpgates, stuff like that.&quot; Trent, who had been fighting his courosity all along, finally asked,&quot;So King, how did you get away from the Nomads and end up in Alaska?&quot; King laughed, and told him that he would tell everyone when they got to their destination. Trent asked where they were going. &quot;A previously uncharted system, in the Edge Worlds. Omicron Delta, Faro Base.&quot; Trent laied down and closed his eyes, and for the first time in almost 24 hours, was asleep... Trent woke up several hours later, the room was dark, and he assumed King and Juni had also turned themselves in. He realized that he needed to use the restroom. He walked into the controle room, and to his surprise, King was still up. King greeted him, and Trent asked about the restroom. King laughed &quot;Well, this ship was built for long distance.&quot; He pointed down the cooridor, &quot;Second door on your left.&quot; Trent thanked him and went down the hall, where he found the door marked Restroom. Trent did his buisness and started to watch his hands, when out of the corner of his eye, there were three shadows. They were comming down the hall, with a blue glow to them. Four Nomads steped into the room, spotted him and opened fire. Blue lasers peirced his chest, he was flung back against the wall. Trent awoke in a cold sweat,had that only been a dream? It felt so real. Trent stood up and saw a clock, it was 8:17 am SST(Standard Sirius Time), Juni was still asleep. Trent no doubt felt strongly for her, but was it love? Trent walked into the controle room, where he could see the open door to the gally. King was making himself a cup of coffee, and some breakfast. King greeted him, &quot;So your awake, I was getting worried about you. I found you in the restroom lastnight, out cold on the floor.&quot; Trent was confused, he had thought it was nothing more than a dream. Trent got an uneasy feeling in his stomach, he put his hand on it. &quot;You OK Trent?&quot; &quot;Yeh, just a little hungary I guess. So what happened last night? Why was I on the restroom floor?&quot; King told him not to worry, he just passed out from exaustion. The next few days were uneventfull, but when the console beeped, Trent and Juni ran into the controle room. &quot;Well, here we are. Faro base, Omicron Delta.&quot; There were debrise everywhere, and a large base off in the distance, about 12K away. The ship (named the Arcangel) docked at the new base, and shut down. Trent, King, and Juni stepped out of the small ship, and viewed the massive docking bay. Kress stepped out of the equipment deeler's area and walked over to them. &quot;I never got a chance to tell you that King mannaged to end up with us. Is everyone alright?&quot; Kress asked. After a brief converstation, everyone steped into another room. A new group similar to the Order had been formed. Many of the members had followed Enrique from El Signian space. They were called La Dieablos Negros(The Black Devils), and they were all of the resistance that remained. Kress told them that only 18.73% of the Human populaiton was still alive, and it was dropping almost 1% daily. &quot;Trent, we need you and all of your friends for a mission that could stop the Nomad threat. This mission will be extremly dangrous, because your ships won't be able to use shields. And your going to the most dangrous place known to man.&quot;

<br />
<br />
<br />  &quot;Trent, we need you and all of your friends for a mission that could stop the Nomad threat for good. You will be going into the most dangrous place known to man.&quot; Trent was getting sick and tired of always being ordered around, of always being someone's servant. Now Trent was getting a little adgetated, &quot;Kress, I think you might want to find someone elce.&quot; Kress was starteled by this, he replied &quot;Trent, I know you feel very strongly about Jun'ko, would you willingly let an advanced alien race kill her?&quot; Trent was beaten, and he knew it. &quot;Alright, I'll do it. What kind of place?&quot; Kress asked Trent to follow him into the brefing room. He motioned everyone elce to come along as well. As everyone found a seat, Kress walked up onto the stage. &quot;The Nomads have found a way to detect cloaked ships, whitch is the main reason why this mission will be so dangrous. We have two state-of -the-art ships, the Freedom, and the Independence, these will be the ships to take you to the Nomad power core.&quot; Trent raised his hand and said &quot;Did you say Nomad power core?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did. This power core is the place where the Nomads and the Dom Kavish get the power for their ships from. How this power is sent over millions of lightyears is still unknown, but we need you to destroy it. Now, there is another thing that makes this mission extremly dangrous, your ships won't be able to use shields of any kind. With a cloak, the Nomads will pick you up, and with shields, they will pick up the enegry signiture. So, your flying unprotected, the only way they will be able to find you is vissualy, and asteroid scanners. Both ships will launch at 6:30 PM SST, and find the expermintal hyperdrive engiens floating around in outer space in this system. The engiens have tracking devices in them, so finding them won't be a problem, after you have the engiens locked onto your ship, you will activate them. For the first 2 minutes of the flight, you will be at 26Gs, so you will activate your presurised suits, to keep strain down to about 11Gs. Then there will be no gravity at all. Now, 67 hours later, you will dock with Kona Shipyard at the halfway mark from here to the Nomad power core. Your hyperdrive engeins will be recharged. Then you'll release, and take a 60 hour trip toards the Nomad powe core. Now, we only have one shot at landing on this core descuised as a planet, and that's exactly when a large asteroid, the size of Maine, passes it. Our scanners indacate that there will be a large tunnel that runs all the way through the asteroid, you'll dump your hyperdrive engeins there, and thats how you will approach the planet undetected. You will land on the power core, and use the laser drill, in order to get the bomb down far enough to cause a core meltdown, you will have to drill to 80,000 feet. This normally could be done in about 15 minutes, but due to the consistancy of the shell, it will take alot longer. Once you land, you will have 87 minutes to get the job done. Why the strict time limit you ask? There willl be a Nomad fleet heading to the core for rutien matanice, they leave as soon as you land. With their speed technology, it will only take them 87 minutes to get there. Once you finish drilling the hole, you will send down a quantum-antimatter hybrid bomb, take off, dock with your hyperdrive engiens, get a save distance and detonate. Thats it, if this core is taken out, the Nomad ships will only be able to last for about 30 minutes bofore they shut down for good. And that's all there is to it.&quot; Kress walked off of the stage, and up to Trent. &quot;I think you might need to find nine other people for this mission.&quot; Two days passed and Trent had found the people he needed, Juni had wanted to come, but Trent told her it was too dangrous. She protested and woudln't take NO for an answer. Launch day came, as the Freedom and Independence were loaded into the docking bay, the crew steped into their assigned ships. On the Freedom were, Order pilot Watts, LSF Col. Sharp, King, Juni, a man from the matance crew Chick Chappele, &quot;Rockhound&quot;, and King's friend from the LSF Max. On Independence were Order pilot Tucker, LSF Col. Davis, Trent, and four other volunters, Freddie Newninn, Oscher Choice, Jaotis Baire, and Raoule Sanchez. Both ships were ready for launch, the engens roared to life. The ships lifted off the floor, and moved into the chamber. The airlock secured and both the Freedom and Independence were now in outer space. They found the hyperdrive engens and locked on, they roard to life. A transmission came over the radio &quot;Freedom, your are cleared for hyperspace, in 10, 9, 8&quot; The countdown was completed and the Freedom was lost from sight. &quot;We have go for Independence, 3, 2, 1&quot; Trent was sucked into the back of his chair. The nembule vanished from sight. They were now on their way, the fate of the entire human race was focused on those fourteen brave souls, traveling into the unknown.....

<br />
<br />   The hyperdrive engiens came online, thrusting Trent back in his chair. Col. Davis, over the COM channel, &quot;Freedom, this is a kick-ass ride!&quot; Both the Freedom and Independence began the three day trip to Kona Shipyard. The nembule of Omicron Delta was no longer in sight, and there seemed to be less Gs than before. Trent coudln't tell if the Gs had gone down, or if he had just gotten used to it. After about 30 seconds, there was no gravity at all, everything that was not nailed down to the floor started floating. Three days later....  &quot;Roger Freedom, we have visual on Kona Shipyard. Activating docking sequience. Kona Shipyard, this is shuttle Independence, we need clearance to dock.&quot; There was a long pause, then &quot;Shuttles Freedom and Independence, you are both authouized to dock, Freedom port one, Independence, port two.&quot; Both ships landed withought a hitch, when they were all onboard, the crew of Kona approached them. &quot;Hands up now!&quot; One man said pulling out a gun. They all did as they were told, exept for Freddie. The man's eyes started to glow blue, and everyone knew he was infested with a Nomad. &quot;Hands up now!&quot; the man repeted, pointing the gun at Freddie. Freddie dived off behind a crate, before the man had a chance to fire, Trent was all over him. Trent was kicked in the face a few times before he finally wrestled the man's gun away from him. Trent pointed it at the man's face, and he stopped struggling. &quot;Now, I want you to put your hands up.&quot; Trent commanded, the man did as he was told. He pulled out a small silver object from his pocket. He laughed, and pressed a button on it. The station shook violantly, and the man laughed again. &quot;Now, they know where this base is, and they will hunt you down and crush you!&quot; He pressed another button, and a computerized voice said &quot;Warning, self distruct sequience activated. Distruction in five minutes.&quot; Trent pointed the gun at the man, put it right up to his face, and fired. The man went down immedatly, and a puddle of blood filled the floor. The engiens were recharged, and the crew ran toards the ships. Out of the window, Juni noticed two Nomad Battleships, and several fighters. The battleships torpiedod the base, and the bridge was blown off, and floating into space. Another wave of topiedos hit the station, a peice of metal came falling from the cealing and hit Freddie in the head. Everyone made it to the ships, as another wave of torpiedos hit the station. The ships released andbegan moving away from the dying station. Three more torpiedos hit the shipyard, and it exploded. Debriese went everywhere, and some hit the shuttle Freedom, but not enough to dammage it. They hit hyperdrive and sped away from the station, and the Nomads. &quot;Freedom, the remaining Independence crew is on board and accounted for. Were even heavy with Jun'ko Zane.&quot; The shuttle Freedom had put Freddie in a staysis pod, to keep him alive untill they could get medecal help. The Freedom and the Independence finally arrived near the power core, wher they saw the asteroid that was supposed to give them cover untill they got to the planet. The hyperdirve engiens were droped, and the ships headed for the asteroid. There was alot of debrise, but these pilots were expert pilots. They were bairly missing large peices of rock, that came dangrously close to their ship. &quot;Were hit! Independence this is Freedom, we have lost controle and are going down.&quot; Watts and Sharp said into the radio. Watts turned around, &quot;Everyone, go to your own life-support. Lock yourself in the cargo bay. Independence mayday. We are going down.&quot; King and one two other people made it into the cargo bay as a web of cracks appered on the front window. &quot;Oh my God, this is it.&quot; Sharp said. The Freedom slamed into a large peice of rock, where the front window shattered. Sharp and Watts were sucked out of the ship, into the hard vaccum of space. Watts' body slammed up against the front window of the Independence, and skimmed the roof. The Freedom began to fall toards the main part of the asteroid, where it exploded. The Freedom was gone.........
