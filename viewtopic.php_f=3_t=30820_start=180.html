			<div class="content">but digitall anvil or microsoft announced about freelancer 2?
<br />
<br />i dont want start a new thread for other little questions, so i post here
<br />
<br />I saw in server list for freelancer some new versions (i think 5 other versions, made by users??), usually all servers are for first version, with no updates. Well what is with this new versions? (if we install them cant play anymore in best server with first version...)
<br />
<br />Other problem how these servers work, if someone know? A &quot;private person&quot; &quot;sacrifice&quot; his computer 24/7, that is fantastic... anyway we want know more interesant things and secrets about Freelancer servers and people who host them and what they do. At last this is first problem in freelancer because without them we cant play...
<br />
<br />Btw this list <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.flserver.com/topservers.htm">http://www.flserver.com/topservers.htm</a><!-- m --> who i think is from this site (lancersreactor.com) is little wrong, Eagle utopia have place 19 and he is first or anyway no 19, after GetOnIt Server who have usually 5 players online and eagle 40... is a cool list like this forum too but dont confused us)

			<div class="content">I've been thinking, for &quot;Freelancer 2,&quot; I'd like to see changes made to the Bounty Hunters Guild faction. It would be interesting if they were also hired by criminals as well. It'd be kinda neat for them to be neutral to everybody like the Zoners but get paid to work for whomever they choose.
<br />
<br />Another thing that'd be cool is to see the Corsairs and Red Hessians to get their act together in Omega 5 and possibly form an alliance with each other. Same should be made possible with the Corsairs and the Outcasts.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, Leeds shoud be a clean system for the sequel because, currently, it's disgusting to look at. And BMM and Bowex should be destroyed by the Mollys, because I can't stand those crooked snobs.
<br />
<br />Also, it's always been a pet peeve of mine how there are no Corsairs in either Leeds or Tau-31 but they're somehow spotted in Edinburgh when there's no Jump Hole connection from there to New London, Dublin, or Cambridge. Fix this problem.
<br />
<br />And the Junkers should defeat the Hogosha, leaving them free to roam Kusari space, allowing the Blood Dragons and the Golden Chrysanthemums a closer depot for supplies and commodities.
<br />
<br />The psychotic Xenos should be spreading out more and more throughout the Colonies beyond their presence in Liberty and the Independent Worlds, as their numbers will probably be bigger and their pilots more proficient for stealing cargo and taking in the money.
<br />
<br />The Lane Hackers would acquire the Jump Gate and Trade Lane technology from Ageria and distribute the codes to the rest of the Houses, criminals and corporations alike, thus putting Ageria out of business.
<br />
<br />The war-torn Rheinland would not be war-torn anymore, as the LWB would force the blasted Synth Foods back into Liberty and take back Planet Stuttgart, making Rheinland the new food market throughout the colonies, which would improve their economy, putting Synth out of business. Rheinland would also build the Battleship Deutschland, which will reside in New Berlin, Battleship Braunschweig in Frankfurt, and Battleship Koln in Dresden.
<br />
<br />Ultimately, for the sequel, the arrogant hot-heads of Liberty will be the ones in economic trouble, as after they are proved useless to others, they will be left out of the competition.

			<div class="content">Well, i have read most of the responses to this forum and i have tried to sum them up and add in my ideas.  Some of these are from other games too.
<br />
<br />A lot of people want to change major things like docking rings and add more aliens, but that would totally change the game.  If you really wanted something like that it would be better to make a new game.  It would me much easier then incorperating it into Freelancer 2.
<br />
<br />One thing i would like is to be able to choose whether or not to play the missions or not.  Such as in single player and in multiplayer.  I do like the idea of a destructible universe and the idea of more realistic sizes for the whole universe.  If you want to become political, you can like.  You can just go around and kill people but if you get some money and then buy some people to help you.  Then you can buy a space station and stock it up.  But the thing is you have to hire people to work in it like a bartender and a trader.  You also need scientists to advance your weapons. Rise of Nations has a good way of using scientist to gain points which you can use to advance the weapons at your base.  You can buy weapon platform and place them around the system to protect yourself and your people. Also you can start you own fraction and with lots of time take over as much as you want to.  But that would take time and lots of battles.  You also need to keep down savatures and other revolutionaries if you are too hostile.  Also like the political structure of Civ III.  You cannot buy a battleship from another nations unless you become powerful enough, but you can build your own but you need lots of workers and scientists.  To make money you can have tax the people and to encourage people to come you need to start up a trade and also mine things.  Also you need to get companies to start trading with you and other things.  Custom ships for your base would be fun to make.  Also you can make trade lanes and Jump gates to other systems that you control.  But if you make major colonies hate you they can send fleets to attack and you have to have whole navies to defend yourself.  If  they win they would take away most of your stuff or maybe put restriction on trade and ships.  Also, maybe if you become strong enough be recognized as your own country.
<br />
<br />Also planets with multiple bases on it which you can choose to land on.  Also a changing prices in the universe and if you sell more things the price goes down.  A moveable universe were the planets move around the sun but your nav map can track them for you so not to make it too hard to move around.
<br />
<br />Or you can buy a company and start to build it up from the ground and become major power of the economy.  You can control trade roots and fix prices.  If the government tries to stop you, you can pay them off.  You can set up waypoints for your trains to follow and have your own logo.
<br />
<br />Some people might thing this too radical and some things probably are for a FPS but this would be a great game.  If even if not for Freelancer 2 it would still be a lancer and would be really fun.  This would bring together what I consider the best of a few games and would be really fun to play.</div>

			<div class="content">There was a mod which were going to incorporate the ability to buy, maintain and destroy stations, as well as making profit out of mining stations and gas miners.
<br />
<br />Custom ships and weapons was also allowed to a certain extent.
<br />
<br />The problem is that this mod, Freelancer: Exodus, have seem to died.
<br />
<br />Now you ask: &quot;How can i be able to buy bases?&quot;
<br />As you are now reading a post by a general PHP-nerd, you do the maths. Everything would be maintained by a website, linked to a database. The database would then update the universe when a player buys a base, and then withdraw money from the neural net account of the player and place the station in it's location.
<br />
<br />So, there have indeed been such mods that could classify as a sequel to Freelancer <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />On other hand, if you want to join the mod and maybe help pull this project through (as it looks now, it won't even become a beta) send an email to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:freelancer_fan@hotmail.com">freelancer_fan@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->.

			<div class="content">I've just read this whole thread and I can't beleive only one person mentioned this, and then only in passing. (a couple of others hinted at it) NEWTONIAN PHYSICS.  
<br />
<br />This allows you to increase the scale of a system (ie bigger planets and stations, not to mention larger distances between them) without taking forever to travel between them.  Simply point yourself to your goal and kick in the thrusters.  If you keep them going you'll just keep getting faster and faster.  (Fuel/power starts becoming an issue but only if the game incorporates it - personally I think it should)  Oh, and it would be highly recommended to start decellerating when you're half-way there, else you may find yourself approaching a planet at a million miles an hour (maybe literally) without enough time to stop - OUCH!  All too complictaed?  Don't want to expend all that brainpower calculating when to accelerate/decelerate?  Well, that highly sophisticated auto pilot you paid all that money for could help.    
<br />
<br />Futhermore it would add dramatic tatical and strategic choices to combat.  eg. a light fighter, whilst not able to deliver the firepower of a heavier craft, would easily be able to out manoeuvre them. (assuming of course they had similarly rated thusters)   Be careful though, with newtonian physics and some pretty fancy flying, there's nothing stopping that heavy fighter swivelling around, whilst still heading away from you, to pummel you with those heavier weapons.
<br />
<br />I could go on all day about the benefits (and drawbacks - yes, I acknowledge there are some) of incorporating newtonian physics into a space sim, but this isn't the place.  Maybe I'll start a thread somewhere else on this site (if no-one else has) to discuss it further.  Suffice to say I think it's the one thing that should be in FL2.</div>

			<div class="content">I definitely agree with most ideas,  like having a dynamic economy,  more stuff to do on bases like casinos and more varied missions. 
<br />
<br />I'd like some persistent/mmo world-style add-ons: 
<br />
<br />The ability to HIRE NPC escorts/bodyguards/gang members. 
<br />By the same token,  it would be really cool to be able to purchase/contract to build bases and/or hangars.  You could take it a step further by being able to hire people for missions,  long-term contracts and to have volunteers approach you based on your reputation (ie if you are popular,  you get volunteers showing up at your space station base wanting a piece of the action.  You could assign them duties like patrolling your space,  joining your personal squadron,  mining a specific area,  trading specific goods or roaming and attacking hostiles,  etc.  You could take it a step further by giving your group a name and becoming a dynamic faction within the game.  On the flip side,  amassing a small army and building a base will give hostile NPCs something to aim at.  You could even make the missions dynamic so that other players can be offered Freelance missions to attack your base and your faction.  Other factions who do hat you do would consider you competition.  If your faction mines,  the other mining factions would be your competitors.  If you trade consumer goods and/or electronics,  other merchants would consider you competition.  If you collect bounties,  the bounty hunters consider you competition,  etc.  And likewise,  factions would support you depending on your stance.
<br />
<br />A reputation system that takes fame/reknown into consideration with a visible stat to let you know how important you are in the game world. 
<br />
<br />The ability to join NPC factions.  Not just be friendly/allied,  but actually a paid member of a certain faction. 
<br />
<br />Some &quot;shady&quot; hangouts in &quot;non-shady&quot; territory.  For example,  you're smuggling Cardamine into Manhattan and New London pretty regularly.  It would be cool to have a separate bar for &quot;lower class&quot; citizens such as yourself to make contacts and meet people,  while respectables would likely hang out at the other bar. 
<br />
<br />It would also be cool if there were varied wrecks,  like 1000 possible locations with about 100 of them active in the game at any one time.  Or maybe something bigger.</div>

			<div class="content">My ideas for freelancer 2 is more focus on a third person shooter. Or the ability to control your ship using a JOYSTICK with semi newton phsyics on top of it. Oh man will that will replace Jumpgate in a jiffy.
<br />
<br />As for hiring NPC wingman/bodyguard/whatever wither a player in a mmo would niglect the part of a massivly online universe. In multiplayer, you interact with players and and have them as your wingman.</div>

			<div class="content">I don't think the Junkers will have beaten the Hogosha. I think, rather, the Dragons and GC will have been pressured by the construction of the Chugoku Gate to thwack them. Kabukicho would be an easy target.
<br />
<br />In the midst of a Corsair invasion of the Sigma-systems (see &quot;Road to Rheinland&quot; newsboxes on Corsair bases), the GMG and Outcasts will be forced to ally with one another. The GMG is by now almost a House in its own right with the colonization of the remote Planet Koryo.
<br />
<br />The Corsairs basically end up taking on most of Kusari and Rheinland (plus Outcasts and GMG) all by their lonesome. Despite their skills, they can't deal with that level of resistance all at once.
<br />
<br />
<br />Lessee. Other stuff.
<br />
<br />* More systems to explore, of course.
<br />* Side-missions
<br />    - Farmers' Guild string -- Alliance and LWB working together to ruin Synth Foods
<br />    - Corsair/Kusari War
<br />    - Maybe it's just me having played too much Freespace 2, but having Omega-11 go supernova would be fun to try to outrun.
<br />* Be able to significantly change systems through your actions (maybe this could be controlled manually by the server in multi).
<br />* Add clan bases dynamically, server-side, and have their construction levels be based on the level of supplies brought in for em. So, say the (FLAN) Clan is building Custard Base or summin. They'd need to bring in a lot of supplies to keep it running; their supplies would be there, and they couldn't repair their ships after a fight unless they had enough Hull Panels. And food and water and oxygen would be issues, too, those would be constantly consumed. Improving the base would take time and effort (and lots of money) but having the base be able to make its own food would be a very good thing. Good logistics should be a virtue. (Twould also encourage clans to work together for the sake of unified bases.)
<br />* Mining things from roid belts should go faster when you're mining things of low value. Diamonds and Niobium are fine at one per rock. More effort for more expensive things. But things like Ice and Hydrocarbons should be 3 or 4 so that you don't spend hours mining for crap. (I think that can be done anyhow. But eh, should be the default.)
<br />* When you're on a planet, you should be able to hire NPCs, either to escort you or to haul stuff around for you. Hire a train to haul those Ship Hull Panels to Custard Base! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />* Hence, the command screen. You'd need to tell your NPCs to HOLD POSITION or to GO HERE (points to map) and such.
<br />* Escort Missions -- escort Trains and Convoys and such from (PLACE_A) to (PLACE_<img src=smilies/icon_smile_blackeye.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>, guarding them from (ENEMY_A). Or, if you're into the devious end of things, escort smugglers from A to B, and keep police away from them or summin.
<br />* Cargo Run missions -- I still can't believe these weren't in FL to begin with. Liberty asks you to run some Prisoners to Texas (if they trust you and the pirates don't -- a few simple Faction Value less-than checks). Or say the Blood Dragons want you to go to Ainu to pick up Water and Food and then come back. Mundane stuff like that.
<br />* Change your own avatar, then see not only yourself but the other Freelancers walking around the bar. On that note, you should be able to design new uniforms for your clan, too.
<br />* Less cross-referencing with regard to IDs and such. Keep it unified for easier modding. Like, in the system INI, it'd say Base, Location, Orientation, Name, Description. Not just links to a file with preset ones (an archaic and convoluted way of doing it IMO) but it'd have that actual string info itself attached to the file.
<br />
<br />Then again, hoping for Microsoft to ever make modding easy in their games is like a Zimbabwe election: you keep hoping that good sense might finally prevail, but you know damn well it won't. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
