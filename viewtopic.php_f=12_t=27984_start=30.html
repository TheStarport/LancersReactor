			<div class="content">@Taw, I clarified a few directions in the recipe with bold type.  Also feel free to change the order around of how you do things.  I've actually seared the potatoes with the meat and juices at one point, but the way the recipe is written works best for taste in my opinion.
<br />
<br />As for those potatoes you mentioned, I have no idea what those are like.  All I can say is stay away from the brown potatoes and stick to the lighter colours.  I never tried red potatoes, but they seem like they would be too strong for the meal.  The point is you don't want a potato that is too overpowering over the meal.
<br />

			<div class="content">The Sunday roast is not dead.  But in many households in the US, it borders on the somnolescent.  I'd have to admit that the Sunday roast in my house is for special Sunday occasions.  But I can do a good roast.  Last go round it was a nice rib eye round roast.  Un-traditionally, however, I use a convection oven which generally shaves about  3 to 5 minutes per pound off the total cooking time.
<br />
<br />And, there are many homes in New England where the said Sunday supper is sacrosanct.
<br />
<br />@Taw... What the heck is an oven setting of &quot;5&quot; in degrees, (preferably fahrenheit)?
<br />
<br />@WLB and Fd.  I love okra too.  I learned how properly to make black roux and I do a pretty good shrimp and andouille gumbo if I say so myself.

			<div class="content">General oven work.  What a laugh!  So I guess that gas mark &quot;5&quot; (almost sounds like a Vonnegut story <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) is somewhere in the 375 to 425 degrees range?
<br />
<br />BTW Taw, you should seek out and try yukon golds.  The meat is somewhat yellow in color and the hue tends to hint at the possible flavor.  They are shaped more like red potatos and usually are sized like new potatos or somewhat larger new potatos.  They have a hint of sweetness to it and are somewhat starchy, not quite as starchy as a regular red potato.  
<br />
<br />A real sweet potato has a more densely yellow meat and usually purplish skin so it is NOT a sweet potato either in appearance or in actual flavor.   Nor in shape.</div>
