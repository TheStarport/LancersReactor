			<div class="content">Nicely done site Firestorm. About us supporting piracy, we will tolerate mild piracy, but we will not allow players to excessively kill players in our space. We also to not allow n00b killing, dock camping or killing player controlled freighters if you have a higher lvl ship.
<br />
<br />To clarify, we do not mind a Drake picking on frieghters as long as it doesnt become excessive. We will no tolerate n00b killing unless the attacking player is in a low lvl ship. (Starflier vs an ealge isnt fair ppl, and it wont be tolerated) People who hunt down ever single player they can find and shoot them repeatedly will be hunted down and killed.
<br />
<br />Also, If you are attacked by pirates (player or NPC) in the Rheinland sector, contact a member of our clan to get our assistance.</div>

			<div class="content">Firestorm, did you even read bits posting about GOV no longer being a clan?  Bits said it was originally started to be a small group of people who were cool with each other and would try to make the server a decent place for noobs and themselves.  It's gotten to the point where that is no longer the case.  Therefore, GOV is no longer a clan but rather an ideal.  Just a group of people who have similar feeling about browclops.  As bits mentioned, the things he would like to stop are noob killing and freighter punking, among other things.  He doesn't want to claim territory or tax people.  If he wants money, he can earn it on his own.  He'll tell you the same thing.  And as far as &quot;your&quot; territory, didn't you say you had a whole 2 members?  Well, what happens if I come up with 2 of my buddies.  Your &quot;clan&quot; is suddenly outnumbered.</div>

			<div class="content">Freak, I respect you man, but I think you are wrong, and I think that Bits is a little deluded.  I have friends too, and I could call them in and we could all duke it out for the sake of duking it out.  That is the beauty of playing online, in a multiplayer setting - the end results/possibilities are endless.  When a group of people, whether they call themselves a clan, a society, a monkey harem, whatever - gets together and identifies itself separately from everyone else, they become a &quot;power&quot;.  What they do with it is up to them.  What is to stop someone from creating a character named [GOVXXXXX and then going around bouncing noobs?  Nothing.  That was the whole idea of the clans creating certain &quot;laws&quot; to keep everyone in checks and balances.  My understanding was that you had to be invited into [GOV...or anyone who played could make the name...right?  By the way, I went back and re-read the entire thread.  If GOV is not a clan (no longer a clan, whatever), does that mean there will be no more players with the GOV tag on their names and current GOV members are disbanding with only [GOVBits to remain?
<br />
<br />Bits - I emailed Brow, and asked if he minded the creation of something like this.  His response was &quot;Re: the clan thing, knock yourself out. All things being equal, I enjoy a bit of upheaval <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Browclops&quot;  I have the email still and will gladly send it to you, or you can ask Brow himself.   He asked that it was kept reasonable and that server rules were not violated.  By that endorsement from Brow, the same you claim to have, I am the law too.  I just was choosing to limit myself and anyone who wanted to play with me by my rules (initially) to Kusari.  It evolved from their...from a smartass comment to make light of Regulator and DocFugly's goings on about taxation.  It quickly evolved from there into something bigger and better.
<br />
<br />If I wanted to punk freighters, that's my business.  If I wanted to bounce noobs, that's my business.  If I wanted to give away creds and help people that is my business.  Whatever actions I decide to take is my business, but with each choice comes the responsibility of accepting the consequences of my actions.  I will deal with the consequences of my actions as they come.  Remeber, the name of the game, as BlitzRaven so generously and correctly put it, is FREELANCER.  I will do what I want, where I want, how I want, when I want, to anyone I want to do it to, as long as i don't violate the rules BROW - not you - has set.  You can try to stop me at the business end of a weapons load if you want - it's all part-and-parcel of the game amigo!
<br />
<br />This just stopped being fun for me, thanks to you.  All I, Regulator, Falcon, and the AR rep wanted to do is make it more fun for anyone and everyone.  You, individually, seem bent on closing something down before it even gets started.  I do not ever recall seeing you in the server, but you claim to be the leader of the group/clan/GOV assembled people?  How can you lead something you refuse to participate in?  You wanna have fun or have a pissing contest?  Sounds like you are interested in a pissing contest to me, so just stay out of my way.  If Brow wants to make you police - that's his business.  I will do what I want, where I want, how I want, when I want, to anyone I want to do it to, as long as i don't violate the rules BROW - not you - has set.
<br />
<br />I had someone ask me to keep an eye out for a player that had been stlking him and PKing him for no known reason.  I got a cool conversation and agreement from him BECAUSE of the clans issues going on.  Take the idea you had, multiply it a hundred-fold, and that might be the tip of the iceberg of what could have been.  You could have had several people working with you, instead you may find yourself standing alone.  Who knows?  I speak for me, and me alone.
<br />
<br />What could have been is posted on <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/clan_hre">http://www.freewebs.com/clan_hre</a><!-- m -->.

<br />
<br />From my point of view, Bitterman and I both wanted to start a clan.  I figured why not start it with him as a partner.  I didn&#8217;t even know TC101 existed.  I believe that I am an equal partner in the [GOV if not number 1, since I equally started a clan with Bitterman.  I created the [GOV tag and I created the name &#8220;United Systems of Browclops&#8221;.  I also created the fundamental ideas of a United Systems.  The rules that I proposed earlier in this forum were ideas that were not instituted ever by [GOV.  [GOV has no laws except the ones created in the clan councils, which are primarily inter-clan agreements and do not pertain to any other non-member players.  Therefore you are not canceling any &#8220;policies set forth by Reg&#8221;, since I did not institute any.  The Laws that I proposed were to be voted on before instituted.  Much of the hostility found is do to a lack of understanding about what I am trying to do.  Bitterman does not even understand it mostly due to our lack of communication caused by his absence.  Also, I believe that Bitterman is not truly free to role-play due to his policing mentality and duties.

<br />  Bitterman, if your goal was to create a clan of just friends, then why did you accept the name &#8220;The Federal Government of the United Systems of Browclops.&#8221; USB as an abbreviation.  Our ideas are completely different regarding the purpose of [GOV.  Mine is role-play.  Yours is server police.  Since I created the name and tag, I claim ownership to those items and thus remain in power of [GOV.  Please create a separate clan that is devoted to server police ideals and use them to role-play if you would like.  Take all of your loyal members with you.  You cannot create your following server rules, since the only server rule is to keep things reasonable.  The United Systems is devoted to following that rule, without breaking or bending it at all.  The [GOV will remain devoted to role-playing ideals.
<br />  You are creating a dictatorship.  Imposing your laws such as
<br />these things will get a member KICKED from GOV
<br />taxing
<br />pking n00bs
<br />pking freighters or backshooting EXCESSIVELY despite warnings
<br />not following rules, not being upstanding in events
<br />STARTING WARS
<br />cheating ANYONE, GOV member or not, out of their stuff in a xfer, etc.
<br />      These rules are your own server police mentality rules and will not be imposed upon  [GOV.  The laws of [GOV have not been created and will be created by clan meetings, which none to my knowledge have taken place and they will not contain your server police ideals unless voted in and these voted in laws will only pertain to the Liberty System.  I do not disagree with all of your previous laws, but they may or may not fit in the [GOV
<br />
<br />You are attempting to change [GOV into a dictatorship.  Please create your own dictatorship outside of [GOV.
<br />
<br />Quoting Bitterman &#8220;i built GOV on the concept of freedom,&#8221;
<br />---
<br />I contest this claim.  I built [GOV while you were doing missions or away from the game.  You just recruited your friends not understanding the theme of the government name and therefore neither do your recruits.
<br />
<br />You  claim that &#8220;[GOV will begin to go back to the foundations&#8221; that you have outlined. It will not and those are server police type ideals.  It will remain a lawless clan until laws can be voted on by clan members.  The Union entity and boundaries that have been set by the Union will remain.
<br />[GOV has claimed the NY system and Manhattan as its capital.  Members that accept these ideas may remain by expressing to me that they wish to remain.  Members that told Bitterman that he needs to get things under control are asked to leave the clan and reapply when they understand what is going on, which will probably not be until it is finished and builds a reputation that is not built off of the fear of the unknown, but from the observations of the players.  People that are against the way [GOV is developing do not understand anything about it.  [GOV is exactly the same as HRE SD and AR as they are represented on Browclops server, but with less laws created then the those clans.  Players that are against the Union of Clans are correct when they say they are against [GOV and the role playing concept that has been created.
<br />
<br />To help others understand better what the United Systems is about.
<br />
<br />When I started designing [GOV I was thinking of [GOV as being the United Systems, which has jurisdiction over all.  And, that each [GOV member was a federal agent that could be elected as governor of a system by [GOV members. [GOV would  also represent the freelancer players by listening to there opinions and bringing them to the clan meetings.  We were going to hold elections for [GOV members to be governors of different parts to the serius sector and elect a president of [GOV or United Systems.
<br />  Now that other clans have stepped up to help create state/nations governments, things have changed quite a bit.  This is much more interesting and less need to work hard to role play within our own members, because it is more real to have multiple clans than pretending we are governors of states within one clan.  Now we have to negotiate with clans of other nations.  It is really cool.
<br />
<br />Quoting you:  &#8220;we will no longer be identified as a clan. we no longer have a seat in the council related to territory&#8221; 
<br />
<br />You are wrong about this.  [GOV will remain the way it is and claim the territory of the Liberty System.  If you do not like that, then please create your playeritarian/humanitarian clan.  You should want to do this anyway to strip yourself of the negative stigma that you feel the [GOV tag has obtained.  The goal of the territories is to use role-play to &#8220;HAVE SOME FUN&#8221;.  If any freelancer wants to have territory they can join a Nation or create there own clan, but we do not guarantee that you will be recognized by the United Systems, as all territories have been claimed.
<br />
<br />  Bitterman.  Your threats to have people banned are getting out of hand.  You cannot have a person banned for not fitting to you ideals or representing the [GOV the way you see fit.  You may kick someone out of your clan, but you can&#8217;t have them banned for not role-playing the way you want.  However I do agree with you in your suggestion that Freelancer 7 should be banned and I back you in that.  His cursing was absolutely ridiculous.  He was bad enough that I had to yell at him.  That was an extreme case and was not reasonable behavior.  I back you on that decision, but I am not sure that I would trust you with admin abilities.  Heck you would probably ban me for disagreeing with you about the role of the [GOV.  I think that your abilities as a server police are adequate as they are.  An email to Browclops is as much abilities as you need.  Let Browclops decide what is reasonable and who gets banned.
<br />
<br />  Do not feel that I am kicking you out of [GOV.  I am merely requesting that you change your clan name.  I will recruit for my own clan, while maintaining the name that I have chosen.  Therefore all members are nolonger a member in the [GOV until they request to remain.  Consider this a break in our partnership, but not our friendship.  I created the name and it fits to my role-playing ideas with the other Union clans.  I will say again that [GOV has no laws and no taxes.  [GOV will be a democratic government of Liberty and will remain reasonable.  [GOV will not have any server police powers such as banning members for not representing correctly.  Read my previous post on this subject about the admin abilities of [GOV and how they do not and never will exist.  
<br />
<br />  One more thing I want to emphasize is that we may create mock WARS for role-playing.  If you will not tolerate that then bring it to Browclops.  They will be kept to a reasonable level and may even have pre-chosen battlefields in order to keep from irritating other players that may object.  This is every ones playground and we will try to respect that, so respect our rights role-play as well.  We have the right to pretend to hold a system under our control and create civil wars.
