			<div class="content">go away Americans. Rainbow is almost akin to a national institution, although I was a little old for it in it's heyday; but I fondly remember the adult innuendo that used to creep in from time to time. I recall one in famous incident when the cameras were left rolling after the final credits had gone by, when Bungle (played by Roy Skelton) tried to remove his head, and excalimed &quot;Christ, it's f***ing hot in here!&quot; My how we roared with laughter! On another occasion, Bungle, Zippy, and George were all in bed, having had to give up their separate beds for their guest Molly who was staying for the night, and Geoffrey came in to wish them goodnight. Zippy asked Geoffrey if he would also be sharing their bed, to which Geoffrey, who everyone generally assumed was gay, replied &quot;No Zippy, I'm sharing with Molly...&quot; Zippy's puppet jaw visibly hit the floor. Womderful stuff, you'd never get that in television these days <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I was a big Zippy fan, btw. We had a Zippy puppet for years, i used to terrorise the boy with it. 
<br />
<br />(btw Chip's clip won't play in any of my browsers, so maybe they're discusiingt he above, I dunno)
<br />
<br />Rainbow wasn't the only show that featured knowing adult humour. Captain Pugwash was notorious for its' double entendres and seaside postcrad names such as Master Bates, Seaman Staines, and Roger the Cabin Boy (even though he was actually called Tom, everyone remembers him as Roger, which probably says more about our filthy minds!) Good ol' Pugwash was revived a few years as part of the dearth of original ideas amongst broadcasters, but duly sanitised for the modern audience, and consequently wasn't even remotely amusing. 
<br />
<br />The Magic Roundabout, a classic of children's entertainment, was renowned for many now dispreputable aspects, including Dougal's ascerbic political comments about Harold Wilson and Ted Heath, his constant criticism of BBC weathermen, his curious addiction to sugar (a reference to cocaine) and Dylan's mind-numbing carrots that he ate in a most peculiar way (ie they were meant to be marijuana, reefers) Actually when you think about it, it really was quite subversive, but it was wonderful entertainment and I loved it, from the time I was about 4 until it finally went off the air in the 70s. A brave attempt was made to revive it some years ago, with Nigel Planer narrating in a similar style to Eric Thompson, but as with all things, it had had its day.
<br />
<br />Then of course there were Itsy and Bitsy, which took teenage lust to a whole new dimension as the two fluffy spiders crawled all over Susan Stranks' amply filled t-shirt. My godfathers, you'd never get away with that these days! It was great fun to watch though!
<br />
<br />I recently found out that the Clangers were actually swearing! the hooting noises they made were representations of swear words, and apparently at the time the BBC were rather worried about this, especially as the series was being exported. However, when asked, foreign viewers insisted that the Clangers were in fact speaking their own languages - a German audience insisted that they were indeed speaking perfect German and that they understood every word (well, hoot)
<br />
<br />And then there was Blue Peter - who could ever forget Simon Groom's famous comment when discussing door furniture, &quot;well, what a lovely pair of knockers...&quot; or his introduction of a Russian gymnast as &quot;Olga Yabollockov&quot; (because he couldn't remember her name)
<br />
<br />And of course Trumpton, and Chigley, and Camberwick Green; does anyone to this day know who the father of Mrs Honeyman's baby was? there was never any Mr Honeyman around, and she spent an awful lot of time with Chippy Minton after all. Or Windy Miller. 
<br />
<br />the Herbs were the best though, imo; what exactly <i>was </i> going on in that garden? it was a very surreal programme indeed &quot;I'm a rather fat feathery owl called Sage, I'm often quite muddled and get in a rage...&quot;
<br />
<br />(i do have most of these series on video and dvd, Mrs Taw and I will sit and watch them quite happily, although she's more of a Pogles' Wood fan, whilst I'm more for Noggin the Nog and Ivor the Engine myself.)</div>
