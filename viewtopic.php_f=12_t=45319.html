			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p34763" class="post-subject">New Web Hosting Cooperative</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">FuitadNET, the troubled little ship that is my current web host is sinking, it will start to break up sooner than later and I need to find new hosting ASAP. Over the past week I looked at several dozen other web hosts but I consistently get the same feeling, they're like greedy little used car dealers. Problem is I can't afford a dedicated server on my own. Seems to me the best solution to this problem is setting up a non-profit web hosting cooperative with one or more dedicated servers.
<br />
<br />Hosting prices will be set at cost and all records will be published on the main site (financial and resource usage statements). All community sites will run Google ads and/or accept donations to cover their share of the hosting. All profits will go into a community pool to invest in new hardware.
<br />
<br />A single team of volunteer staff members will manage the hosting cooperative community (including server administration) and all other community sites (OL, game/mod forge, and others). General policy will be set by a council of webmasters, consisting of paid account holders and community site senior staff, and chaired by the server admins (myself included). Each community will essentially be a democratic-technocratic hybrid, whereby each staff member is elected based on their having general community respect and the technical competence necessary to be a staff member. Most major community decisions will be handled first by the council and then left up to a general community vote. The paying customers can have as much or as little involvement in the coop community as they see fit, but at minimum will have a equal voice in the council.
<br />
<br />I have some more details typed up, mainly based on using <a href='http://www.theplanet.com/' Target=_Blank>The Planet</a> for a server host, but first I want to know who might be interested in being a part of this project. Anyone who is paying for typical commercial web hosting could save some money and at the same time gain more control over their hosting arrangement.
<br />
<br />Also, does anyone have a solid alternative to using The Planet or a dedicated server I could use at cost to jump start this project?
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />Update: The Planet is looking less and less attractive, I talked to a sales rep and posted <a href='http://forums.theplanet.com/index.php?showtopic=85895' Target=_Blank>this thread</a> on their forums. Now I'm looking at XL Host, EZZI, and I-Web as possible alternatives.
<br />
<br />For the coop structure, the community sites can't be expected to carry their own weight as a share of the server cost. Instead ad revenue and donations will be used to subsidize a dedicated game/TS/IRC server, provide operating cash for server upgrades, and fund advertising, anything left over will go towards covering server costs. This means higher prices and less hosting resources for people buying into the coop but its going towards a good cause. At the same time community sites will not get a full share of the server resources, so they'll all need to be as streamlined as possible.
<br />
<br />With that in mind, MP server communities, clan/groups, and other community sites will be hosted for free in exchange from running ads (subdomain off of the main community site). Mod development communities can get free hosting or be fully incorporated into the game forge site after that site is launched.
<br />
<br />Finally, just keep in mind it'll take a while before the coop is ready for business accounts or anything else &quot;mission critical&quot;. Expect some minor problems for the first few months.

			<div class="content">Alright, it looks like Josh needs a server as much as I do. We both need more people involved to split the cost on this, that'll also split the hosting resources. I don't like the idea of having a game server and a production web server on the same box, but it'll be fine until this grows enough to add more servers.
<br />
<br />Anyone have a dedicated linux box we can use?
<br />Anyone interested in joining the coop?
<br />Any ideas on a name for the coop community?

			<h3><a href="#p418808" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Needs to be dedicated for a growing list of reasons...
<br />I'm sick and tired of dealing with heavily oversold shared hosting on cheap web hosts, many of which sound more like used car dealers and some offer services they cannot possibly fulfill (just read a typical cheap host TOS and AUP statements). I'm also unwilling to pay the larger mark up on decent shared hosting, much of which includes value added managed services I don't need. A hosting coop on a dedicated server offers a volume of hosting resources on par decent shared hosting at (or below) the price of cheap shared hosting.
<br />
<br />Openlancer will, eventually, need a global server and that requires either special privileges on a shared server or our own dedicated server. It's a pretty good bet a commercial host would never allow us to run the global server on a production server, if they did it would probably cost extra. Too, if the server becomes available earlier it'll only go to help matters. 
<br />
<br />For my part, I always wanted a dedicated server. I looked at servers before getting my reseller account with FNET, just never had a way to pay for one. Now I can start a project that has a chance of not only getting a server but multiple servers.
<br />
<br />Dedicated game servers are a huge money sink but are vastly superior to typical game servers run off of residential broadband. The server itself uses more powerful and higher quality hardware than the typical retired game box used for home MP servers. The tier 1 or 2 backbone usually offers lower ping times and always allows for more players. With a large enough community that cost can be subsidized by community site ad revenue and donations.
<br />
<br />If you want a more practical examples:
<br />How does 40GB storage with 200GB/mo of transfer for $30/mo sound? In shared hosting terms thats pretty good. Now tack on the freedom to run any OS, any other software, not having to worry about being on an oversold server, not having to worry about someone hogging CPU time, and no limits on files or other typical shared hosting TOS/AUP crap limitations. Thats just the bottom of <a href='http://www.serverpronto.com/' Target=_Blank>ServerPronto's bargain bin</a>. Granted there is administrative overhead but thats not something I'm really worried about, with FNET I spent just as much time waiting for tech support. Problem is ServerPronto beats people to death with fees, like $29/ea for a server reboot, $75 for an OS reload, $150/hr for tech time, very high upgrade costs, expensive backup services, etc...
<br />
<br />After taking a serious look at the services we are likely to need to buy and reading a lot of customer feedback on WHT, I think <a href='http://www.softlayer.com' Target=_Blank>SoftLayer</a> is the best bet. Get 250GB storage and 2TB/mo transfer on a dual core system with a gig of RAM for $159/mo. Major benefits there include an internal private network with unlimited transfer for moving stuff between servers, file uploads, secure backups to NAS, private OS update server (Redhat), and other stuff. Includes free remote reboots, free OS reloads, a 1GB &#8220;lock box&#8221; (more of a virtual backpack for config files, critical data, and other stuff). If more storage is needed upgrading to 500GB storage is only another $20/mo (2x250GB SATA II HD's), can go up to 3TB storage for another $200/mo but thats kind of insane (4x750GB HD). Unmetered 10mbps lines are $100/mo. NAS backup options start at 20GB for $10/mo ($0.50/mo/G<img src=smilies/icon_smile_blackeye.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. RAM and bulk transfer upgrades are the only sticking point for me, 1GB DDR2 ECC RAM upgrade for $25/mo is too much and an extra 1TB/mo for $100/mo is too much, should have smaller increments.
<br />
<br />With 2GB RAM and a 20GB NAS backup that box can safely run both the game and web servers, and then some, with no problems. To order it I need at least 6 people involved (about $35/mo). SoftLayer has weekend specials/sales so this deal might get better come Friday night. Then again, theres always the chance someone has a dedicated server we can use for a little while to jump start this project.
<br />
<br />Well thats my long rant/ramble for the day. Interested in joining the coop?

<br />EDIT:
<br />Chips,
<br />Sorry, that rant was not directed at you. When I wrote that I had just ended an argument with an FNET support rep over major server down time while FNET staff were nowhere to be found, and whether or not they can tell the difference between their arse and a hole in the wall.
<br />
<br />EDIT2: Changing plans, trying to find something better suited for community members. This thread can be locked....
