			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p16544" class="post-subject">FLDQ - T-Hawk''s $1 million challenge</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">In the thread <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=23331&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Using+the+Rhino+for+missions+1+%2B+2+and+getting+rich+on+the+way&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;M=False&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank>Using the Rhino for missions 1 + 2 and getting rich on the way</a> T-Hawk has proposed a new challenge: complete the campaign with net worth at least $1 million as fast as you can. I am jumping into the breach because T-Hawk is indisposed for a couple of days (vacation or something I hear - my condolences <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ).
<br />
<br />So, here goes: winner is who has completed the campaign <b>and   </b> has net worth at least $1,000,000 in the shortest time. It does not matter whether you complete the campaign first and then start trading furiously, or if you go on a wreck looting spree during the campaign and then go beat the rest of the campaign. Conditions are level at least 18 and net worth at least $1,000,000 (which translates to level 31 anyway).
<br />
<br />I think this adds a nice twist to the existing FLDQ mode, which is to beat the campaign as fast as you can (with scores kept per number of battleships killed).
<br />
<br />Please post a screenie of your player info screen at completion time, either here or in the main FLDQ thread. I will list the top ten entries on the main <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=22502&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Competition%3A+FLDQ+%2D+Freelancer+Done+Quick&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;M=False&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank>FLDQ page</a> (FLDQ == Freelancer Done Quick) under the category FLDQ-M or something like that. If you cannot post screenies please contact me via email and we'll solve the problem somehow. Also, an article describing your campaign, your approaches, and the whys + why nots would be most welcome (preferrably here).
<br />
<br />In order to get you on the right track and save you false starts, here are some hints. Obviously, you need to have an idea where most of the $1 million is going to come from. Equally obviously, the answer is probably something like 'Sigma-13'. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Have a look at the FLDQ campaign write-ups in the thread <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=22637&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Freelancer+Done+Quick+%2D+hints+and+partial+walk%2Dthrough&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;M=False&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank>Freelancer Done Quick - hints and partial walk-through</a> and also the Rhino thread that I have mentioned already, in order to get an idea what finances look like on a fast run through the campaign and where additional monies can be obtained quickly. Then try to combine all this into a campaign plan and execute it. 
<br />
<br />If you fly the right ships at the right time then you can earn a lot of money by trading along the path of the campaign, without travelling to other bases (which costs time). On the other hand, flying a mission in a freighter is a tad more difficult &amp; time-consuming than doing so in a fighter, especially a well-equipped one. So choose carefully; sometimes you can even travel + trade (or loot <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) using a freighter and then purchase a fighter in order to fly the mission in question. 
<br />
<br />Also, consider carefully whether you need to hit a particular money source (depot, wreck, trade) or not. It does not matter a pair of dingo's kidneys whether you have $1,000,000 or $1,234,567 - you need to have at least $1,000,000 after the campaign and that's it. Hitting a depot or wreck (or doing a trade) does cost some time and there is no guarantee that the additional money will help you make up for the lost time. If your plan calls for you to have a certain ship and $90k for buying a hold full of some commodity at some place &amp; time then you need the ship and the $90k, but there is no guarantee that having more than $90k will be helpful. In fact, it could be that having only $70k would be enough actually and work just as well in the end. It is probably best if you make your plan so that it contains alternative options for contingencies - additional money-makers in case you are short of the sub-goal you have set, faster options in case you are ahead already.
<br />
<br />In order to make a top entry you need two things here: you need to have a good plan, and you you need to execute it well. It might be a good idea to practise by trying a classic FLDQ run first. There is a wealth of good plans for FLDQ runs in the threads I have mentioned already, and there are also plenty of hints for putting them into practice. Also, there is plenty of space in the top listings for new entries - just try it.
<br />
<br />Finally, if you have another idea for an interesting challenge/contest, please post it. Getting to level 38 quickly might be an option.
<br />
<br />P.S.: it is possible to beat T-Hawk's $1 million challenge <b>very fast   </b> by using freighters for missions 4 through 7 and well-equipped fighters for the other missions, if you go on a fast money-earning expedition to Sigma-13 at one point during the campaign. Also, Sigma-13 contains more than wrecks. Just a hint. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />P.P.S.: getting net worth to $1 million seems slightly easier than getting 17 registered battleship kills ... OTOH in FL you can make money faster as a trader than as a fighter, so perhaps this is not very surprising.

<br />
<br />i did the most time fighting, and i can do something else...
<br />
<br />- starflier, can do 5k missions in the begin...
<br />- patriot (highest so far for me was 20k missions)
<br />- drake, can do with only class 5 pyros type 2 guns div 43 missions...
<br />
<br />- so u can have in no time a vhf and be banned from the server <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />With the starflier u do 1 mission and then buy the patriot and go to kusari and do missions there... if u can buy the drake buy it and get in kyushu the class 6 graviton shield (research station) then go to freeport 10 (don't bribe) and kill all hunters what u can kill, if outcast is better the -2 blocks u go to malta, buy 4 class 5 pyros type 2 guns and do 240k missions... it's about 2 hours work...

			<h3><a href="#p201129" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content"><b>PunkZombie, </b> cool! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  The prize is eternal fame, of course. You'll get your very own listing in the <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=22502&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Competition%3A+FLDQ+%2D+Freelancer+Done+Quick&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;M=False&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank>FLDQ Hall of Fame</a> thread, and you'll have upped the ante for other contenders. As matters stand now, anybody could make a screenshot of a post-campaign SP character with $1 million net worth and make the top entry, even with a hundred hours played ... <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Like in the other FLDQ disciplines, the challenge here is actually two-fold. First you need to devise a good plan, and then you need to execute it well.
<br />
<br />A good plan needs to answer the following questions:
<br />(1) How am I going to level up fast during the free time after mission X?
<br />(2) Which ship and which equipment am I going to use for each step of the campaign?
<br />(3) Do I need to plan fund-raising operations to get the money for (1) and (2), and if so, which ops?
<br />
<br /><b>(1): </b>  There are several tricks for levelling up quickly. Many involve having the right amount of the right commodity in the hold of one's ship when a mission completes, so that selling said cargo will trigger the levelling-up. Early in the campaign it is sometimes sufficient to simply <b>buy </b> a minimum amount of a commodity like H-fuel to level up, and hitting a wreck like the Balboa in California is another good option. Quite often you need to chose your ship so that it has a big enough cargo hold for the required amount of the 'level-up commodity'. Have a look at the FLDQ threads and the threads linked from there to find out what the state of the art is regarding level-up tricks.
<br />
<br /><b>(2): </b>  Some ships are available on the bases you pass during the campaign so that you can buy them without time overhead for travelling, others are not available there or you pass the base at an inconvenient time. Yet other ships (Drake) have cargo holds that are too small to execute some level-up tricks. Similar considerations apply to weapons and other equipment; as a rule you have to make do with stuff that you can get along the path of the campaign or that can be gotten fairly quickly (e.g., the 2 minutes for hitting the Balboa in California give you a Pyros Turret Type 1 and two Pyros Type 2 guns, in addition to $30k's worth of cardamine).
<br />
<br /><b>(3): </b>  There are not many options for raising the extra cash that may be required for levelling up or for obtaining ships/equipment. The two major options are looting depots/wrecks that are conveniently close to your travel route, and trading along the path of the campaign, like buying gold from on the Hood during mission 6 and selling it on New Tokyo shortly before mission 8. Of course, for the $1 million challenge this is the most important aspect because you need quite a lot of extra cash compared to a normal FLDQ run. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  A typical FLDQ run ends with a net worth around the $100k mark (give or take a couple ten thousand), so you need to raise roughly $900k extra for the $1 million challenge - either during the campaign or after.
<br />
<br />Hitting the wrecks in Sigma-13 during the Kusari phase of the campaign takes roughly 15 minutes and nets you somewhere between half a million and tree quarters, depending on which trades you do along the way (Honshu, Yanagi, New Tokyo) and how big the cargo hold of your ships is. Also, when you are there anyway you can pick up the two class 6 Angelitos from the wreck near the Sigma-13 jumphole in Honshu - the rest of the campaign is more fun if you have good guns like these. 
<br />
<br />On a lazy trial run I used fighters for missions 1 through 3 but freighters for missions 4 through 7 (Rhino, Clydesdale, Dromedary) to do a bit of trading on the side and to have ample storage for the loot from the Interspace H-fuel depots near New London. This way I already had enough money to retire after returning from the Sigma-13 expedition, and so I could fly the rest of the campaign in fighters (Barracuda, Anubis) from Shinagawa onwards. 
<br />
<br />Once you have an overall plan you can refine it a bit. Buying the Dromedary after mission 5 is rather time-consuming unless the Outcasts are non-hostile, so it may be a good idea to hit the Interspace depots near New London on the way to mission 5. The detour and destroying 9 depot pods for rep adjustment take less than a minute (even if you touch down on Planet New London first to sell some goods and buy some guns) and the 125 units of H-fuel that the Clydesdale can tractor from the wreckage fetch a tidy sum on Planet Cambridge. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  On the other hand, if you don't want to buy the Dromedary then you can go directly from Leeds to Cambridge after mission 4 and sell 80 Luxury Consumer Goods (from Manhattan) and as much optronics as you were able to buy on Leeds. Decisions, decisions ...
<br />
<br />So much for the plan. As I said, having a good plan is important but it is equally important to execute it well, and so you have to factor your skills into the equation. For example, you can get the Rhino during mission 1 already and this means you can tractor a whole lot more H-fuel from the depot near Baltimore Shipyard and make much more money trading rather early, besides having pulse weapons and a lot of raw firepower during missions 1 and 2. But somebody with mediocre freighter combat skills (like me) may be better off flying the first three or four missions in fighters <b>or </b> acquiring an extra bit of freighter combat skill by preying on pirate convoys just for practice. Also, the fastest mission 1 time on record is 16:55 minutes (Criminal Base Destroyed savepoint) but I have flown this mission over a minute faster (15:45) with the same ship/equipment and overall strategy as for the 16:55 run, just by using better tactics and because I improved my plasma weapon gunnery skills by fooling around with Flamecurses. So, the performance during the combat portions of the missions does make a significant difference.
<br />
<br />There are quite a number of tactics and tricks that can help you beat campaign missions faster, and many of them (but not all) have been posted already in the threads related to FLDQ. The rules require the incumbents (currently T-Hawk and me) to divulge their tricks and secrets if asked, and my offer to write a detailed walk-through for the first three to four missions if there is enough interest still stands. But one of the main tricks is this: if you choose to fly a mission with a certain ship and equipment then you need quite a bit of combat experience with that ship/weapon combo up front in order to fly a good time. This is not unlike a kata in Karate - the whole kata takes less than a minute but acquiring the necessary skills and practicing moves takes a whole lot longer. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Also, I won't compete in the $1 million challenge unless somebody challenges me personally (preferrably with a time around 04:15 h or less) - I have already 'burned' some other FLDQ modes by posting times that are probably too difficult to beat. There is still a lot of room in the 'unmodded' category: a skilled player could beat the current best time for no battleship kills (05:52) by more than an hour, and any time at all (even 100 hours) would get you top rank if you have at least one registered battleship kill. The 'modded' category is currently bracketed by my T0 and T17 entries, so it is not easy to get <b>top </b> rank with between 0 and 17 battleship kills. With 18 battleship kills or more any time at all wins.</div>

			<div class="content">Heh.  I suppose my absence from this thread might be rather noticeable. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Truth is, I'm pretty much tired of Freelancer.  Haven't played it at all in a month or so.  Loaded it up once or twice, but honestly the appeal of playing as fast as possible doesn't appeal to me much now; I play games to relax, not to get stressed out more. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  I might take a shot at this or another FLDQ run eventually, but probably not for some time.

			<div class="content">If you're played out ATM then let the game rest. There are plenty of other things to do and you can always pick the game up again when you feel the challenge. And I bet you will eventually, since so far nobody has attained 'four star' rank (20 battleship kills or more - with 5 BS kills equalling one star, depicted as <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> in the Hall of Fame listing) and if memory serves your top rank is one star currently - just one battleship kill shy of two stars. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />Myself I rarely play FL currently - perhaps one hour per week. If I play at all then I play mostly Borland Delphi 7 Professional and the C++ mode of MS Visual Studio .NET 2003 - I guess you could class them text adventures. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
