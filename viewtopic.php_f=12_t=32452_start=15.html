			<div class="content">Arton, Hope your talking about telling the dogs to shut up.....
<br />
<br />You have to be considerate to others. You and dog owners don't find barking that annoying unless its continuous and in the same room as you. However, for others its intolerable. Same as if your next door neighbour was a construction worker, you probs wouldn't like it if at all hours he started using heavy and loud machinery for extended periods of time as well.
<br />
<br />Now dogs aren't as bad as road machinery in volume, not usually anyways - but then again, it wouldn't take around 4 months before you complained to them either!!!!
<br />
<br />Treat others as you hope to be treated yourself.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p298026" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I sympathise with you 100% Recusant. Our neighbours are the biggest bunch of pricks in Auckland. This all begins with one of our former tenants, who due to certain circumstances(i.e we're poor) they live in a house in front of our one. Now, this woman, was a complete b***h. Her friends couldn't walk a few extra metres, so they parked on the main driveway, preventing us from leaving our home. Her kid made friends with kids that left black marks all over the driveway despite the fact that we asked her politely to get her kid to not ride his bike on the brand new driveway. Seeing as the avenue we live in hardly sees any cars and has plenty of space to ride a bike it's not unreasonable to ask her for that. She refused, she didn't pay the rent for about two weeks one time. Around Christmas, my mother bought her son a present, she said goodbye before she left for her holiday. Knowing the rent wouldn't be paid, she left us with no money on Christmas.
<br />
<br />There was a major pipe leak in the yard, and she didn't report it until it had been going for hours. You could easily hear the water running in the house, but she ignored it. That cost us hundreds in the water bill. Soon she started being evil, and called around all of the neighbours for a party for the sole purpose of inciting hatred towards us. She spread lies and rumour about us too. When my mother finally booted her out, she took us to the tenancy tribunal. She spat out all sorts of lies and got her last power bill free. So basically she won.
<br />
<br />Now here comes the evil neighbours bit. Because of her, people who had never even met us before, wrote in letters saying stuff like, &quot;although I have never spoken to them before from what Jasmine[tenant has said, they are horrible people.&quot; People made up lies about how they saw my mother staggering down the road drunk at night. That's funny, I didn't know people had night-vision. The tenant alleged my mother was an alcoholic, my mother had to get people to testify that wasn't the case. The neighbours even helped to tenant to sort through our rubbish for anything like bottles of beer and took photos of them neatly lined up.
<br />
<br />What makes me angry, is that we have a sweet, lovable dog. The only danger you have from her is being licked to death she's so friendly to everyone. One of the evil neighbours actually said that when they came to feed the tenants cat the dog lunged at them. I felt like going over and beating the crap outta that *****. After that ordeal, almost all of the neighbours hated us. The tenant went around the street trying to get neighbours to testify against us, some of them didn't even know who we were. The final insult was when the neighbours behind us, who have noisy cars, constantly played loud music out of their car stereo. Almost every weekend during the whole afternoon. My mother finally got sick of it and talked to them, the guy tried to intimidate her, insulted her and after she left they issued us a trespass notice against us. It's making me so angry just typing this. So yeah, that's my story.
<br />
<br />People have it all wrong these days, instead of discriminating and hating others for being black or ugly, we should practise fairness and hate every living thing equally.</div>

			<div class="content">Thanks to her, none of the neighbours who knew us were on speaking terms, they just glared at us or hurried away. Besides, it's too late, she's moved down country. I wish defamation was a crime in NZ. The US have definitely got it right with their justice system. The one here is useless. I want to get her back so badly. During the compulsary mediation she barraged my mother with non-stop insults while the mediator did nothing to stop her. It was so much my mother broke down and cried after the mediation was over.

			<div class="content">to get a bit more serious than normal, i think these stories indicate what a terrible state as a society we're in, not just the UK, but all over the Western world, the english-speaking countries especially, with regards to &quot;neighbours from hell&quot; and people simply not being able to get on with each other in everday life.
<br />
<br />i think it's because, amongst many other reasons, we have too litigious a society where people can invoke courts and police (and the time and expense comcomitant to those) for what are really rather frivolous issues, but compounded with this we've created a culture in which everyone has a issue and who's point-of-view must be respected, no matter how stupid or nasty that p.o.v. is, and justice has nothing to do with what's true or right but with what can be &quot;proved&quot; or &quot;disproved&quot;
<br />
<br />related story :-
<br />when I was a kid, a woman came to live next door to us who would put out food for stray dogs, oh very kind yes, but every dam dog in the neighbourhood would come round for a free feed. At almost any hour of the day you couldn't walk beyond your gate for there being dogs all around, usuallly at least a dozen of all shapes and sizes. This obv wasnt very satisfactory, what with dog-crap, cars, pedestrians etc. To cap it all the mad old witch didnt have a dog of her own but just threw bones and scraps out for every stray for miles.
<br />
<br />My mother got bitten several times and our cats were often chased and terrorised by what in effect was a dog-pack protecting its territory. Dog wardens would come and remove the dogs, issue awarning notice, but still it went on. This mad dear was about 70 after all so what are the authorities going to do to her, really? bob all.
<br />
<br />Needless to say there was bad blood between her and my mother, and one time after one of the cats got mauled my mother went absolutley ballistic with her, real full on screaming in the street, as you can imagine I was egging my mum on and generally stirring up trouble (we lived in a very dull place!)
<br />
<br />One evening i was walking back up the hill past her house and just idly running my hands along the wall and the hedge, whistling away, and the insane old bat opened up her window and started screaming at me for vandalising her property, the next thing morning the cops were round our house and hauled me away on an accusation of criminal damage. didnt get very far, but created a lot of trouble at home cos my dad was always of the opinion that if the police arrest you, you must have done something wrong and how would it reflect on him? Fortunately my mother was a bit more sensible about it, but in the end my parents moved house while i was away at sea because my mother just couldnt take it anymore. Despite all the warnings and all the strife, the insane cow was still feeding stray dogs but throwing meat out at nightime so that no-one would see her (but they did)
<br />
<br />if you do have bad neighbours, then it's a curse and until either you or they move, ytou're stuck with them.</div>
