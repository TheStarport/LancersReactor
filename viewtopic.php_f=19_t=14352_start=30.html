<br />You ass.  Don't clutter up my thread with that useless garbage.
<br />
<br />@Everyone else
<br />
<br />I just reinstalled my operating system last night due to some corrupt driver cache issues.  That was fun.  I didn't lose anything important, but it set me back a couple days in getting a site up and running for us.
<br />
<br />We've got a rough draft of the code of honor in Word format, I'll post it right after I'm done here.  Good news, I've got an Athlon XP 2000+ for the machine upgrade in the mail already.  Upgrading my motherboard BIOS is what caused the driver cache to **** the bed, so you know exactly what I'm going through to get this to work for you. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content"><b>The Role of Honor in the Black Lotus Clan: </b>
<br />
<br />Honor is a like a sharpened blade: if not handled properly, it can potentially hurt you as much as it can hurt your opponent.  You are to live and die by the Black Lotus Code of Honor.  Failure to adhere to the Black Lotus Code of Honor will damage your Honor Rank, and may potentially exile you from the clan.
<br />
<br />Each clan member will have an Honor Rank.  This rank may increase or decrease depending on your own actions.  Great acts of selflessness to benefit the clan or another clan member will periodically increase your Honor Rank.  Acts of cowardice, lying, betrayal, will lower your Honor Rank.  If you decrease your Honor Rank below shodan (1st rank), then you become permanently dishonored and you are cast out of the Black Lotus clan.  A newly accepted clan member shall begin with an Honor Rank of sandan (3rd rank).
<br />
<br /><b>Honor Ranks: </b>
<br />
<br />Fumeiyo (dishonor) &#8211; removal from the clan roster, and marked as an enemy of the clan
<br />Shodan (1st rank)
<br />Nidan (2nd rank)
<br />Sandan (3rd rank) &#8211; Beginning Honor Rank for new clan members
<br />Yondan (4th rank)
<br />Godan (5th rank)
<br />Rokudan (6th rank)
<br />Shichidan (7th rank)
<br />Hachidan (8th rank)
<br />Kudan (9th rank)
<br />Judan (10th rank) &#8211; Highest Honor Rank attainable
<br />
<br />With honor comes great responsibility.  As you increase in honor, your expectations increase.  A Sandan (3) coming to another clan members aid in great need may be deemed worthy enough to raise the Sandan (3) to Yondan (4).  However, a Kudan (9) is expected to come to the aid of his clansmen and allies, and cannot increase his rank through one single effort of aid.  Additionally, those with higher honor are also examined more carefully.  A Judan (10) that tells a single inconsequential lie jeopardizes his honor more than a Nidan (2) that also tells an inconsequential lie.
<br />
<br />An increase in Honor Rank may be bestowed to a clan member after submitting a petition to the clan.  The petition shall consist of recently accounted feats of honor, and may also include testimony from fellow clan members.  Petitions will be presented to the entire clan for a vote, and pending the outcome of the vote, the petitioner&#8217;s Honor Rank with be modified.
<br />
<br />Loss of Honor Rank, unfortunately, comes somewhat faster.  Typically, all it takes is one witness of dishonorable acts to lower a clan member&#8217;s Honor Rank.  Witnessing such acts is also shameful, as the witness is present when the dishonor occurs.  The loss of honor all together is extremely shameful, and unfortunately will occur even in some of the best circumstances.
<br />
<br /><b>The Black Lotus Code of Honor:
<br />
<br />A Black Lotus stays the fight.  The coward flees. </b>
<br />
<br />If you fight, you fight until the death.  If an aggressor attacks you, you must defend yourself.  Under certain time-sensitive circumstances, it is acceptable for a flight of clan members to divide: one group to combat the aggressors, the other group to continue toward their destination.  This is not considered an act of cowardice as long as the group that is left to defend is adequate for the threat encountered.  In all other cases, face your opponent without withdrawing.
<br />
<br />If an enemy attempts to flee, do not give him chase.  A coward shall suffer more in shame than in death.
<br />
<br />One witnessed/reported act of cowardice shall result in the loss of one Honor Rank.
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus keeps his word.  The liar betrays. </b>
<br />
<br />Your word is your honor.  Keep it no matter what.  Liars have no place among us.  If you make a promise to someone, your honor depends on your fulfillment of that promise.
<br />
<br />One witnessed/reported broken word or act of lying shall result in the loss of two Honor Ranks.
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus does not crush the weak and unprotected.  The parasite feeds upon the defenseless. </b>
<br />
<br />Defeating the unarmed is not an honorable victory.  Incredibly outnumbering a single opponent brings no honor to the clan.  If you are up against an opponent that is no match for you (or your group), inform them of such if possible, and ignore them.  Do not provoke the situation.  If that opponent decides to pursue you, defend yourself as necessary.  Unfortunately the outnumbered or outgunned can be stupid, and your honor is not in question in these circumstances.
<br />
<br />A pattern of mercilessly aggressive acts committed against the outnumbered or under-gunned shall be evaluated and may result in the loss of one Honor Rank.
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus treats peers with mutual esteem.  The vain raise themselves above others. </b>
<br />
<br />We must treat each other with respect.  We all seek to increase the honor of the clan as a whole, as well as our personal honor.  This is not achieved by being rude, crass, or haughty.  We must work together as a clan in harmony with one another.
<br />
<br />Outright rudeness and disrespect against another clan member (witnessed by the recipient, and at least one other clan member) shall result in the loss of one Honor Rank.
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus bows to those more honorable.  The envious feign reverence. </b>
<br />
<br />While respecting all clan members, we must also recognize those that have achieved greater honor.  Someone with a greater Honor Rank is not necessarily in charge, per say, but shall offered a greater respect and reverence.  Suggestions and instructions from these clan members should be carefully considered, as their greater Honor Rank indicates that they have done a number of honorable deeds.
<br />
<br />Outright rudeness and disrespect against a clan member of greater Honor Rank shall result in the loss of one Honor Rank.
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus defends his clan and allegiances.  The treacherous attack unsuspecting allies. </b>
<br />
<br />When a clan member is in peril, make every effort to aid him.  There is great honor in coming to your comrade&#8217;s aid.  There is no dishonor in accepting assistance, unless you are involved in a private quarrel or duel.  As we work to build cohesiveness between those of the Black Lotus, we must also protect those whom we have political ties with and those whom we do commerce with.  Through these ties will strengthen the clan, and solidify our dominance.  There is no honor in betrayal.
<br />
<br />One witnessed/reported act of betrayal shall result in the loss of two Honor Ranks.
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus fights enemies on a level battlefield.  The spineless exploit disadvantage.  </b>
<br />
<br />Exploiting your enemy in a moment of weakness is no display of combat prowess.  You bring no honor to the clan or to yourself by taking advantage of a lumbering opponent.  If your opponent is docking with a planet, trade lane, or a jump gate, they are effectively defenseless.  Any child can rip apart a freighter that is docking with a jump gate given the correct vector and throttle.  To take advantage of an opponent in this manner, you may as well consider yourself a child.
<br />
<br />One witnessed/reported act of harassing an opponent that is completely defenseless shall result in the loss of one Honor Rank.
<br />
<br /><b>A Black Lotus seeks death before dishonor.  The fearful cling to life even in disgrace. </b>
<br />
<br />Death, in any form, is less painful than dishonor to a clan member.  This is stated last in the code as a reminder of the importance of honor.</div>

<br />1. Might be better to use &quot;Nanadan&quot; instead of &quot;Shichidan&quot;.
<br />
<br />2. &quot;With honor comes great responsibility. As you increase in honor&quot; means: &quot;With higher rank of honor comes greater responsibility. As you increase in rank....&quot;  I think either you have honor or you do not, we can rank not the honor but an ability to display it (or it's absence).
<br />
<br />3. It reads like one should submit an application for one's HR promotion. I see no honor in asking to increase your honor <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />4. &quot;One witnessed/reported act of cowardice shall result in the loss of one Honor Rank&quot;. I see no honor in reporting dishonorable acts. Although lack of face-to-face communication...should be compensated somehow.
<br />
<br />Everything else sounds very good. Thank you for your work.</div>
