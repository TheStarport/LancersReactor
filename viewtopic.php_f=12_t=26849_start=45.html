<br />Thx.  Just call me a musical troglodyte.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />@WLB:  Spock... I always liked him the most followed by Whorf.  Remember the first TNG season when all the men wore padded shoulders?  It was very comically distracting to me.  Riker minced about with his head cocked to one side, torso slightly twisted so that one shoulder preceded the other when he walked.  I thought that either he constantly had to use suppositories or he was a graduate of the &quot;Bad Imitation of John Wayne School of Acting.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />My favorite TNG hottie is Tasha Yar.  The episode in which she finds out how complete Data's design and construction actually is has her in some pretty dishy outifts. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />Like it really mattered which outfit <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  
<br />
<br />BUT which was sexier to you?  With her air up and tidy or down?  Oddly I found it more attractive when it was up.  It really did something amazing to her face and the shape of her head.  (When I was looking at her head and face, that is). <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />Yeah.  But that's what the beauty of the Data episode was all about.  I had thought, to that point, that she was just very much a bull d&amp;#@ type character and then, well, my memory is a little blurred but well, she wore some very revealing things in that episode and it was a real eye opener for me and well.... I'd describe what I saw if I didn't think it would be ummmm uncool for the Mods.  Hubba hubba.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade> Jadzie   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I was going to say, of course.  I thought she was great except that.... well, her voice was little too reedy for me.  Now 7's voice.  Love that huskier note.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade> Yeoman Rand   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Mmmmmmm.  Now she was quite the dish. But she had Big Hair.  I never iked Big Hair.  Imagine her in, say, 7's costume today, or T'Pols.  NBC would have been censored off the air!
<br />
<br />The others, well Deanna always got on my nerves.  Her diction was too perfect for me.  It made me jumpy.  It's that English english learned by a non-native in which every syllable is just too perfectly pronounced thing.  Right up there with finger nails on the chalkboard. 
<br />
<br />Hey, I just realized something ... you've expressed a liking of blondes.  That's news to me too!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Well cheers to that then!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">@Esquilax: listen you bunny, there IS a difference. You may not think so but the rest of the world DOES. y'see a trekkie is a term for those who jumped on board with the skin-tight uniforms, touchy-feely gene roddenbery episodes of yesteryear. Thats FINE by me, but i always thought most of those episodes were a load of tripe. A trekker is the modern day fan. One who came on board after Star Trek was brought back, mainly after Gene died and a bit of tallent went into the show (a bit..not alot, that didnt come till ds9 remember) and the universe got a whole lot better. Of course you can be both. Old trekkies are perfectly capable of liking the new stuff with a passion, its more like &quot;older fans of an older generation&quot; = trekkie
<br />&quot;younger generation&quot; = trekker. Sure you can be older generation and still call yourself a trekker just cause you like the name. but for the most part, trekkies are pleased with their moniker so dont bother.
<br />
<br />Dont want to show you up. but its quite obvious the difference.
<br />
<br />now then:
<br />
<br />Fave hotties:
<br />T'Pol - Nicest of the lot. Anyone seen her photo shoot for FHM? i had to sit down.
<br />Seven - Great ass!
<br />Leeta - HOOOOOOOOOT, she properly buttered my muffins every thursday at 6:00pm sharp. No talent to speak of but the best rack in the Federation
<br />Ezri Dax - cute as hell!
<br />Hoshi Sato - anyone see the episode of Enterpise when she went topless. One of my faves anyway <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />B'elanna Torres - Wayhay. When she's all hot from doing klingonny battle stuff. More sonic shower scenes please!
<br />
<br />Overall best characters:
<br />Worf - shoulda been called Commander &quot;Kick your sorry human ass&quot; Worf
<br />Quark - Would sell his mother..in fact i think he did, multiple times. the scamp.
<br />The Doctor - Bedside manner stolen from bones, this dude made Voyager almost worth watching
<br />Garak - Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy...literally. This guy was the bizomb!
<br />Will Riker - only bearded riker, shaven riker can **** right off. Probably the most capable first officer in starfleet, if he can stop kissing picards ass
<br />Ben Sisco - the badass captain. This guy you want leading. Plus he has the inside scoop on the gods...how cool is that?!
<br />Sulu (only Original guy worth having, and the only one who actually made a career out of Starfleet instead of refusing to do anything)
<br />pretty much ALL the Cardassian head group. ****, all the main characters for DS9 were just kick ass.
<br />
<br />and now..
<br />Worst star trek characters EVER:
<br />Keiko O'Brien - DIE!!
<br />Vic Fonatine - SHUT THE HELL UP! STOP SINGING!
<br />Chakotay  - No one CARES about your damn VISION QUESTS
<br />Jake Sisco - Stop existing!

<br />I am not surprised that this has turned into a thread about the women of ST. ST and the female actresses seem to go hand-in-hand. I think this is one of the ways in which  ST has retained its popularity over the years.

<br />By the way, I'm watching the TNG episode &quot;Pegasus&quot; as I type. It's a very good episode. Familiar with it?

			<div class="content">OK... ridiculous ST trivia.  Actually, can it even be trivia when it is all made up anyway?
<br />
<br />The non-use of a cloaking device by the Federation is alleged to have become binding in the  Treaty of Alpha Trianguli, and/or according to the TNG episode The Defector and again in Pegasus The Treaty of Algeron ...a world orbiting Alpha Trianguli?
<br />
<br />But it made no sense to me.  Why would anyone agree only to fight a battle to the death with one hand tied behind his proverbial back?
