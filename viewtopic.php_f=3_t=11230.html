			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p5142" class="post-subject">FL rocket concept rather.. questionable?</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">A few of you maybe already know me from the spoiler/editing boards, but for the others - I'm on lvl38 and have played about 50h of FL just counting SP mode and - moreover - I have worked my way rather deep into the game files in the last days as well. 
<br />
<br />And by all means, FL is a really great game - but nonetheless I'm convinced that that still must not mean that all constructive criticism should go hide in a corner. Now, on to the subject...
<br />
<br />Judging from my experience, rockets have three characteristics that make them useful in games, and for some reason or another, <b>neither  </b> of them seems to really apply in Freelancer.
<br />
<br /><b>#1) the &quot;toybox/toolbox&quot; factor  </b>
<br />A rather small aspect - namely that rockets sometimes carry functionalities that are not present in any other weapon, such as EMP payloads, stun effects or, like in FL, cruise disruptors. Well, FL has  a bit of this aspect, but it only offers that cruise disruptor projectile and a small series of EMP-anti-shield rockets - that unfortunately don't make too much sense, see #2 and #3 for more. 
<br />Plus, I found myself fruitlessly looking for things such as a cluster/swarm missile or a flashpack, just to name a few nifty toys from other games.
<br />
<br /><b>#2) the &quot;damage blast&quot; factor  </b>
<br />Another important raison d'etre  for rockets is that they are usually able to deliver a nice amount of damage in a single strike, thus weakening too-strong enemies or killing weakened ones. Let's look at FL again. The rocket damage payloads may look acceptable at first, but it doesn't take too long in the game until your blaster weapon phalanx delivers even more damage in a single volley of shots. Now, in any other game, rockets would still be perfectly worth the while because of factor #3. Unfortunately, #3 is where most of FL's rocket problems boil down to.
<br />
<br /><b>3) the &quot;fire and forget&quot; factor  </b>
<br />In my opinion, the main task of a rocket should be to 'get you out of a tight spot' - because, unlike normal weaponry, they are costly and so typically you only use them when in deeper trouble. 
<br />A standard situtation would be the follwoing: you're currently fighting multiple enemies and you want to turn your attention to the next one before actually having to hunt down the first to the very end. So, after significantly damaging your first opponent, you usually fire a rocket at him, lock on to the next target and wait for his blip to disappear from your scanners while you're barraging your new target. But this won't work in FL.
<br />
<br />Admitted, at first it may sound like an interesting idea to &quot;aid&quot; your rockets aim by somewhat 'guiding' their path with your crosshair. Unfortunately, I found this to be utterly inappropriate in combination with the rest of FLs rocket concept. 
<br />Why? Well, if you have to somewhat &quot;keep track&quot; of your enemy with your reticle anyway to make the rocket hit, it is more efficient to fire at him with your normal blasters. Let's say an average FL missile needs 2.5 seconds of &quot;reticle guiding&quot; until it slams into the chosen target. (and this is a fairly optimistic guess in a standard situation) Now, if one compares the blasters and rockets that are available at certain points of progress in the game story, it becomes obvious that the damage which a good blaster can dish out in those 2-3 seconds is the same or even substantially higher than the payload of the best missiles that are available then.
<br />
<br />To make it worse, missile launchers and blasters take the same hardpoints. That means that if you equip a rocket, you have to give up a blaster for it, meaning that during the 3s of &quot;reticle guiding&quot; you could as well dish out more damage if you had a blaster in that sixth slot instead of the currently non-firing missile launcher.
<br />
<br />&lt;...&gt;
<br />
<br />So... where exactly is the point of using missiles then? Maybe apart from the very early stages of the game where your blasters are comparably &quot;weaker&quot; than your rockets? (not to mention that you probably don't have the cash to buy many rockets anyway then) Moreover, I don't really like the idea of 'mixed combat' where you fire blasters and missiles at the same target at the same time because you will easily lose track of the enemies exact health rating then - and therefor fire maybe costly missiles for naught.
<br />
<br />There'd be many ways to save the system, like for example giving the missiles a significantly higher damage than a blaster can deliver in the couple seconds of &quot;reticle guidance&quot; and make them much more expensive in turn - or indroducing 'missile hardpoints' - or making at least the so-called &quot;homing&quot; missiles really &quot;self-homing&quot; and not only &quot;more maneuvrable than unguided ones&quot;. Well, I'm a bit into modding and at least I'd be able to realize the first idea - but I ask myself &quot;is this really my  duty and not rather that of the devs?&quot;. Of course I could make such a mod, but it's far easier for me and others to just use blasters - this is simply an aspect that should have been properly tweaked in the very beginning instead of being modded afterwards. 
<br />
<br />Any comments on that? I freely admit that I may have missed an important point speaking in favor of FLs current missile concept, but currently I simply don't see it. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />I have the torpedo launcher though, but I don't use it much either ... in the story missions it is the best thing against the battlecruisers, but the biggest thing in a random mission is the &quot;large space station&quot; that is easily destroied with a few seconds of heavy blaster fire ... anyway, a torpedo launcer looks good on a sabre <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">first off, Ronin, cool sig pic... second off, i was just wondering the same as you, and the only thing I had been using missiles for was to take out or weaken cap ships, because i would swing by on a strafe pattern and fire 3 or 4 missiles and then weave away out of their turrets (I am in a crusader, 3 angelito mk1, one adv skyrail, one adv stunpulse, one windstalker.) and then would repeat until the cap ship was weakened enough for me to risk a head on blaster run. I realized that after attaining level 10, I could now purchase  the starkiller torp launcher. looking at the dmg and cost, one starkiller does 1200 shield, while the wstalker does only 240 (i think) for the 373 creds it takes, over the 119 for wstalker, the cost is more efficient for the torp. hence I have dropped my wstalker and now use torps and blasters (not to mention adding another class 4 hardpoint, which i filled with a skyrail.) 
<br />
<br />and what IS the deal with the missiles. there should be a lock on bleep or notice for the homing missiles. I never know when to fire or to wait just that extra second more, but then the enemy has passed me or gone out of view, so......
<br />
<br />and which ones are un guided, and how can you tell?

			<div class="content">Just to try 'em out, I fired off a couple Firestalker missiles (the best homing missile you can get, AFAIK) at an Outcast Stiletto in Sigma-13 that was pestering me. Well, they were evaded with seeming ease -- 15K credits down the tubes -- so I proceeded to wax him with guns. But suddenly, there's a whole bunch of GMG Hawks all over me, and I thought I was *friendly* with the GMG! I beat it out of there and ditched the Hawks in the gas cloud. In pulling up my status to re-check my faction standing with the GMG, I noticed I now had another transport kill. It seems the missiles had found a target, after all. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So, in addition to being of questionable effectiveness, and very costly, this is one more reason why I don't like to use the homers.</div>

<br />personally i never used missles except in the first few missions where your guns really sucked
<br />
<br />after that, the only projectile weapon i used are the torpedoes, those do lots of damage
<br />
<br />some wonder why do you even put firestalkers on when a nomad cannon does more damage over time? and one nomad cannon actually cost aroud the same as a firestalker missle <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Well, my Eagle does have a pair of Cannonball Missile Launchers on it.  I don't use them nearly as much as my main weapons (for the same reasons other people aren't using them) but I felt I should just give them a try.  They are really only worth firing when you get into a heads-on engagement.  There are plenty of times when the computer comes straight at you and that's when I fire.  Downside is I normally end up damaging myself unless I pull up almost immediately.  There is really no point at firing them from even the slightest range because all the computer has to do is turn <b>slightly </b> and the missiles veer off course.  I think that is what really destroys the whole &quot;fire and forget&quot; aspect that missiles should have.  The homing technology would have to be far less advanced than what we have today if the missiles can't even follow a target through one turn, or maybe I'm just missing something?
<br />
<br />Just one more thing I find annoying.  In just about every other game I play involving missiles or homing weapons there is a nice solid tone that tells me I have a lock.  I like to know when I have a lock.  All I have to say is once I find a pair of decent, low-energy consuming class 9 weapons my Cannonballs are going out the door.</div>

			<div class="content">I guess I am one of the few that does use missles and I have  had good success with them, right now my eagle has two BLUE BLAZEs. two THOR'S HAMMERs, and two sun stalkers. the sun stalkers have good homing and dont cost a whole lot and together do alot of hull damage. I mainly do head on runs cause I use afterburners alot and I fire enough to take down shields which is fast and then uncage missiles just before passing, the sun stalkers dont have so large of a blast that you get much damage if any and it almost allways hits the target. my only problem is that when they have just enough shields left so that it looks like there gone and the missiles hit all damage of one missile goes to the shields and is a waist. most of the time thats the only manuver I use the missiles in but sometimes launch them after a running opponent and turn away and they hit, I have never even noticed any sort of crosshair follow with the missiles.</div>

			<div class="content">I don't use missiles much.  They are a total waste of money.  They need to be fixed.  
<br />
<br />Heck, even the torpedo which I DO USE, needs help.  I always thought a torpedo was designed to delivery a MASSIVE payload onto a hard target, BUT NO, I get this little weeny pop against battleship hulls.  Still, they're fine for blasting a lot of smaller fighters when you're in a hurry.
<br />
<br />What were the dev's thinking when they added missiles to the gave?  I've never seen such lame missile weapons.  I don't see the point of popping off a pricey missile and see it go off somewhere and hit a rock or slam into a friendly freighter.  Ugh.  Same with seeking mines.  You know they could at least seek ENEMIES for crying out loud!!!!!
<br />
<br />Grrr, I swear seeking missiles and mines hit anything but the target you fired it at if they even bother to hit anything.
<br />
<br />Fire and Forget.  
<br />
<br />HAH!

			<div class="content">I only used a vollley of Lancer missles once and never again, they are hard to aim, expensive, (but the look freakin awesome <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) nonetheless fun when you wanna put a little wrinkle in your gameplay to make it last longer, but blasters are much better. I still find that if i clip on 2 missle launchers full of rockets, i have a lot of fun flying real close to a trade ship and missle-bombing it, its tons of fun <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. I use torpedos a lot in fighter combat (i agree, they look awesome on the sabre) ill take down his shield with my blasters, then, when im 90% sure it will hit i fire off a torpedo at him, then i fly like 2 inches from one side of his cockpit as the torpedo smashes into. Its quite fun really, and, i figure, since i dont need CD's (cruise disruptors) against npc ships. Why not just mount as much firepower as i can, since, i dont know about any of you, but i like a sort of All-Purpose ship <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> so its very self sufficient, very very good against fighters, and can just as easily take out stations and battleships. Defintly a vessel for me

			<div class="content">I wouldn't use missiles, other than disrupters and torps, even if they were better on the tracking. I'm a big fan of having to aim. Blowing money on missiles is, IMHO, a great way to keep fire-and-forget losers from killing the game.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />Reaper: $200,000,000. 
<br />Rockets: $100,000
<br />The look on that pilot's face when you launch a full pod of screamers up his tailpipe: priceless</div>
