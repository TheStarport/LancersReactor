<br />
<br />&quot;Okay, now twist to the left, push it up 45 degrees then pull!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Aha! He's using Linux!&quot;
<br />
<br />Apparently, there were a lot of people that Vader &quot;wanted to see with his own eyes.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;In a moment of weakness Vader was totally caught off-guard by the &quot;Nerd Gang.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry Lord Vader, but it doesn't look like you're cable-ready.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I have a bad feeling about this.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Hair Club for the Sith: I'm not only a Dark Lord, I'm also a client.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Skywalker chose the name &quot;Darth Vader&quot; mainly because &quot;Headwound Annie&quot; just didn't strike the same fear into the hearts of his foes.
<br />
<br />&quot;Can you hear me now? Good!&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Look Bob, if I press here his foot wiggles...!&quot; 
<br />
<br />All the Emperor's horses and all the Emperor's men couldn't put Darth Vader back together again. 
<br />
<br />Behind every great man are a dozen nerds. 
<br />
<br /><img src='http://www.starwars.com/community/captions/2003/05/img/caption98.jpg '>
<br />
<br />&quot;Whew! Chewie! Ever hear of a Tic-Tac?&quot; 
<br /> 
<br />Bo Shek realizes too late that his fellow barflies may not appreciate jokes about stupid Wookiees and senile Jedi. 
<br />
<br />&quot;You know, young man, when you say, 'I'd rather kiss a Wookiee,' you really need to take a look around you first.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, well at least in a twenty years my haircut will be in style again!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What's that boy? Timmy's stuck in the well?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;You call those sideburns?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Fuzzball? No one said Fuzzball!&quot;  
<br />
<br />The fur salesman was soon to discover that he had enquired at the wrong dwelling. Stormtroopers called to the scene later could only describe what they found as &quot;gruesome, yet humorous.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;He followed me home. Can I keep him?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I now pronounce you husband and Wookiee.&quot;  
<br />

<br />The Dunes of Hazzard
<br /> 
<br />SUNDAY!!! SUNDAY!! SUNDAY!! Come see the Jawas attempt to jump not one, but TWO Rebel cruisers!!  
<br />
<br />&quot;Quick, cue up 'Ride of the Valkyries!''  
<br />
<br />And that was the last time the Jawas were allowed to watch The Fast and the Furious.  
<br />
<br />&quot;KITT, turbo boost!&quot;  
<br />
<br />Tragically, the boy on the flying bike was never heard from again.  
<br />
<br />Cameron Fry didn't feel quite right about leaving his dad's sandcrawler at that parking garage.  
<br />
<br />Jawa eXtreme Off-Road! Coming soon from LucasArts to your home console! 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yee-haw! Uh, I mean Utinni!&quot;  
<br />
<br />Here he comes, here comes Speed Jawa, he's a demon on wheels... 
<br />
<br />Heh he, there&#180;s plenty more where that came from... <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />by JediPat
<br />
<br />Obi-Wan: So let me get this straight. You found the most dangerous man in the galaxy and you decided to make more of him?
<br />by Inebriated Wyrm
<br />
<br />Kaminoan: Yes. And given the hive mind mentality of the clones and the isolation of this facility, a single homicidal thought could do in this entire planet. ObiWan: Right, let me know how that goes
<br />by Inebriated Wyrm
<br />
<br />hey, aren't you the one that put that probe up my padawan 10 years ago?
<br />by empirestrikes

<br />&quot;Are you just going to leave your droid out there in the rain?&quot; &quot;I don't recall ever owning a droid.&quot;
<br />by Rin, Destroyer of Keyboards
<br />
<br />Obi-Wan: Do you validate parking?
<br />by Clutch D'Rofab
<br />
<br />Obi: &quot;Umm... you don't look like the description you gave me online.&quot;
<br />by Darth_Dave
<br />
<br />Obi-Wan: &quot;You've been waiting for me for the past ten years, and thought nothing of it?&quot; Taun We: &quot;Yes, we have remarkable patience. Though we gave up waiting for SWG to be released. Darn lazy devs.&quot;
