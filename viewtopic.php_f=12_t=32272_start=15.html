			<div class="content">cops in the UK do not ordinarily carry firearms, although tactical response and anti-terrorist units (SWAT to you) always do. however in reality esp in large urban centres, up to 40% of officers can be expected to carry firearms on a regular basis, esp in London.
<br />
<br />however as gun crime is far less than in the USA, even an armed police officer is highly unlikely to draw his firearm let alone use it, unless confronted by an armed offender. And most British people are still very wary of allowing our police to carry guns as an everyday occurence. Not only is the population gnerally proud of the fact that we maintain law and order without instantly resorting to the threat or the actual use of firearms, unlike most other countries, but also we don't entirley trust handing such responsibility over to &quot;bobbies&quot; and neither do the Police forces, who are generally happier with having trained units to deal with firearms.
<br />
<br />Several high-profile instances where inexperienced or ill-trained coppers have shot and killed people brought this issue into focus some years ago. Even the trained units make mistakes based on incorrect identification or bad intelligence, how much more so your local plod, especially the arrogant young ones who are full of the &quot;i am a copper and I'm really hard&quot; attitude? they'd pull out their guns straight away and shoot first , i guarantee it; so it's best things stay as they are, at least for us.
<br />
<br />we do have a tradition that the Police forces are essentially civilian; citizens in uniform, drawn from the local community, distinct from military forces imposed upon communities by central govt. This is derived from our history and our resentment of standing armies and rule by force (which of course we had once) 
<br />
<br />I still find the idea of Police with guns abhorrent, no matter where i go in the world.

			<div class="content">When an armed police officer over here shoots anyone, he is immediately suspended from service, and under full investigation to determine if it was a clean/good shooting. They could never do that if it was the whole police force! Imagine the amount of poeple/investigations!! It would be insanity. Accidents happen, but the determination is whether presented with the situation they thought there was a threat to public saftey etc. Police don't use guns unless crims do.............so knives/swords are fought with batons instead!</div>

			<h3><a href="#p296101" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">our foreign friends might be a bit surprised by the fact that officers get suspended for opening fire, Chips; but unf past history has shown that when armed police are given more freedom of action in this respect, some rather bad mistakes got made. remember the photographer who was gunned down in his mini because the cops got him mixed up with some terrorist (?)(IRA?) who drove a totally different car and looked totally different and was somewhere else at the time? and the kid who got shot in his bed in Birmingham? I was living in Birmingham at the time, not far away from Kings Heath where this shooting took place, I was in my final year at uni; bungled police raid on the wrong house, armed police burst in, held the parents at gunpoint, kid was upstairs, hiding under his bed covers cos he was scared by all the noise, copper went in and shot him dead - never even bothered to id his target.
<br />
<br />needless to say there was a furore and the W Midlands Police tried to hush it up, but the local community turned on the cops and virtually drove them out of Kings Heath for a while, and its not a rough ethnic minority area at all. In the end it went to court because the family wouldn't let the cops buy them off, as is what usually happens in complaints against the police that go to court. The then Chief Constable was made by the court to go on television at peak time news and publicly apologise to the family and take personal responsibilty for the incident.
<br />
<br />after that, the rules governing the conduct of armed officers changed, and became a lot stricter. Much as i don't like the police anyway, I'm satisfied that at the moment we've got the balance about right, and i would view any change to our firearms status quo as very disturbing and unwelcome.
<br />
<br />our american friends especially should realise that it is very difficult nigh on impossible for ordinary people in the UK to get firearms, due to strict firearms control. I have guns but I had to spend ages justifying why I wanted them and had to pull a few strings with local bigwigs who owed me favours so as to put some pressure on the cops, because its the rozzers who decide if you can have a firearms licence, and they come round and check the wepaons and storage regularly and i have to account for every weapon and every round of ammo.
<br />
<br />of course there are illegal firearns, stolen or reactivated, but unless you're a crimbo anyway you'll never even see one in all probability. 
<br />
<br />also any crime involving firearms, used or unused, will attract a very stiff sentence. 
<br />
<br />I was pleased to see much tougher gun laws in New York when I went there recently; isn't it so much safer to have proper gun laws? and i spk as a responsible licenced gun-owner.
<br />
<br />edit - I really must shut up, I''m obv bored at home and need to get back to work!

			<div class="content">yeh, but that was on the criminal side and resulted in the tightening of restrictions on ownership. what i was referring to was the tightening of police procedures. but you are right to point out an instance like Dunblane, where someone who'd been vetted by police went on a rampage. Hungerford also comes to mind, because that placed extremely tight restrictions on the ownership of automatic and semi-automatic weapons.</div>
