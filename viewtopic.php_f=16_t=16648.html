			<div class="content">For those interested in some background information on the various German location names throughout Rheinland, the following is what I collected. Maybe someone else privy to such information could also make a similar list for locations in Bretonia, Kusari, and Liberty.
<br />
<br />
<br />-System Dresden
<br />
<br />Dresden is a historic city of about half a million people in southeast Germany on the banks of the Elbe River. It's the capital of the federal state of Saxony, formerly the Kingdom of Saxony. It's famous for its old buildings and porcelain, and before the devastating bombing raids in 1945 used to be dubbed &quot;Florence of the North&quot;. It was founded as a city in 1206 AD.
<br />
<br />-Bautzen Station
<br />
<br />Bautzen is a 1000-year-old city in Saxony that has approx. 50,000 inhabitants. In East German times Bautzen was (in)famous for its large prison complex where dissidents of the East German regime were locked away. Near Bautzen is one of the largest brown coal mining fields in Central Europe.
<br />
<br />-Leipzig Station
<br />
<br />The biggest city of Saxony, Leipzig is a sprawling center of commerce. Founded almost 1000 years ago, some 600,000 people are living in Leipzig today. It was near Leipzig where Napoleon was defeated in 1813 AD.
<br />
<br />-Pirna Border Station
<br />
<br />Founded in 1233 AD, Pirna is another Saxon city half way between Dresden and the border to Bohemia in the Czech Republic. 43,000 people live in this scenic city in the Elbsandstein mountain range.
<br />
<br />-Vogtland Base 
<br />
<br />The Vogtland is a historic mountainous region in the southwest of Saxony at the border to Thuringia. The biggest city and capital of the Vogtland is Plauen.
<br />
<br />
<br />-System Frankfurt
<br />
<br />The biggest city of the federal state of Hesse and having the largest European airport, Frankfurt is home to some 600,000 people. A historic place in German history repeatedly, Frankfurt today is the banking and financial center of Germany and Europe. The European Central Bank (EC<img src=smilies/icon_smile_blackeye.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> is seated in Frankfurt.
<br />
<br />-Bruchsal Base
<br />
<br />Bruchsal is an over 1000-year old small city in the federal state of Baden-Wuertemburg close to the border to Hesse and the Rhine River.
<br />
<br />-Fulda Border Station
<br />
<br />Founded in 744 AD, the city of Fulda lies in the eastern part of Hesse near the borders to Thuringia and Bavaria.
<br />
<br />-Mainz Storage Facility
<br />
<br />Mainz is the capital of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate and is located on the Rhine River just opposite the city of Wiesbaden, the capital of Hesse. Founded by the Romans over 2000 years ago, Mainz is one of the oldest cities in Germany. Over the centuries Mains has been among the busiest trading centers in Central Europe.
<br />
<br />-Mannheim Station
<br />
<br />Mannheim was first mentioned in 744 AD. Located on the Rhine River, the city became a busy trading place with many corporations. Today Mannheim is the second largest city in Baden-Wuertemburg after its capital Stuttgart.
<br />
<br />-Planet Holstein
<br />
<br />Located just north of Hamburg and the Elbe River, Holstein is one of the stretches of land that today form the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein on the border to Denmark.
<br />
<br />
<br />-System Hamburg
<br />-Planet Hamburg
<br />
<br />With 2.1 million inhabitants Hamburg is the second largest city of Germany. Its international seaport extending along the Elbe River to the North Sea is among the largest in Europe.
<br />
<br />-Alster Shipyard
<br />
<br />The Alster River is the other river flowing through Hamburg and connects to the Elbe River.
<br />
<br />-Altona Station
<br />
<br />Originally a Danish rivaling settlement to Hamburg in southern Holstein, Altona later became a Prussian city with access to the Elbe River where several shipyards were erected. In 1949 AD Altona finally became one of seven districts in the city of Hamburg.
<br />
<br />-Battleship Westfalen
<br />
<br />Westfalen is the German name for the lands in the eastern parts of the federal state of Northrhine-Westphalia bordering Lower Saxony and Hesse.
<br />
<br />-Lubeck Border Station
<br />
<br />Formerly the capital of the Hanseatic League, L&#252;beck is located in Schleswig-Holstein on the Baltic Sea not far from the border to Denmark.
<br />
<br />-Vierlande Prison
<br />
<br />Vierlande is a stretch of marchland southeast of Hamburg near the Elbe River. The fertile marches allow for vegetables and flowers to be grown in abundance either in the open or in greenhouses. There is also an actual Vierlande Prison at the location of the old Nazi concentration camp Neuengamme.
<br />
<br />
<br />-System New Berlin
<br />-Planet New Berlin
<br />
<br />Founded in 1237 AD, Berlin today is the largest city and again capital of Germany. With over 4 million people before WWII, Berlin at one point used to be the fourth-largest city in the world. With all the destruction, the separation and the special status of the city after WWII, the city has yet to recuperate from these ill-effects. Yet it is well on its way to once again become a major trading hub between Eastern and Western Europe like in the Golden Twenties. Some 3.5 million people are currently living in Berlin.
<br />
<br />-Bonn Station
<br />
<br />Bonn is a compartively small city on the Rhine River in Rhineland-Westphalia. During 1949 AD and 1990 AD it served as the capital and seat of government for West Germany.
<br />
<br />-Brandenburg Border Station
<br />
<br />Formerly, a province in the heart of Prussia, Brandenburg today is a federal state surrounding the city of Berlin. Its capital is Potsdam.
<br />
<br />-Dortmund Station
<br />
<br />Dortmund is a medium-sized city near the Rhine River in Northrhine-Westphalia.
<br />
<br />-Essen Station
<br />
<br />One of the industrial centers of the Ruhrgebiet, the city of Essen is located in Northrhine-Westphalia. It's home to such large corporations as Krupp and Thyssen.
<br />
<br />-Kreuzberg Depot
<br />
<br />Kreuzberg is one of Berlin's central districts. During the separation of Berlin, Kreuzberg -- because of its location right at the Berlin Wall -- had become a less favorable district to live in. Foreigners (mainly Turks) and semi-outlaws moved there and have made it a &quot;tradition&quot; to riot in the streets there on May 1 every year.
<br />
<br />-Oder Shipyard
<br />
<br />The Oder River forms part of today's border between Germany and Poland.
<br />
<br />-The Ring
<br />
<br />There probably is no connection, but the Autobahn ring around Berlin is also called The Ring.</div>

			<div class="content">Thanks for the &quot;great&quot; comments.
<br />
<br />Over what period of time I wrote this (designing and skinning a new model sure takes longer) and why (maybe I just got sick of clueless people butchering the names for the umptieth time) does not really need to concern you. If you're not interested in this background information, then be so kind and simply skip this thread. Much obliged.</div>

			<div class="content">For the naysayers, I would just like to point out that the title of this topic was &quot;For those interested...&quot;  If you weren't interested, you shouldn't have clicked.
<br />
<br />I thought it was interesting.  I've never been to Europe, but I was in Japan for 2 years and I did find myself trying to find the correlation between the names chosen for the bases in Kusari and the real locations.
<br />
