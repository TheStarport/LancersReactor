			<div class="content">The convoy was not anywhere near your battle with the RH ships!
<br />Only BHG and GMG ships escort our SF convoys!
<br />Do you think that you can stand up to my fleet?  
<br />Have you taken a look at the numbers recently?
<br />I can field over 1000 capital ships, and over 100000 fighters to fight you!
<br />If I wanted to, I could crush you with the push of a button.
<br />So don't piss me off, or you will be thoroughly eliminated!
<br />
<br />
<br />Guild leader ww2jacob sat in front of a marvel of intelligece work.  A huge table, with a through map of all the systems in Sirius.  At the push of a button, he could zoom in to any given place, and have a shot of exactly what was happening there.  It was all thanks to his Recon Ships.  Several of them in every system, with dozens of controllers here at Athens, and he could watch exactly what was going on anywhere in the sector.  He reached out his hand, and touched a dot on the map.
<br />Words came up above the dot.
<br />&quot;System: Omicron Gamma.  Acessing Camera #365.&quot;
<br />A shot of a peaceful nebula in Omicron Gamma took the place of the map.  All of a sudden, a Warship jumped into the system.  In seconds, hundreds more followed.  Fighters came with them, and larger Warships.  A fleet with over a million men and over three thousand ships appeared before him.  The BHG Grand Fleet was ready for action.  A smile formed on ww2jacob's face.
<br />
<br />(Don't even think about 'finding' one of the Recon ships, they self-destruct if another ship gets within 1K of them.  Cloaked, or not.)

			<div class="content">Sorry ww2jacob, I had study and lecturing at changed times, and was not able to help with your fleet attack. The Kusari Police have been fortifying the Shikoku system against a rouge incursion and have already arrested several rogue ships trying to enter the Shikoku system on recon missions. The rogues will rot forever in the depths of Fuchu. And don't even <i>think </i> about attacking in Kusari territory. <b>NEVER </b>, I repeat <b>NEVER </b> will Pirates defeat a house. You will be met with the full force of the Kusari Naval war machine. I, Governer Ota, as a direct liason from the Emperor to the other houses and representitives will personally oversee a naval screening of the Cortez system to find this jumphole and blockade it. Kusari military envoys have been sent to Ames to discuss the temporary stationing of Kusari Police peacekeeping and riot forces in order to guard Kusari interests in the dark matter systems. Don't even try to threaten Rheinland. They are currently taking on the most powerful enemy in the RPG and could easily crush you The Kusari Empire is dedicated to stopping the spread of Sirius Pirates, from significant threats such as the HA to mere annoyances like the Rogues.
<br />
<br />OOC: This is getting out of hand. Suddenly the Liberty Rogues have the power to take on Liberty!? That's comparable to the Taliban rising up and seriously threatening the U.S....Not likely to happen. I don't think it will be accepted to consider the Rogues as powerful enough to take on another house that has a huge war machine for several months. Also, this is just a thought but maybe we should stop corporations discovering systems for themselves.</div>

			<div class="content">OOC:About crossovers. I got the &quot;Command Carrier&quot; name from Farscape
<br />
<br />LIBERTY TAKES OVER NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS:
<br />Today Liberty Navy High Command announced a plan to take over and annex independent systems
<br />neighboring Liberty Space. Because Cortez has already been overtaken, and Kepler under Alliance
<br />control, remaining systems to be overtaken are Bering, Hudson, Magellan and Galileo.
<br />Liberty Navy ships have moved in to these systems and Liberty has declared these systems to be
<br />&quot;under protection&quot; by liberty military. The Navy High Command has justified these actions by
<br />saying that it will attempt to create aditional security around Liberty core systems. 
<br />
<br />NEW SYSTEM DISCOVERED.
<br />Today Liberty Navy exploration teams discovered yet another new system. The new system is located
<br />between Colorado and Tau-29, and the Barrier extends to the system, covering about 25% of the system
<br />with ice asteroids. The system was first spotted by long range space telescope Discoverer 850, located
<br />on the orbit of planet Denver. After discovery of the system, an exploration team was sent to the system.
<br />Explorations are continuing in the system. So far five planets have been found in the system, two of them
<br />deemed suitable for colonization. One of the remaining planets is athmosphereless, rocky and hot planet
<br />unfit for any life, and the other two are of gaseous form. The system has been decided to be named Alabama
<br />system and the planets Atlanta, New Orleans, Savannah, Jackson and Montgomery.
<br />
<br />LIBERTY NAVY DECLARES SELF-SUFFICIENCE IN JUMPGATE TECHNOLOGY.
<br />Due to recent technological advancements, Liberty Navy is now self-sufficient when it comes to
<br />system-to-system travelling. The Navy is no longer dependent of Ageira and Jump Gate technology, because
<br />it has developed a new system that will make Jump Gates obsolete. Navy research scientists have developed
<br />a jump drive system which creates an artificial jump hole for a short time, enabling a ship or an group of
<br />ships to travel long distances in few seconds. The advantage of jump drives compared to the jump gates is
<br />that with jump drives ships are not dependent on permanent structures such as the jump gates. Howewer, the
<br />technology requires precise computer technology to avoid mishaps such as the infamous Dallas Incident. All
<br />more detailed information regarding Jump Drive technology is TOP SECRET.
<br />LIBERTY NAVY RESEARCH COMMAND. SECRET REPORT(OOC for you guys)
<br />TO:All fleet commanders and the supreme commander of Liberty Navy.
<br />In case of Jump Drive technology falling to the wrong hands, the Navy Research Command has developed a
<br />jump hole destabilizer device as a backup measure. The system disturbs jump holes making them unstable
<br />and unable to be used for travelling, while not destroying the jump holes. With the technology jump
<br />holes can be &quot;locked up&quot; and opened later. This technology can be applied also to artificial jump holes
<br />created by jump drives.</div>

			<div class="content">Official response to Rogues offer:
<br />
<br />Both Liberty and Kusari are members of the Axis along with ourselves. House Hispania is a friend of Bretonia.
<br />
<br />We have pulled our forces from the Axis/Hispanic war due to the weak position we are in and because we want an end to this war. Many lives are being lost due to this conflict.
<br />
<br />Whilst we consider your offer to be in the best intrest of the Rogues and very kind, we cannot accept. Our goal is for all houses of Sirius to live together in peace. A declartion of war by us against Liberty and Kusari, our allies, along with House Hispania, would not be in the best interest of Bretonia. 
<br />
<br />Any attack against Liberty, Kusari, Hispania, the other Axis corporations and especially Ageira Technologies, will not go down well with us. We are no longer a vengeful house but we are fiercly loyal to Ageira for sharing our goals and dreams. If they consider you a friend, then so will we, but, like everyone else you will not recieve any military aid from us.    
<br />
<br />To Ageira:
<br />
<br />thank you for the use of your terraforming technology. Research on planet Ipswich is almost complete. We will let you know when we are ready.</div>

<br />
<br />We accept the alliance however we are not yet ready to engage in open war. Like you we wish to see the glory days of not just Liberty but all the houses restored, a return to the days before corruption and prejudice split us apart. As a result we propose slightly different terms. We will supply you, as well as any other group who is willing to join our cause, with resources and technology we discover in return for assistance in upgrading and incresing our aging ships. We can work out exact terms if you accept but the basic premise is that we help each other by doing what we each do best.</div>

			<div class="content">OOC:Arillas if you dont use PROMETHEUS soon there will be no more war.
<br />Noy ladies and gentelmen i give you the moment you've all been waiting for:
<br />
<br />CFJ Hellfire:
<br />
<br />Commander Rodregouz was worried, this new technology had been his idea so if he screwed up it would be his head on the end of a pike.
<br />
<br />His Juggernaught placed a small object in the nebula of the uncharted iota 9 system and few out at top speed
<br />
<br />&quot;Bring jump drive online&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Aye sir&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Commander detonation in 60 seconds&quot;
<br />
<br />The Hellfire mad an in-system jump to far out in space. The cameras turned aft ready for the show of a liftime, he hoped.
<br />
<br />Inside the nebula the device used the same principle as the outcast GOD class cruisers to start a detination of the gas. This was amplifed by corsair tech to cause the gas not only to ignight but explode as well.
<br />
<br />The commander watched as the inferno of a nebula expanded to twice its size before inploding and sending out a shock wave that shook the hellfire.
<br />
<br />Good it had worked the alliance could now detonate nebulas, and with a few modifications ignite atmospheres. The ultimate goal was for this tech to be modifyed to detonate the hydrogen in a star. This would mean the alliance would finaly have an edge.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir the prototypes you asked for&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you luitenent&quot;
<br />
<br />Rodregouz looked at the plans. The tech could be installled into large missiles the size of a liberty rino. These would be equiped with the newly developed sunbspace jump drive and could jump anywhere they wanted. This would help the alliance by doing much more than just destroying there enemis. It would take out the axis's achilles heal, it would destroy there sorce of super fuel and once more the allience would be able to beat the axis
<br />
<br />&quot;Set a course for New Madrid ensign&quot;
<br />
<br />A figure towards the back of the room moved fowards and sent a simple message to the wepon builders on New Madirid
<br />&quot;Build as 5 for every planet and nebila in axis controlled space&quot;
<br />The war had entered a new phase.............
<br />
<br />
<br />OOC:I'll post all mine and outcasts tech and ships on the other thread

			<div class="content">(First, in the interest of preventing the deteriation of strategy from the use of Jump Drives, I am proposing a way to regulate them:
<br />
<br />The following rules apply to using any form of long-range Jump device (Rift Drive, Jumpdrive, or Mercury Star Drive): Due to dissipation of Jump energy at long range, Jump Drives will not allow you to make an instant Jump between, say, New Berlin and New Madrid. Although such a Jump is possible, it is excesively dangerous and will, ninety-nine point (insert a lot of nines here) percent of the time, result in the Jumping ship being lost to Deep Space. &quot;Safe&quot; Jumps are those of more or less the same range as an original Jump Gate; the advantage over Jump Gates is:
<br />
<br />1. You don't have to pay me for any drive other than the Mercury
<br />2. Jump Drives cannot be destroyed
<br />3. You can attempt long-range Jumps, though at great risk.
<br />
<br />I'm going to post more detailed rules later; for now, you just accept that you can't simply Jump past borders)
<br />
<br />(In addition, I would like to add my opinion on new player power levels and corporations discovering systems. The power level for this rp is already pretty high (I direct your attention, again, to Rheinland's 1400 warships) so any new player coming in with no force is going to be pretty far behind the rest. The rogues have been unaccounted for for a while, so nobody really knows what they've been up to. They've had plenty of time to come up with a fleet.
<br />
<br />There is absolutely no problem with a corporation discovering a new system. If you have a ship and a Jump Drive, you can explore the fringes of the sector. Simple.)
<br />
<br />Announcement: Ageira executives have announced plans to finally update the Ageira Technologies Locational Aid to Systems (A.T.L.A.S.), the system map database currently in use. With the update to ATLAS, all factions will have access to an up-to-date systems map. We ask the people of Sirius to assist us in this venture by sending in the approximate locations of their systems, relative to the original systems on the map.
<br />
<br />(Translated: I'm going to make a map of the current explored space. I want to know where all the new systems are, roughly speaking, so that I can ensure I get it right.)</div>

			<div class="content">OOC: well i have only one new system: New madrid its half way between alpha and gamma on the far reaches of the right hand side of sirrius.
<br />you can include iota 9 if you want but i dont think anyone will want to go there
<br />
<br />Also(as i will soon post i just dont have the time right now for another long post)
<br />my subpase drives can go long diatances. They use a lagre ammount of enerygy to vibrate the ship through subspace frequences until it reaches the correct one where by it tears a hole into subspace. Once hear it requires no energy to remain so it can jump for as long as it wants. The downside to theese drives is that it takes 2 mins for them to charge and 1 min to get to the right frequancey so useing them to escap battles is not advisable. Also the drives design allows of in-system jumps so i can move forces rapidly in system
<br />
<br />I will post my fleet when i have a responce from the axis
<br />
<br />Message to Axis:
<br />We now have several of these wepons ready we will fire them unless you withdraw from our systems. We will then give you a limited amount of time (2 real days) to decide wether or not you want to surrender or not if not  this is your fate *Iota 9 incdent plays*</div>

			<div class="content">***Cambridge Scientists to modify Hispanic Jump Hole Disruptors***
<br />
<br />We have had reports that the excellent research scientists have entered into preliminary development in to a system Jump Hole destabilizer. Reports indicate that a weapons platform will be modified to send a pulse on the detection of a jump hole to close it when the wave hits it. The plan is to have one of the modded platforms through out Bretonian space. Whilst the wave is automatic, an overide to manual will be possible, but only the king will know the code. This is major step forward in the defence of Bretonia.
<br />
<br />In other news, Bretonia has discovered over 100000 new species of plant on planet Ipswich. Origianlly, Ageira technologies had been on stand by to terraform the Planet, but these new plants make the atmosphere stable enough to warrant life. It is not expected that all the Leeds citizens will be transferred to this new planet, as talks between the Bretonian government and the Cambridge scientists has been going well as to the habitation of Planet Gaia. This will no doubt upset the Gaians, but the king is prepared to meet any hostility by them with full force of our navy should they resort to terrorism. 
<br />
<br />Some of the plants discovered on Ipswich for further study, as hopes increase there could be cures to many illnesses within in them. We will bring you more on this when official information is released by the Monarchy.
<br />
<br />To Ageira - Thank you for being on stand by with your terraforming ships. As we have wasted your precious time, Bretonia will pay you to carry out work on the new system with regards to jump gates and trade lanes. We hope this is good compensation.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just read your post DSQrn. Why are you pulling out?
