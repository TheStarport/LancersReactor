			<div class="content">Hey guys, sorry for the long wait but I have been busy and tired as hell lately. I have spent the last few hours working on the next part. I will try my best to post chapters up regulairly, but as of right now there are no promises. Since I have not written in a little while, don't be suprized if there are a few mistakes. And if some of the dialoge seems a little weak, just remember that it is better than me keeping you waiting. 
<br />
<br />And now without further ado, I present Project Revolution, Chapta Fo!
<br />
<br />Project: Revolution Chapter 4
<br />
<br />&#8220;All units, fire at will!&#8221; The escort leader screamed into his microphone. The wing began to fire on the incoming ships, but their shield health and hull strength bar only showed signs of minor damage.
<br />
<br />When the escort ship&#8217;s battery had to recharge, even when it was just for a second, the mysterious ship&#8217;s shields were back at full capacity before the escort could fire on them again.
<br />
<br />Finally, they were close enough for the transport to identify them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell? Are those Rheinland ships?&#8221; Trent asked the man sitting beside him. 
<br />
<br />The man sitting next to him did not answer. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey, did you hear me? Those are Rheinland ships, what the hell is going on?&#8221; He was now wondering if the man could really even hear him anymore.
<br />
<br />Trent looked at the man sitting next to him and saw him with his right hand in the leg pocket of his uniform. He looked, trying to figure out what the man had in his pocket. What he saw next intrigued him further. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey, what the hell is that?&#8221; Trent asked. 
<br />
<br />The man answered by pulling a shock pistol out of his pocket, put his finger around the trigger and touched it to Trent&#8217;s arm.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh hell no. What do you think you&#8217;re doing, have you lost your min-&#8220; 
<br />
<br />Before he could finish, there was a very powerful shock in his left arm. The pain quickly spread through his entire body. His head went black and he could feel himself fall out of his chair and onto the corpse laying a couple of feet away.
<br />
<br />He tried to open his eyes but he couldn&#8217;t, he couldn&#8217;t even move. He lay there for a few seconds, he saw the faces of Juni and King, and then was unconscious. 
<br />
<br />************************************************************************
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are you sure he&#8217;s the one, I want no slip-ups.&#8221; A voice echoed in his head. It had a kind of soft sound to it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, General McMullen. I made sure, I had to bust him out of a Liberty prison transport in Alaska but he is in one piece. Those Order fools are so easy to trick, I was practically pulling him by the strings.&#8221; Another voice said.
<br />
<br />Now his hearing was clearer and he could understand what the people were saying better. 
<br />
<br />Then he remembered what had happened on the ship. He tried to open his eyes but realized he had something over his face. He tried to reach up and feel what was tied to him but his efforts were in vain. It was then that he felt he was tied to a table, his arms and legs bound.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ah, I think our little guest is awake. It&#8217;s about time.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Now could hear a man&#8217;s voice, with a slight Rheinland accent. It was soft and did not sound threatening. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Take off his blindfold, let him at least see where he is, as now he probably won&#8217;t be leaving for a good while.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; The other man said.
<br />
<br />Trent felt someone lift his head up and untie the blindfold. As soon as it came off a bright light nearly blinded him. He slammed his eyes shut.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mister Trent, it appears that you are part of a dangerous terrorist organization known in the colonies as The Order, is this true or will we have to, say &#8216;convince&#8217; you to tell us?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />When Trent opened his eyes, he could make out a light skinned man, with jet-black hair that came down to about his ears and hung straight down his face. He did not appear threatening, but Trent wanted to really watch what he said this time.
<br />
<br />&#8220;If you do not answer me very soon I will take that as a no.&#8221; He said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hum, it appears we will have to use more, persuasive methods. Doctor, will you bring me the serum?&#8221; He asked, not showing any emotion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Of course general, right away.&#8221; Said a female doctor. Make that a very attractive female doctor, Trent thought to himself.
<br />
<br />As she was walking out of the room, a door opened in front of her. And in stepped a very large, muscular man with short gray hair. He glared at her, and then gave an almost evil grin.
<br /> 
<br />&#8220;And just where do you think you&#8217;re going Miss Megumi?&#8221; The man said in a deep, scratchy voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s it to you Colonel? I&#8217;m just going to get the serum so the interrogation can get started.&#8221; She glared back.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Humph, still easy-going with your interrogations, eh General McMullen?&#8221; He smiled slightly, and then looked back at the doctor.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Miss Megumi, I- oh sorry, Doctor Megumi.&#8221; He said sarcastically.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Doctor  Megumi, I suggest that you forget the serum and lay down some towels instead, this could get messy.&#8221; He said, then glared at Trent.
<br />
<br />Oh hell, what have I gotten myself into now? Trent thought to himself.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Colonel Raikov, please don&#8217;t resort to your brutal interrogation methods, I would like to prove that we can handle this without the use of violence.&#8221; The General said.
<br />
<br />The big man just laughed. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;If I don&#8217;t use violence, then I don&#8217;t get to have any fun. Besides, drugs don&#8217;t make people talk, pain does.&#8221; He said crossing his arms across his chest. 
<br />
<br />It was then that Trent noticed how well built the Colonel was. He was at least eight feet tall with arms that looked like they could punch through the hull of a battleship. His hair was short and gray and he wore an olive-green uniform.
<br />
<br />&#8220;W-where am I?&#8221; Trent asked weakly. 
<br />
<br />He then noticed the man who had been on the ship with him, the one who had knocked him out, standing with his back facing him.   
<br />
<br />&#8220;Colonel Raikov, I believe you mentioned something about a very large payment for bringing Mister Trent in? Can I be expecting the two million credits all at once?&#8221; He said, and then it hit Trent like a tone of bricks. 
<br />
<br />He had been betrayed. Cheated and handed over for some money, and he then made up his mind that he would never trust anyone again that he hadn&#8217;t known for a long time.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You can expect that two million credits over my lifeless corpse you low-down scoundrel.&#8221; The Colonel said harshly. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;But- but Colonel Raikov, you promised me payment if I brought him in.&#8221; The man said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t want our new friend listening in, we will discuss this after I have dealt with him personally.&#8221;
<br />
<br />He walked over to where Trent was tied down and punched him in the forehead. He shut his eyes immediately; he could feel the throbbing pain in his head. It hurt so badly.
<br />
<br />And he even held back, that wasn&#8217;t even a quarter of his strength, he thought to himself before he fell unconscious.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />LOL, bet some of you weren't expecting what just happened? This is a fanfic so all comments are welcome, please be bruitally honest with me. And again I apologize for such the long wait.

			<div class="content">Oh sorry, I haven't played Starlancer other that the demo. Colonel Raikov was in Metal Gear Solid 3, remember? Major Ivan RAIDENovich Raikov. As for the Colonel in my story, I hope you don't mind but I decided to use Colonel Volgin because I thought he was kind of cool. I thought it would be way too easy to figure outif I used Colonel Volgin so I changed his name to Colonel Ivan Raikov.
<br />
<br />BTW, I haven't had much time to work on chapter five lately, but I only have four more days of school then I'm out for six weeks.</div>

			<div class="content">@Neuro- yes. When you stand on your head and gargle Asprin and as long as bret doesn't rub anything in my face for being lazy then I will try to get the next chapter up as soon as I can.
<br />
<br />Let me go ahead and tell you. This break has not been 100% laziness, I needed some time to think of new ideas. Some parts of the preview I posted a little while back remain the same, but about half of the stuff is bound to change. I won't tell you what as it might spoil something, but within the next few chapters you will be able to figure it out.
<br />
<br />Sorry for the edit, but I just had to say. If the next one or maybe two chapters seem a little corny, I apologize. I am just trying to set the stage for all of those &quot;major events&quot; I mentioned in the preview.
<br />
<br />Why is it that whenever I try to post a picture as part of a post or my sig, it never works?

			<div class="content">Guys, as much as I hate to break the news, it may be a long time before I can finish. My aunt is in very bad shape, and has been asleep for thirteen days straight in a hospis. She isn't going to live much longer. I don't have much time as of writing this before I have to go, so I will try to keep it brief.
<br />
<br />About four months ago, she got very sick. She was rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night. She has been confined to a wheelchair, and about three years ago, could not leave her bed anymore. The doctors think that her intestins are beginning to rot, literially. She has been laying in the same position for so long that blood is starting to pool in her stomach and lungs. For the past three weeks, she has been living at the hospis. It's inivetable that she will not make it much longer, and so, I can not concentrate on my writing at all. It may be a very long time before I will be able to devote any of my time to Project Revoluion. The doctors say it may only be a matter of days before she passes away, or it could be weeks or even months, they just don't know. And even after it happens, it will still take a very long time to clear my head about all this. I may be able to come to TLR on Off Topic a little, and read some fanfics, but I will not be able to work on mine and make it any good. It will be rushed, poorly put together, not very clear as to what is happening if I contiue now. I am sorry that I cannot do this anytime soon, but stuff like this takes time. If anyone else out there thinks they can contiue my story to help some people with the withdrawls they have been having, then you have my full permission. But when I do return, I will probibaly start right where I left off. 
<br />
<br />I have to go now, I am sorry. I will be back as soon as I can. Hope to be back soon.
<br />For a while, this may be my last post here at TLR, although I may have a couple of very short posts every now and then, this is probibaly the last one I can actually dedicate some time and thought to. I will come back every now and then to check up on everyone, but as for now, this is goodbye to TLR. Please pray for my aunt, ask for her to have peace and no longer feel pain. I have to go now, so as the last thing I say, goodbye to all, and help keep TLR thriving.</div>

			<div class="content">Hey guys, I'm still here. 
<br />
<br />My aunt passed away at about three o'clock this morning. To me, this is a blessing in desguise. As sad is it is, she is no longer in pain or suffering, and this has taken a load off of my grandmother and great-grandmother. They would go to the hospis and stay there every day with her all day. It wore both of them out, and they spent the night at the hospital with her a few times. About a week ago, they started only going up to the hospis to see her for a little while, and were gone for no more than an hour. Now, all that needs to be taken care of are the insurance and the funieral. (I'm sorry if I didn't spell that right, but with all the excitement at three o'clock this morning, I am exhausted.) 
<br />
<br />I plan to begin work on my story again in a little while, after my head has been cleared. But right now, I'm going back to bed. It appears that my absence from TLR will not be as long as I had thought at first, I'll be back soon.</div>
