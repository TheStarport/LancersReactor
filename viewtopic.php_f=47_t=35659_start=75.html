			<div class="content">Here is chapter 13. Sorry about the 6 month wait.
<br />
<br />CHAPTER 13: Stranded
<br />
<br />	Trent crawled from the cockpit cursing his luck and his dislocated shoulder. He banged the injured shoulder against the hard plexiglass of the cockpit and yelped in pain as the joint popped back into place. It hurt like hell, but at least he could move it again.
<br />
<br />	He held his hand over his eyes and scanned the area. The Anubis had crashed into an area that was mostly sand, which had prevented the breakup of the cockpit and thereby sparing Trent's life. The rest of the ship was spread out in a debris trail that stretched for many meters into the distance. Smoke from burning fuel rose high into the air, and Trent realized he needed to get as far from the wreck as possible in case the wackos from the Covenant were searching for him. He climbed back into the cockpit and retrieved a survival pack which contained a first aid kit, rations, a blaster pistol and a location transmitter. Trent opened up the first aid kit, grabbed a painkiller hypo-syringe and injected himself. The throbbing pain in his arm eased, and he threw the syringe back in the pack. He grabbed the location transmitter and put it in his jacket pocket.
<br />
<br />	Trent turned and began to make his way toward some rocky hills when he remembered that he had picked up an escape pod before the crash. He looked over the wreckage without much hope. The hull of the Anubis had pretty much been torn to pieces on impact, and it would be a miracle if anything survived the impact. 
<br />
<br />	He stopped. Off in the distance, something glittered in the dim sunlight. 
<br />
<br />	Cockpit glass.
<br />
<br />	Trent ran over to the escape pod, amazed that it had survived at all. It was in pretty sorry shape, but was mostly intact. Trent tried to open the pod with his hands, but it was jammed shut. He found a piece of metal to use as a lever and began to pry open the pod. After several minutes of effort, the pod swung open.
<br />
<br />	Juni was alive, but unconscious. She was bleeding from a head wound, but it looked to be superficial. Trent opened his first aid kit and dressed the wound as best he could. He had no idea why he was doing this, as not more than fifteen minutes ago she had tried to kill him, but she had been a friend, and was someone he had once loved. 
<br />
<br />	Other than the head wound, Juni didn't seem to have any other serious injuries, so Trent decided it was safe to move her. He slung the survival pack over his shoulder and picked up Juni. His injured shoulder ached in protest, but he carried her toward the hills in the distance.
<br />
<br />--------------------
<br />
<br />	The cavern reached five meters into the hillside, and Trent figured that this was as good a place as any to hide out for a while. The hike had taken nearly an hour, and he was near exhaustion. He gently laid Juni down and collapsed on the other side of the cave. Next he took out a small lantern and turned it on, illuminating the cave with a soft glow. He then pulled out the blaster pistol, keeping it close by in case trouble showed up.
<br />
<br />	He leaned back against the cave wall, closed his eyes and let his thoughts wander. How could Juni, he wondered to himself, sink so low as to betray all those she knew? Then again, he wasn't exactly one who could pass judgment in that regard...
<br />
<br />	Trent woke with a start. How long had he been asleep? He checked his chronograph and cursed as he saw  he had been out for nearly three hours. He looked around and saw that Juni was gone, and she had taken the blaster pistol and survival pack with her. Fortunately, she had not bothered to search him and as a result had not found the location transmitter. Trent knew that his best chance of survival now was that transmitter.
<br />
<br />	He fished in his jacket pocket and pulled out the device. He knew that if he activated it, the Covenant might reach him before the Order did, and considering what he had just done to several of their agents, the welcome he would receive if they found him first was not one he wanted.
<br />
<br />	He had no choice. He activated the device and looked up into the sky wondering who would reach him first.
<br />
<br />Mmmm...Synth Paste...</div>

No offence Neuro, I'm not trying to compete with you, but there are a lot of people who are just dying for me to finish mine. And now that I have a clear head, I can contiue where I left off, maybe sometime this weekend.
<br />
<br />Sorry if I got a little off topic, but this is amazing. I don't have any thing to say other than WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!? You almost killed me with the suspence. But  as far as the story goes, unbelievable. That's all I can say, just unbelievable. Keep up the good work.

			<div class="content">And now, here's chapter 14, served piping hot with a side of Au Jus.
<br />
<br />CHAPTER 14: Rescue...?
<br />
<br />	The roar of spacecraft over head jolted Trent out of a sound sleep. He jumped up and looked out of the cave to see several craft landing near the wreckage of his fighter. At this distance he could not tell what kind of ships they were and therefore had no idea if these were his rescuers or soon-to-be captors.
<br />
<br />	Trent decided, for better or for worse, that he would have to get a closer look at the arrivals before he knew whether he was rescued, or whether he was toast. He set off toward the wreckage, taking cover behind the occasional boulder. He stopped behind a large outcropping of igneous rock about a hundred meters from where the ships had landed and took a look. His heart sank as he saw the symbols on the Anubis fighters and realized they were not Order ships. He cursed his luck, realizing that he was unarmed.
<br />
<br />	There was only one option left, Trent thought to himself, and that was to try to get back to the cave, hide there and hope the Order showed up before the Covenant found him. He turned around and slowly started back, keeping low and moving as quietly as he could. He had moved about a hundred meters when one of the Covenant agents noticed him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Look! There's someone up there!&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's Trent! Get him!&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent cursed and ran. Blaster fire erupted around him as the energy bolts vaporized the rock and sand around him. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hold it right there!&quot; one of the agents called out behind him.
<br />
<br />	Trent jumped behind a rocky outcropping and suddenly stopped short. He found himself facing the business end of a blaster pistol wielded by Juni. He slowly raised his hands in defeat. It was all over. The Covenant had him, and he was sure what they were going to do with him was not going to be pleasant. 
<br />
<br />	Juni looked at him icily.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You're going to enjoy every second of this, aren't you?&quot; Trent asked testily.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Is that what you think this is about? Personal vendettas? This goes way beyond my feelings for you, Trent. This is about the future of humanity in Sirius!&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent shook his head. He knew he couldn't convince her otherwise.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I am grateful you didn't kill me, &quot; Juni said, feeling the bandage Trent had applied.
<br />
<br />	Trent said nothing. What was there to say?
<br />
<br />	Two Covenant agents came aroud from the other side of the rock.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Colonel Zane? Are you all right?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm fine. Take Mr. Trent into custody.&quot;
<br />
<br />	One of the agents nodded and motioned for Trent to move. Trent shrugged and moved. The agent smashed the butt of his blaster pistol into the back of Trent's head, and he fell to the ground, stunned but still conscious. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;That's enough!&quot; Juni said.
<br />
<br />	The two agents grabbed Trent and pulled him back to his feet. 
<br />
<br />	From out of nowhere spacecraft roared overhead. Trent looked up and saw three bat-shaped ships fly over the wreckage, and instantly knew they were not human. He also saw his chance to escape. He knocked the blaster out of a distracted Juni's hands, turned around and shot the Covenant agents. They collapsed to the ground. He whirled around to face Juni, who had a shocked expression on her face. They faced each other for what seemed an eternity. Trent finally turned and ran back in the direction of the caves. Above him, the alien craft began to engage the Covenant fighters as they took off.
<br />
<br />	As Trent ran, a faint ethereal voice sounded in his mind:
<br />
<br />	&quot;Do not run...&quot;
<br />
<br />	He felt dizzy, and his strength failed him entirely. He fell to the sand and lost consciousness.
<br />
<br />
<br />	
<br />	
<br />
<br />Mmmm...Synth Paste...</div>

			<div class="content">Here's Chapter 15. Hope you like it.
<br />
<br />------------
<br />
<br />Chapter 15: Communion
<br />
<br />	Darkness. Silence.
<br />
<br />	He did not know where he was, or even if he was dead or alive, for he could not even see his own body. Thick darkness surrounded him, and he could only assume that he was definitely not among the living.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hello?&quot; he called out into the void. His voice echoed around him.
<br />
<br />	Well, he thought to himself, this must be it. The afterlife. What an exciting 
<br />place.
<br />	
<br />	&quot;Where am I?&quot; he called out again, and realized that this was probably a stupid thing to do, because it was highly doubtful that anyone was around to hear him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Do not be alarmed. You will come to no harm,&quot; a voice said from out of the darkness.
<br />
<br />	Trent felt a shiver run down his nonexistent spine. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;It was not easy for us to communicate with your mind,&quot; the voice continued.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Who are you?&quot; Trent asked.
<br />
<br />	An image of a tall slender creature appeared before him. It was roughly humanoid in appearance, except for the insectlike head and six limbs. Trent recognized the figure as the one who had haunted his dreams.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Is it not clear to you?&quot; the voice replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You're the Dom'Kavash, arent't you?&quot; 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Where am I?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You are still on the planet below. We are communicating through the medium of thought.&quot;
<br />
<br />	 &quot;So it was you who was giving me the visions and dreams?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes. It was a difficult task for us to breach the barriers to your mind. Your species is not accustomed to telepathic contact. Do not fear, you are safe, as is the female that was with you.&quot; 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Juni? Where is she?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;She is safe.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;'Safe' as in not dead?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have not harmed her. She will be returned to her people.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Just like that? You do know she and her people attacked you, right?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Their actions are irrelevant.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What does that mean?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Patience. All will become clear to you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wait a second, I want to know why you let her go.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It is clear to us that you posess a great deal of compassion for the one you call Juni. This is a rare trait, even among our own people, and especially rare among those whom one would call their enemy. You might conclude that it is your compassion for the female that has spared her life.&quot;
<br />
<br />	This was all unnerving to Trent. &quot;How do you know all this?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Dom'Kavash posess abilities beyond your understanding that we choose not to reveal. We have chosen to spare her life, and shall leave it at that. As for you, know that you are safe and will not be harmed. We have need of you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;
<br />
<br />	There was silence for a moment. &quot;We seek your help.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;My help?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It would seem that we have a common enemy, would it not?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Nomads?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, in your language. They have overrun our worlds, and we have returned to reclaim our own.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deep in Trent's consciousness an uneasy feeling began to grow.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You are no doubt aware that the entire region of space you refer to as the Sirius Sector was once our home. We have simply returned to what was ours, and we would ask your assistance.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So what happens to the billions of humans who live here now once you move back in?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;All will be as it was before.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Meaning what?&quot;
<br />
<br />	The response was slow in coming. &quot;Perhaps with greater understanding you will comprehend our purpose,&quot; the creature replied. The Dom'Kavash reached out a clawed hand toward Trent. The universe exploded around him in a flash of light.
<br />
<br />
