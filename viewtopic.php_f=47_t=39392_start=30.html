<br />Ch.9
<br />
<br />Alvaro sees images from his past dreams, mostly that of the mysterious aliens. He sees them disappearing, years passing, and strange conversations.
<br />
<br />&#8220;They&#8217;re coming&#8230;.&#8221; &#8220;Man the turrets!!!&#8221; &#8220;WARNING!&#8221; &#8220;Wake that idiot up!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He feels a jolt of pain, and slowly he wakes. All he sees is black, which gradually brightens to show some iron bars. He turns his head to the left, and sees two men throwing trash at him.
<br />&#8220;How does the rat like that!&#8221; said the guard
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s probably the most food he&#8217;s seen in one place!&#8221; said the other
<br />Alvaro turns his head away, and looks to the left, and can see a hallway leading off into somewhere. He can hear the explosions of the battle as distant &#8221;Booms&#8221;, and the blares of the intercom. Alvaro looks around, and sees that the guards are still there. He then hears the sound of a door sliding open. The guards fall silent and go over to the wall. He can see the shadow of something approaching. The mysterious person steps into Alvaro&#8217;s range of view, and he can clearly see his shape; a tall, massive man with a blond military cut with a long, black cape with the Hessian Insignia imprinted into it, as well as an eye patch on his right eye. He steps over to Alvaro&#8217;s chair, grabs Alvaro&#8217;s chin, spits right into Alvaro&#8217;s face.
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure why we bothered to dig you out of that mess&#8221;, he said, &#8220;We should&#8217;ve just let you burned with that tin can&#8221;
<br />
<br />The man turns Alvaro&#8217;s face over to the left, and can see Alvaro&#8217;s eye patch.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh Ho!&#8221; he said, &#8220;It seems you&#8217;ve seen your share of combat!&#8221;
<br />The man reaches over to his trench coat and pulls out a remote and pushes a button. Alvaro can hear some sliding, and the man turns around his chair. Alvaro can see a television mounted on the wall. It shows the battle and pans around towards Crete. What Alvaro sees causes his only eye to widen up; He can see massive fires on certain areas of the cities of the planet.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why!&#8221; he yelled out, &#8220;Why the hell are you doing this!&#8221;
<br />The man punches Alvaro, sending him to fly off his chair. He tries to get up, but both his legs and arms are tied up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What we do is our own business!&#8221; said the man, &#8220;but since these moments will be your last moments alive, I&#8217;ll tell you. Someone sometime ago approached us with a very intriguing offer. He approached our commander in Vogtland, and offered a large amount of credits- 10,000,000,000 for the extermination of the Corsairs, and 50,000,000 upfront for supplies. We don&#8217;t know why he wanted you guys dead or why he&#8217;d be willing to give out so much money, but we didn&#8217;t give a damn. We confirmed the guy had that many credits, so we&#8217;d work for him no matter what. We used the money to buy off blueprints for these warships you&#8217;ve been fighting. They look the same but they aren&#8217;t as any where close as powerful as the Rheinland navy&#8217;s, but the get the job done nonetheless! And plus, we&#8217;d have you guys off our side and have some new places for our ring&#8230;&#8221;
<br />That&#8217;s all Alvaro needed to hear. His train of thought drifted off, and the man&#8217;s words didn&#8217;t seem to matter. Alvaro wondered &#8220;Who&#8217;d want us dead? Even the Bretonians won&#8217;t go as low as a full blown extermination&#8230;&#8221; 
<br />
<br />The man kicks Alvaro in the stomach, sending him flying into the bars. 
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;ll probably be the last time I&#8217;ll ever get to hit a Corsair like that&#8230;&#8221;, he said.
<br />He makes a gesture to the two men outside the prison cell, and leaves. The two men salute him, and come inside. They grab Alvaro and drag him out of the cell, and go down the hall. Alvaro lifts his head up to the wall above him, and sees the words 
<br />&#8220;Airlock&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Crap...&#8221;, thought Alvaro, &#8220;I&#8217;m in a really big mess now&#8230; How will I get out of this mess?&#8221;
<br />
<br />The men drag him towards a gate, and punch some numbers into a keypad. The door opens up to lead to another door, where he proceeds to another keypad to open the door. It opens to lead to another door, and they start pushing Alvaro towards there. They get a knife out, and break Alvaro out of his bonds, and push him to the ground.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We weren&#8217;t supposed to do that&#8221;, said one guard, &#8220;But it&#8217;ll sure be funny to see you squirm!&#8221;
<br />They start leading him to the last door, and Alvaro gets nervous.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Could this be it? Is this really the end of my life! It can&#8217;t be&#8230;&#8221;
<br />The door looms closer, and Alvaro closes his eyes, preparing for the inevitable.
<br />Suddenly, an explosion erupts and rocks the ship, and throws the three in different directions. Alvaro looks at the two guards, who are against the furthest door. He struggles over to the control pad, and raises himself to the keypad. He hits a button, and a warning alarm goes off in two languages
<br />
<br />&#8220;WARNING! AIRLOCK DOORS ARE OPENING!&#8221; and again in another language that Alvaro can&#8217;t understand. The two guards pull themselves up and go towards Alvaro, but the door shuts in front of them. He can hear the banging of the guards on the door, and then a deafening scream cut silent instantly. Alvaro takes a sigh of relief, and makes his way back down the hall, and struggles back to his jail cell. He reaches down to a pipe that the guards had thrown at him, and picks it up. He looks up at the sign, and another sign points to &#8220;armory&#8221;. A small grin goes across his face, and he goes towards the door to the armory. He knocks on it, and puts himself against the wall. A guard comes out of the room, and looks off to the other direction saying &#8220;Anyone there?&#8221; Alvaro grabs his pipe, and slams it into the back of the guard&#8217;s head. The guard falls over into the wall, and Alvaro grabs his legs and drags him into the room. He ties the man up and puts him in a locker. Alvaro goes over to the munitions rack, and grabs 4 weapons- two pistols, one assault rifle, and a shotgun. He starts making his way down to the hall, and starts thinking of things to do.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Should I go for the hangar bay?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;But then I&#8217;d still have to fight this battleship&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Maybe I should go up to the bridge&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Alvaro goes into a small storage closet, and thinks about what to do next.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;d be better for me to go to the bridge, and bring this big bird down&#8230;&#8221;
<br />He grins, and stands up, and makes his way to the elevators. He goes down the hall, and can see the elevators down in the distance. He steps towards them, and presses the down button. He stands there, and can hear some whirring. He turns around, and can see the camera behind him. He focuses on to its lenses, and can see them moving.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh ****&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Alarms start blaring off, and the intercom system begins to say
<br />
<br />&#8220;WARNING! WARNING! INTRUDER SPOTTED ABOARD THE SHIP! HUNT HIM DOWN!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro&#8217;s heart begins to thud, and he sweats uncontrollably.
<br />&#8220;Crap&#8230;&#8221;, he thought to himself, &#8220;Now the place is going to be swarming&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Alvaro keeps a hand on his pistol, and the elevator comes down. The door slides open and the guard standing there reaches for his weapon. Alvaro pulls out his pistol quickly, and shoots into his face. Blood gushes out every where, and splatters all over Alvaro&#8217;s face.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know these things were that messy&#8230;&#8221;, he said to himself. 
<br />
<br />He reaches down into the man&#8217;s uniform, trying to not to look into his shattered face. He pulls out some weaponry, and a keycard. He looks up at the elevator buttons, and presses the one labeled &#8220;bridge&#8221;. Alvaro gets out his Assault Rifle, and puts it to aim in front of him. The elevator opens up, and Alvaro unloads a barrage of bullets. Some guards in front of him fall down to the ground, riddled with bullets. He pulls out his shotgun, and aim at the guards above him. He shoots one, who falls down into the pit, and rolls behind a computer.  Gunshots erupt, and Alvaro shoots up on the walkway above him, shooting the two guards on it. He aims up onto the platform above him, and shoots three guards. More gunshots erupt, and Alvaro looks up above him. He can see a cape, and can here some buttons being pressed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There&#8217;s that bastard!&#8221;, he said to himself.
<br />
<br />The man then runs across the walkway, and gets into the door before he could shoot him. The other guards follow, not bothering to shoot him. Alvaro stands up and makes his way up to the platform above to the control panel. He stands and looks at the console, and suddenly the ship begins to turn. Alvaro looks into the window, and sees that it is turning towards Crete.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell!&#8221;, he thought to himself, &#8220;This thing&#8217;s going on a suicide course! Unless&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro pushes more buttons on the command console, and brings up the cargo bay contents. He scrolls down, and sees an item that catches his attention.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Chemicals&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;If this thing goes and blows up in the atmosphere&#8230; Those chemicals will disperse, and kill us all&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro pushes buttons frantically, trying to control the ship. He brings up the map for autopilot, and touches the ships near him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;WARNING! THE SHIP&#8217;S TRAJECTORY COURSE IS NOT SAFE! ABO&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro shoots into the control panel, and the ship begins to turn towards the nearest group of battleships. The ship turns away from Crete.
<br />
<br />He runs across the walkway, and opens the door. He runs down the hallway, and sees the sign: &#8220;Railway to Hanger Bay&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />He makes his way down a hall and opens a massive door. The room has a massive rail system, with only one car remaining. Two guards try to run to it, and Alvaro runs as well. The guards go in, and Alvaro jumps in with them. The car blasts off, and the guards engage Alvaro. Alvaro punches one, and then grabs him and throws him off the car. His screams fill the hall, and the sound of the man being electrocuted. The other guard lands a kick on Alvaro, sending him to the front of the car. The guard pulls out a knife and jumps on Alvaro. He tires to slit Alvaro&#8217;s throat, but Alvaro grabs his wrist. The two try and get an edge over each other, and the guard slowly pulls the knife towards Alvaro.
<br />&#8220;Damn&#8230;&#8221;, Alvaro thought to himself, &#8220;That idiot is really going to kill me&#8221;  
<br />
<br />Alvaro then remembers an old move his brother thought him, and gets his legs into position. He lands a powerful kick into the groin, grabs the man, and throws him off the car. Alvaro takes a sigh of relief, and makes his way over to the command console. He puts up the speed, and the car blasts towards the door in the front. Alvaro can see the ships of the hangar bay looming in front of him, and some empty rail cars blasting back towards the bridge. The hangar bay door starts to close, and Alvaro gets nervous.
<br />&#8220;NOO!&#8221;, he thought to himself, &#8220;I have to get through that door!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro pushes the speed control to maximum, and lies on the floor. The rail car goes fast, and runs right off the rail, and flies through the hangar bay door into hangar bay. Alvaro pokes his head out, and can see Sabres lifting off. A guard runs right by him, not bothering to kill him. Alvaro looks around, and sees his Titan in a corner, fully repaired. He runs over to it, and sees a guard running for it. He pulls out his assault rifle and shoots the man in his head. He jumps into the cockpit, and blasts towards the hangar bay door. He blasts through the Hangar Bay door, and looks behind him. The battleship begins to blast towards another battleship, and collides into it. The battleship ruptures, and explodes into a massive green explosion. The other ships around it spin out of control into Crete and burn up into the atmosphere. The other battleship goes towards Crete, and disappears into the atmosphere. Some blasts hit him, and he turns his ship around. There are three Sabre looming right in front of him, and the center one hails him, and a picture of a blond man with an eye patch appears- the Commander.
<br />&#8220;YOU BASTARD!&#8221;, he said, &#8220;You ruined my plans! But no matter, you&#8217;ll be destroyed soon by me and my two greatest fighters! You&#8217;ll regret the day you crossed paths with Commander Otto the scythe!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Crap&#8230;&#8221;, Alvaro thought to himself, &#8220; There&#8217;s no way I can handle those three by myself&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Another Titan pulls up next to Alvaro, and hails him.
<br />&#8220;HEY!&#8221;, he said, &#8220;You&#8217;re alive! Thank GOD!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;DAD!&#8221;, yelled Alvaro, &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you think? I&#8217;m here to help you fight those two bastards!&#8221;, he said.
<br />
<br />A Valkrie comes up next to him on the other side
<br />
<br />&#8220;Van Clausen!&#8221;, said Alvaro
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey kid!&#8221; said Van Clausen, &#8220;You&#8217;ve already gone through your share of fun, now it&#8217;s my turn!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Cut the chatter!&#8221;, said the Hessian, &#8220;It&#8217;s time for you guys to die!&#8221; 
<br />The ships begin to get closer to each other, and Alvaro gets his hand on the trigger. He wipes his sweat of his face, and touches his eye patch.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Time to rumble!&#8221;, said Otto
<br />

			<div class="content">Perhaps I could insert a little suggestion?
<br />
<br />All of you lines, especially the dialogue, are running together.  Your story would be much easier on the eyes if you were to insert space between the dialogue and the paragraphs.  Example: 
<br />
<br /><b>You have: </b>
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>&#8220;There&#8217;s that bastard!&#8221;, he said to himself
<br />The man then runs across the walkway, and gets into the door before he could shoot him. The other guards follow, not bothering to shoot him. Alvaro stands up and makes his way up to the platform above to the control panel. He stands and looks at the console, and suddenly the ship begins to turn. Alvaro looks into the window, and sees that it is turning towards Crete.
<br />&#8220;What the hell!&#8221;, he thought to himself, &#8220;This thing&#8217;s going on a suicide course! Unless&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Alvaro pushes more buttons on the command console, and brings up the cargo bay contents. He scrolls down, and sees an item that catches his attention.
<br />&#8220;Chemicals&#8221;
<br />&#8220;If this thing goes and blows up in the atmosphere&#8230; Those chemicals will disperse, and kill us all&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Alvaro pushes buttons frantically, trying to control the ship. He brings up the map for autopilot, and touches the ships near him.
<br />&#8220;WARNING! THE SHIP&#8217;S TRAJECTORY COURSE IS NOT SAFE! ABO&#8230;&#8221;
<br />Alvaro shoots into the control panel, and the ship begins to turn towards the nearest group of battleships. The ship turns away from Crete
<br />He runs across the walkway, and opens the door. He runs down the hallway, and sees the sign
<br />&#8220;Railway to Hanger Bay&#8221; <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

			<div class="content">Ch. 10 
<br />
<br />Alvaro hits his thrusters and blasts towards the three; Van Clausen to his left, and his father to his right. He hits his trigger and unloads his lasers, as do the others. Lasers go flying off everywhere, and smash against his cockpit. All he can see are the marks of the laser blasts against his cockpit.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn!&#8221;, he thought to himself, &#8220;Those guys are loaded!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He reaches for the &#8220;clean up&#8221; button, and presses it. The cockpit clears up, and he can see a Sabre blasting right towards him. He cuts his engines, pulls his stick towards himself, and blasts upwards, nearly getting hit by the sabre. He ejects out a mine, and the resulting explosion sends the other Sabre spinning out of control. He turns his ship back around and goes towards the Sabre, and unloads his lasers on it. He sees the lasers melt into its shields, and slowly he can see his lasers smash against the hull. He reaches for the missile launcher
<br />
<br />&#8220;DIE!&#8221;, he yelled
<br />
<br />He launches two missiles, and they smash against the Sabre, destroying it on contact. Suddenly, his ship goes flying off, spinning out of control.
<br />
<br />&#8221;That ship was loaded with explosives&#8230;&#8221;, he sighed.
<br />
<br />He hits the stabilize button and the ship fires its boosters, and slows down his ship. He puts his radar on, and sees that Van Clausen and his dad took out the other ship. He turns towards Otto and hails him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Any last words?&#8221;, said Alvaro
<br />&#8220;Yea&#8221;, he said, &#8220;Look behind you!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He turns his rear HUD view on, and sees that there is a squadron of 8 Sabres coming his way.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry kid&#8221;, said Van Clausen, &#8220;We&#8217;ll take care of these idiots!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that guy get away!&#8221;, said Octavio
<br />
<br />Alvaro hits his engines and chases Otto. They blast towards the battle, and Otto takes a path right through the battleship formation. His ship gets hit by stray lasers from other battles, as well as the surrounding battleships. He keeps his ship on Otto, who leads him towards one of the battleships. They fly across the side of the battleships, weaving through the hail of the laser beams going towards the planet. Alvaro gets his crosshairs on Otto and squints his left eye as he steadies the crosshair.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Time for you to die!&#8221;, he said
<br />
<br />Suddenly, a laser beam fires from the surface, smashing against the hull. Debris flies everywhere, pounding into his cockpit. All Alvaro can see is the smoke from the ship spill out into space, and crew mates being sucked out into the darkness of space. All he can see in front of him is a swirl of gasses, debris, and the floating corpses of crew members being sucked out into the void.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn&#8230;&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see jack&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />He reaches over to the button on the left side of his helmet, and presses it. His vision changes into a swirl of different colors, and he can see the outline of a sabre in the distance. He goes towards it, and exits the cloud. He presses the button once again, and exits again. He blasts towards him, following him around the cockpit, and to the other side of the battleship. Otto goes along the side of the ship, and Alvaro follows him. More laser beams erupt from the surface, pounding the battleship. Explosions erupt on the side of ship, and the battleship begins to turn towards the planet. He sees Otto take a sharp right through the hangar bay, and follows him through. He maneuvers his ship in, and can see the expansive hangar bay. All the Sabre&#8217;s are piled against the rear of the ship, and he can see pilots fall towards the pile of junk. He follows Otto through, dodging the falling ships, and to the other side. He can see the planeside
<br />
<br />&#8220;OH ****!&#8221;, he yelled, &#8220;That bastard!&#8221;
<br /> 
<br />His ship plunges into the atmosphere, and Alvaro looks around him, and can see his ship begin to glow red. Crete&#8217;s strong gravity is slowly pulling him in towards the planet, and he knows he must act soon, or he will die. He hits his rear thrusters, and positions himself to go the other direction, and hits all of his thrusters. The ship goes slow, and is pushed back by the debris of the ship. He reaches over to the master command console, and reroutes all of his power to his engines. His ship exerts a massive white explosion, and sends his ship flying in the opposite direction. He gets out of the atmosphere&#8217;s reach, and blasts over the falling battleship. Just as he gets over though, laser shots hit his left wing, and he can see the wing fly off into the distance. He can see Otto off in the distance, unloading his laser barrage. Alvaro hits his engines, and flies off towards another battleship, with Otto close on his tale. He begins to frantically reroute his power back to his weapons and shields. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn&#8230;&#8221;, thought Alvaro, &#8220;that was his plan the whole time&#8230; To catch me with out my shields!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro strafes back and forth, in deferent directions, using a piece of debris from the battleship. The piece of metal slowly descends towards Crete, and Alvaro is forced to move away from it. He looks up, and sees a twin trail of missiles coming towards them. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh crap&#8230;&#8221;, Alvaro said.
<br />
<br />He looks down at his HUD, at the progress meter. His hand is clutched tightly to the controls, and he is sweating all over.
<br />
<br />&#8220;50%.....
<br />
<br />The ship begins to blare off the &#8220;missile locked&#8221; alarm.
<br />&#8230;75%....
<br />Alvaro can see the Hessian symbol on the tips of the missiles.
<br />99%&#8221;
<br />He can see the missiles&#8217; every marking now.
<br />
<br />Alvaro takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, and hears a humming noise. The explosion engulfs the whole ship, and the fiery orange cloud engulfs his ship. Alvaro blinks a couple of times, and looks down at the console. A voice comes over the intercom
<br />
<br />&#8220;Power reroute successful! Shields restored!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro punches his thrusters and flies towards away from planet side, going parallel to the falling behemoth. He looks over to the left, and can see the battleship begin to glow a bright orange towards the bridge, and it begins to break down. Alvaro looks in front of him, and can see the sabre waiting for him. He keeps his hands on the trigger, and blasts towards Otto. He begins to fire all his lasers, and Otto does the same. Their laser beams collide together, and create a massive light. Alvaro covers his right eye, and the bright light engulfs his cockpit. He struggles to see what&#8217;s ahead of him, but all he sees nothing. A jolt rumbles his ship, and he jumps and hits his head on his cockpit. 
<br />
<br />&#8221;I guess he ran into me&#8230;&#8221;, said Alvaro to himself, &#8220;Probably means that he&#8217;s in the same situation I&#8217;m in&#8230;.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Slowly, his vision begins to come back to normal. He sees a green blur in front of him. Alvaro wipes his eyes, and suddenly sees a massive piece of debris from a battleship. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh crap!&#8221;, yelled Alvaro. 
<br />
<br />He reaches down to his console and hits his rear thrusters, and pulls back on his control stick. His ship blasts parallel to the debris, blasting right past it. Alvaro types in some commands in to his nav-comp, and locks on to Otto&#8217;s position. He sees a radar display pop up, and sees a green dot- him, and a red dot- Otto. They&#8217;re right next to each other.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell is this!&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;It says he&#8217;s right next to me&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro looks right and left of him, and can&#8217;t see where Otto&#8217;s ship is. He looks up, and sees that he&#8217;s nearing the end of the debris.
<br />
<br />&#8220;He&#8217;s not around me&#8230;&#8221;, he said, &#8220;But then that means&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro reaches down to his thrusters, and engages it on full power, and blasts to the top. He releases a mine, and keeps a HUD view on it. He sees a sabre appear on the other side, and runs into the mine. His HUD view goes into static.
<br />&#8220;Now it&#8217;s time to finish this!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro goes back towards Otto, and begins to fire at him. He sees that Otto does the same, but only half of its power. Alvaro spins and strafes, and manages to dodge his shots, and lands many shots on the Sabre. He clips the other wing, and passes right by it. He looks up at his HUD, and sees that Otto is blasting towards the disabled battleship that they fought around a moment ago.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell is he going back there towards!?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro brings down his radar and sees that another battleship is at the other side, receiving escape pods and stragglers. Otto is heading to a hole on the part of the battleship that still hasn&#8217;t entered the atmosphere.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That coward!&#8221;, yelled Alvaro, &#8220;He&#8217;s trying to run off!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro engages his cruise engines and blasts towards Alvaro. Within half a minute, Alvaro reaches Otto. They are right in front of the battleship, and Alvaro disengages his cruise engines and follows him through. Decks and layers of the ships zoom by, and Alvaro slowly gains on Otto.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get him&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;If he passes through the other side, he&#8217;ll be home free to the other battleship&#8230;and firing lasers will cause this thing to collapse on us&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro can see the battle through the hole, and knows that they are getting closer. He reaches over to his throttle stick, and pulls it all the way forward, and engages full thrusters. He blasts past Otto, and goes towards the exit. Just as he exits, he drops a heavy mine and blocks the hole.
<br />The battleship goes through the atmosphere, and Alvaro sees a bright orange glow around it. It gets engulfed, and the massive behemoth breaks apart, and falls to Crete. Alvaro feels bad for a moment, knowing that the man would probably feel immense pain, and suffer a slow death as his body was torn apart with his ship. Alvaro looks down at his hand, and slowly reaches over to the throttle stick to jump back into the defense of Crete, when suddenly he sees a shadow project over his controls.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the&#8230;!?&#8221;, said Alvaro
<br />
<br />He looks up, and sees a man in a space suit waving at him. The man proceeds to the rear of the ship, and cuts the power. Alvaro hears the ship hum off, and sees the man reach into his belt and pulls out an object, which he inserts into the ship. Alvaro reaches over to his oxygen tank and connects it to his space suit. He looks up at his cockpit window, and sees it slowly opening. Alvaro reaches over for his knife, and sees the man come from the behind of his ship. He pulls himself out, and turns his magnetic boots to keep him on the ship. The man pulls out his own knife, and lunges at Alvaro. Alvaro pulls the man&#8217;s knife out of his hands, and throws him against the ship. As he throws the man, he can see the face through his helmet- A man with an eye patch over his right eye. The man lands against the ship, and picks himself up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8230;?!&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;I thought you were riding that ship to your doom?!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8221;Yes, it looked like I was screwed&#8221;, said Otto, &#8220;But as your ship passed, I was already out of my ship, and grabbed your wing. If that ship was something else, I would&#8217;ve not been able too, but those Titans are like cows; they won&#8217;t be able to out fly any of our ships.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yet&#8221;, sighed Alvaro, &#8220;You guys were never able to defeat us, and had to use big ships to try to, and yet we are still the better pilots&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You shut your mouth, trash!&#8221;, said Otto, &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as being fair in war! If you see a vunerablitiy in the enemy, exploit it for your victory!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He lunges runs towards Alvaro, and tackles him. Alvaro loses his grip on his knife, and it goes flying off into the darkness of space.
<br />
<br />&#8221;Now we&#8217;re even!&#8221;, said Otto
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn&#8230;&#8221;, thought Alvaro, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had any combat experience in these kinds of situations, and Otto clearly has. I need to find a way to get him&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro looks back towards Crete&#8217;s surface, and sees a bright blue glow emerging from a spot on the surface. He smiles to himself, and tackles Otto, sending him flying out into space.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You idiot!&#8221;, said Otto, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you realize that I&#8217;ll just come back!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He sees Otto reach over to his boots to push his boosters, but before he could, a massive laser beam erupts and comes straight towards him. He gets his boosters on and franticly tries to get out of the way. He reaches out towards Alvaro, his left eye right open, and yells through the frequency
<br />
<br />&#8220;DAMN Y&#8230;!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He was cut short, and his whole body was engulfed and vaporized. Alvaro sees his body slowly vaporize, yet his face seemed to go away the slowest. The look of his eyes gets burned into Alvaro&#8217;s memory, and Alvaro continues looking at the passing beam. It disappears, and nothing is left, except a piece of his helmet and a tattered eye patch. Alvaro clenches the eyepatch in his hand, and returns back to power generator of the ship. He releases a nano-bot to repair his cut power, and pulls the remote control out of the ship&#8217;s engine. He can see the cockpit&#8217;s controls come back to life. He goes back into the cockpit and hooks the ship&#8217;s oxygen into his suit, and powers up his ship and flies back towards battle. His father and Van Clausen join up on his formation.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Did you get him!&#8221;, said Octavio
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sure did!&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;Got blown away by a laser beam&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;A fitting end!&#8221;, said Van Clausen, &#8220;For a rat like him&#8221;
<br />&#8220;The guy I was chasing&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Before Octavio could finish, a massive battleship emerges from planet side. Alvaro&#8217;s left eye opens up widely, and he sees an ancient battleship emerge. The insignia of the Corsairs is imprinted on the hull, and a simple label towards the rear of the ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hispania&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What in the world?...&#8221;, said Alvaro.
<br />
<br />The intercom interrupts his thought
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Commander Chavez calling all Corsairs, form up on the battleship that has been marked on your radar!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro blasts towards the battleship and forms up on Chavez&#8217;s formation.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is that!&#8221;, said Alvaro, I thought that our sleeper ship was no where near here!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the sleeper ship&#8221;, started Chavez, &#8220;it just shares the same name. It&#8217;s of an ancient design from the earlier days of our people&#8217;s times, before we were sent to live in this hell&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro looks back towards the ship, and sees that he is right. The ship is very junky, and looks old compared to the pictures of the battleships he saw on the holonet. He can see that there are many weapons emplaced on the ship, and can see that the ship will defiantly help in the battle.
<br />
<br />&#8221;But Commander!&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;There&#8217;s only one, and those Hessians have at least six of their own still operational!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8221;Yes&#8221;, said Chavez, &#8220;We&#8217;ve outfitted the ship with heavy weaponry, but this battleship will need heavy support. Plus, this ship has something extra!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro looks back at the front of the ship, and can see it opening up to reveal a weapon. It glows blue, and fires a massive laser beam at one of the battleships, destroying it outright; Alvaro&#8217;s left eye opens widely.
<br />
<br />The Supreme Commander comes over the Corsair frequency.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Behold the power of our battleship!&#8221;, said Supreme Commander Ramirez, &#8220;It&#8217;ll take a while to recharge, so defend this ship, for it&#8217;ll turn the tide of battle!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro pulls back to his father&#8217;s formation, and follows him to protect the battleship. All the Corsairs form up on the battleship. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;May our ancestors guide us to victory! LONG LIVE THE CORSAIRS!&#8221;, said Ramirez
<br />

<br />Ch. 11
<br />
<br />Alvaro grabs his controls, and increases his speed. A bright red light engulfs his cockpit, and an alarm sounds. He looks down at his console, and sees that it is showing that much of his ship is shown as a red outline, meaning that it&#8217;s damaged. Alvaro slams his hand on the console and grumbles, and hails Commander Chavez.
<br />
<br />&#8221;SIR! I need to land on the Hispania for repairs!&#8221;, he said
<br />
<br />&#8221;Roger&#8221;, replied Chavez, &#8220;proceed to the ship&#8217;s aft hangar bay for repairs. The main hangar bay is reserved for deployment and severe damage only.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Roger!&#8221;, said Alvaro. He reaches over to his com and hails Octavio
<br />
<br />&#8220;Dad, you&#8217;re on your own, I need to land for repairs&#8221;, said Alvaro
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok&#8221;, said Octavio, &#8220;Come out quick, we will need every man in this battle!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro pulls back towards the massive ship and hails the ship. The doors on the planet side of the massive ship open up, and he pilots his ship around. The ship blares out an announcement.
<br />&#8220;Ship has engaged in autopilot&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro releases his grip on the stick, and takes off his helmet. He takes a long sigh and sits back as his ship makes its way towards the massive hangar door. It opens a bit, and his ship flies through. It slowly makes its way through another hangar door, once again, only opening a bit. As his ship flies through, Alvaro sees the hangar bay. Many Titans are being flown out another hangar door, directly in front of him, right into the fray. His Titan lands and is secured by a crane, clenching his titan by his wings. Alvaro lifts his mask off and pushes the cockpit button. He puts his helmet onto his chair and jumps out of his titan. He takes a deep breath, commands some of the technicians to repair his ship, and walks towards a bay door. As he walks towards it, the bay doors opens up, and a robed man with three guards. Alvaro drops to his knees, and bows his head.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Greetings great Elder, you honor me with your presence!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Elder motions him to arise, and pulls down his hood. The face of a young man is revealed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What?!?&#8221;, said Alvaro confusingly, &#8220;I thought the Elders were much older!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The man chuckles, surprising his guards.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yea&#8221;, said the man, &#8220;I&#8217;m probably the youngest Elder in Crete since Elder Francisco. My name is Elder Carlos de Ferdinand. I&#8217;m replacing my father, who unfortunately died of a stroke while strolling in Nova Sevilla&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />Elder Ferdinand looks over Alvaro&#8217;s shoulder, over to the technicians repairing his ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m assuming you are here because your ship is damaged&#8221;, said Ferdinand
<br />
<br />Alvaro chuckles nervously
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes Sir&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;It went through a lot, and I really didn&#8217;t notice it until the nav-comp started blaring out warnings&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well&#8221;, said Ferdinand, &#8220;We can&#8217;t just have you doing nothing! Lieutenant..?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alvaro Gulliento, sir&#8221;, said Alvaro.
<br />
<br />&#8220;ALVARO!&#8221;, blurts out one of the guards, &#8220;Is it really you!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;You are&#8230;?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;, said the guard, &#8220;You probably can&#8217;t recognize me with this mask on!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The guard pulls his helmet off, revealing the face of Alvaro&#8217;s old mentor, Alonso.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My God!&#8221;, said Alonso, You look completely different from the scrawny kid I saw two months ago!&#8221;	
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sorry to interrupt this&#8221;, said Ferdinand, &#8220;But you&#8217;ll probably need to come with us Alvaro. We are going into the armory; you should go ahead and arm yourself with boarding equipment&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wait, what!&#8221;, said Alvaro.
<br />
<br />The Elder proceeds towards another door, and Alvaro is dragged by Alonso.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What does he mean by &#8220;boarding equipment!? Are we really gonna board a ship!&#8221;, said Alvaro.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yup&#8221;, said Alonso, &#8220;Elder says he needs some good Corsairs to cause some trouble onboard the primary command ship for the Hessians&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alvaro doesn&#8217;t say anything, and follows the guards and the Elder to the armory, and are joined by even more Corsairs. They proceed into the Armory and open up the lockers inside. Alvaro pulls out a set from one of the lockers and dons the suit, and puts on a helmet with a visor. As he does so, the Elder pulls up a hologram.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok guys!&#8221;, said Elder Ferdinand, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the plan!&#8221;
<br />
<br />He proceeds over to the hologram, and points over to a large battleship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You all will be boarding this battleship here. It is the main ship for the Hessians, and attacking it will obviously bring confusion to their forces. You guys will board the ship through our traditional methods. I have to stay behind to direct our space forces. Good Luck!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Elder Ferdinand goes over to the wall and pushes a button. It reveals a door to an odd shaped ship, and the Corsairs proceeds in. Alvaro is pushed along with the crowd. Alvaro looks around at the odd ship. It&#8217;s small for a ship, and there is only one chair for the pilot. The other Corsairs have to stand. He feels the ship jolt and sees the cockpit&#8217;s blasts shields open up to reveal the space outside. The ship detaches from the Hispania, and proceeds towards the battleship. Alvaro goes next to Alonso, and asks him a question.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Uh Alonso&#8221;, started Alvaro, &#8220;How are we exactly gonna get in there? I see that we have no escorts or a laser cutter to cut through the hangar bay&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s because we ain&#8217;t going in that way&#8221;, said Alonso.
<br />
<br />Alvaro look out the cockpit, and sees that they are nearing the battleship. He feels a jolt, and feels the ship accelerate.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You guys better hang on tight!&#8221;, said the pilot, &#8220;We are going to have a rough landing&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh crap!&#8221;, said Alvaro, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Alonso chuckles, and ignores Alvaro. Alvaro looks out towards the cockpit, andhe sees that they are approaching the battleship rapidly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh Shi..&#8221;
<br />
<br />End Ch 11

			<div class="content">Once I finish the first volume, I'll allow you to translate it. At the moment, it is not completed. You can still translate it, but at the rate that I'm writing these and the rate you could probably translate, you'll probably translate all the chapters I've written before I could write two of these chapters.
