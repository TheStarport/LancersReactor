			<div class="content">This is the official webstory thread. This is where the story will take place.
<br />
<br />Before we start, I want to explain a few things.
<br />
<br />Foremost: <b>The story doesn't take place in the FL universe.   </b> But off course, there undoubtly be some Freelancer influences (like ship and planet names)
<br />
<br />I am the story-teller. All the major actions that happen are thought of by me and I will determine their outcome.
<br />
<br />It's not an classic RPG, where's worked with THACO and AC and stuff like that. If you're hit, you're hit <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />When you want to say something that does not have anything to do with the story, please put the text OOC: (out of character) infornt of it.
<br />
<br />Things said by your character should look like this:
<br />&lt;charachter name&gt;: &lt;text&gt;
<br />Actions (big actions) should look like this:
<br />*Terranova runs to his ship and departs as fast as he can*
<br />
<br />Last but not least: if people will spam or flame this topic, I will at first delete those posts. When it continues, I will delete it without a warning! So think before you post please!
<br />
<br />Have fun people <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Remember, you are your character, try to think about how your character would react in certain situations.

			<div class="content">GM: It was raining that day, just like the day before. The weather forecast wasn't positive. Luckily, Terranova can just enter his ship and depart to more exotic locations in the universe. But he didn't. He decided to go to the recreations room for some... well... recreation. 
<br />As soon he enters the room he spots a stranger mysteriously sitting in the left corner.
<br />
<br />*Terranova approaches the stranger*
<br />
<br />Terranova: Hello, I haven't seen your face on New Harlem before. My name is Vincenzo Terranova, but my friends like to call me Vinnie. May I ask who I'm talking to?
<br />
<br />Gm: He did not know that the man he was talking to was <b>Conner Jason Almasy
<br /> </b> and that those were going to become close friends.

<br />OOC: Just one thing, it's kindof hard to give every one a big role in this story. So please accept thag some people will have a much important role than others but I'll try to use anyone that signed up.</div>

			<div class="content">(Conner was lost in deep thought when a man approached him to talk and who goes by the name of Vinnie, short for Vincenzo Terranova)
<br />
<br />*Connor stops his pondering and looks up at Terranova*
<br />
<br />Connor: Hi Vinnie, my name is Connor Almasy, but most people know me as Eraser because of....well, that&#180;s a long story. To answer your question, yes it&#180;s my first time to New Harlem. I&#180;m just passing through here on my way to Queens. I work for myself as a Freelancer and I took on a mission to &#180;acquire&#180; some Luxury Consumer Goods and a large amount of....
<br />
<br />*Connor stops for a second and looks nervously left and right to see if there are any police officers, military officers or anyone other who looks suspicious overhearing the discussion, but luckely nobody is, so he continues*
<br />
<br />...Cardamine and bring it to some guy about 20 miles from the landing strip on Queens, no questions asked. I already have the stuff safely stowed away in my cargo hold. Perhaps you saw my ship at the equipment dealer. It&#180;s the heap of junk that dogs don&#180;t even find worthy enough to piss against ! But seriously though, I underestimated my target by far, because when I attacked the freighter I was supposed to hit in the Cerberus Cloud, they were far better armored and equiped than anticipated. They even got reinforcements I didn&#180;t count on, but in the end I managed to &#180;erase&#180; my target and accompanying escort. However, the consequence was that they breached my hull and seriously damaged my ship. So I landed here for some major repairs. These kind of missions however are just routine for me..
<br />
<br />*Connor laughs*
<br />
<br />Connor: But enough about me, what&#180;s your bussines here on New Harlem ?</div>

<br />
<br />(Andrew Arrigoni wandered in fumbling with a small pad. It had a system map on it but he had no idea where he was. It was busted and didn't just his location.)
<br />
<br />*He noticed what appeared to be two locals discussing.....something....he missed what it was. He approached.*
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: Hey, the names Andrew Arrigoni. I guess you could call me a Zoner......But I don't think so, even though I stop by them from time to time......but here's my question. My map device is busted and I haven't updated my Neural net in years. How do I find my way through New York to the New Jersey Jumpgate. I need to find Planet Atlantic. I fear my time mastering the Edge screwed up my sense of direction here at home *Nervous chuckle* A man working for Hilton Industries wants me to take him out to the Edge worlds so he can prospect for a new Casino Location. It seems that New Jersey and New Nevada aren't enough.
<br />
<br />*Noticing that he just let out a mouthfull of crap he waited for a response. He noticed the conversation on the side.*
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: (Mumbled to self) I think I've see that guy at Ruiz before.

			<div class="content">Lutz stared aimlessly at the bar... his thoughts lost, his mind adrift. He wandered back over the last few days, he couldn't believe what was happening. One minute in the Navy, next a fugitive. And all he wanted was his wife...
<br />He wracked his brains, trying to think of a solution, anyway to get back home. Home. Uh, the name was going to be lost for a while. Home was that hunk of junk in the hanger, his stolen Defender-xs.
<br />He looke around, taking in his surroundings. Not many people here. A couple of what appeared to be regulars, the odd guy here and there, and a party of three over by the window. They looked odd, mismatched almost. In an effort to take hi mind off things and the fact that curosity had got the better of him, Lutz rose...

			<div class="content">New Harlem: &quot;This is planet New Harlem docking ring to Freelancer Omega 3 -5, you have permission to land...&quot;
<br />
<br />Finally, after days of being on the run it was a good feeling to set foot on solid ground again. Although, New Harlem wasn't actually his first choice, problems with his cruise engines had forced him to land.
<br />He was glad he made it this far. He had been chased by several Bounty Hunters all the way from Dublin, where he just picked up a full load of gold. And New Harlem being a planet mostly populated by the IMG, who mine copper and silver from deep under the crust, provided a save haven for him.
<br />
<br />Equipment Dealer: &quot;Well well, a Falcon, havent seen that one in a while. How can I help you my friend?&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael: &quot;My cruise engines are allmost completely offline, also, could you have a look at my scanner? I'd like to see my enemies <b>before     </b> I get shot.&quot;
<br />
<br />Equipment dealer: &quot;ahh yes, ahm. The cruise engine is no problem for me, but for the scanner I need an academic to take a look at it, because that's hitech. None of my field.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael: &quot;And I take it, your academic is not around?&quot;
<br />
<br />Equipment dealer: &quot;No, he got spaced by some Pirates last week. A new one will be comming, but that will take a day or two.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael: &quot;Never mind about the scanner then, as long as you get the cruise back online, its allright. Also, could you fill her up? I'm kinda low on nanno's and bats.&quot;
<br />
<br />Equipment dealer: &quot;Allright, concider it done.&quot;
<br />
<br />As he left the equipment shop, he thought of taking a quick nap while his ship was being repaired. But the idea of a nice Sidewinder Fang clearing his throat after such a heavy trip, seemed more attractive to him.
<br />
<br />As he entered the bar, he suddenly remembered seeing a ship on the landing platform. He wasn't sure, but it looked like a defender. A very tippical defender. But the bartender interrupted his thoughts, reminding him of what he came for.
<br />Unaware of the socializing events that took place behind his back, he quitely enjoyed his drink.

			<div class="content">Quigley was fit to be tied.  He stalked through the dark bar, searching every dark corner.  He accomplished just like his client had asked.  That Liberty Rogue had murdered his client's son, now the Rogue was slag outside Dawson Base.  What hadn't gone as planned was Unioner raiding party that wanted to dock at Dawson and took exception to Quigley's wasting the Rogue.
<br />
<br />He's managed to drive off the Unioners and limp out to the trade line.  Now the Cerulean Dream, Quigley's Enhanced Patriot, was missing its port fin and its agility was cut in half.  On top of it all, Quigley found out the payment for the job hadn't been transferred to his Neural Net.  After that disturbing revelation, he had beat it back to New Harlem with all possible speed to track down the low-life who owed his credits.  Until he got those credits, the Dream was an ugly, slow eyesore.
<br />
<br />Quigley turned and saw his client heading out the rear exit.
<br />
<br />Quigley: Danson! Danson! Get back here; I should be handing you your lungs!
<br />
<br />Quigley rushed as fast as he could through the crowded bar.  Danson, the little slime, slipped out the door.  Quigley saw that he only needed to get past one more table before he was in the open and could get after his former employer.
<br />
<br />Just then in one of the turn of events that some diety like causing to set a mortal's world upside, someone behind pushed him out of the way hard.  Off balance, Quigley was propelled into the last table in front of him.  Instance before he hit the table, his brain registered that their was one man at the table and two standing near it.  One was perplexed by a small datapad; the others perflexed by him.  Then he hit the table, tangling with it as it and he toppled over.  As he tried to clear his head, he realized that he was covered in alcohol.  
<br />
<br />Quigley: Well, at least no one else got drenched.  Best luck I've had all day.

			<div class="content">GM: There they were: Terranova, Connor, and Lutz. All suprised by that man who dived over the table, spilling their beers! Well... actually it was Connor's beer because he was the only one who didn't have to fly for a while.
<br />
<br />*Terranova walks over to Quigley and swiftly lifts him... holding him up in the sky like they only saw Darth Vader do that in the movies. Only this time, Terranova lifted him with his bare hands. Not with use of the force. Terranova saw that Connor and Lutz were suprised by seeing that much strength in him.*
<br />
<br />Terranova: &quot;I work out guys...&quot; He said with a smile.
<br />&quot;Now back to your slimebag! What the hell do you think you're doing?
<br /> 
<br />GM: Terranova was talking louder and louder by each word. He suddenly realised that this wasn't the place to let his anger take control of his body. The other guys were shocked by the amount of anger shown by Vincenzo. He put Quigley and put him back on the ground.
<br />
<br />Terranova: Forgive me, my manners were pretty rude there. Now, what happened? Why the fuss?
<br />
<br />GM: At that time, Lutz and Connor were looking at Arrigoni, who was lying past out on the floor. They tried to get him back to the real world, instead of the dream world.</div>

			<div class="content">Lutz was shocked. Never before had he seen such power in man. Terranova had lifted the stranger without even breaking a sweat, and he wasn't exactly tiny either. Worryingly still, he'd never known such anger rise so fast before. This Terranova could certain become a powerful ally, or a dangerous enemy
<br />The name of Quigley he'd heard gasp through the lips of the stranger. He'd thought he'd heard it elsewhere, but couldn't put his finger on the name. Glancing down at the guy who'd been whacked on the head, Lutz remembered him going on about a busted system map. Leaving Conner and Terranova to help out the hapless Quigley, Lutz retrieved that damaged pad and nudged the stranger at his feet with a foot, producing the desired groan. Quickly flipping off the back he by-passed the main resistor, transferring power through the subsystems. The pad flashed to life. The stranger on the floor rose to his feet groggily, staring about a bit vacant eyed.
<br />
<br />Lutz: Here, I fixed your System Map. Mind if I borrow it for a moment?
<br />
<br />Unknown stranger: Erm, no sure sure...
<br />
<br />The stranger looked around, dazed and confused...
<br />
<br />Unknown Stranger: What the hell happened?
<br />
<br />Lutz: Bar fight. You got smacked on the head. You'll have a lump the size of a boiled egg there in the morning no doubt.
<br />
<br />Lutz continued to press the buttons on the pad, uploaded the information contained with to his Neural Net. 
<br />
<br />Lutz: here you go, cheers. *Tosses System Map back*
<br />
<br />Unknown Stranger: Thanks, much appreciated. Here, let me bye you a drink, names Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />Lutz panicked. He hadn't have expected to talk to people. Surely his name couldn't have travelled this far?
<br />
<br />Lutz: Names Lutz, and I'm OK on the drink thanks Arrigoni, I gotta split.
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: Hey, no worries. If you're ever around, let me know, I'll stand you that drink. 
<br />
<br />Lutz smiled and nodded, and walked out of the bar, heading to the equipment dealer to restock before he took off. As he left he got one last look at Terranova who was still helping Quigley regain his breath.
<br />
<br />Terranova. He had a sense he'd run into him again, sooner rather than later, and Lutz instincts were uncannily correct at times...</div>

			<div class="content">After chasing off a couple wings of Kusari Police fighters who were getting a little too close to the convoy Seki was escorting in the Shi***u system, he figured he'd probably make himself scarce in Kusari space.  Figuring he'd be safer in Liberty space he took his ship, the Tenshi (a modded 'Drake' with a Tizona del Cid, sharper handling characteristics, a mount for his Advanced 'Aegis' class shields...and a nice blue and white angelic paint job), to the nearest jump-hole he knew of, and jumped into the Galileo system.  From there it was pretty uneventful, the typical 'evade-the-bounter-hunter-posse' routine and take down any pirate or merc that was trying to knock off a transport hauling cargo or people or what-have-you.  All in all it was smooth sailing.  Upon entering the Colorado system, he flew right on through it and didn't give a care to it.  All he wanted to do was get to the back-water slum known as New Harlem.
<br />
<br />Sagara, S:  &quot;New Harlem, this is freelancer Tango 3-5, requesting permission to dock.&quot;
<br />
<br />New Harlem:  &quot;Stand by, Tango 3-5.  We have a disturbance on the landing platform.&quot;
<br />
<br />Seki simply swore under his breath, he wanted to make landfall and pick up a couple of new contracts that would get him enough creds to restock his ship.
<br />
<br />New Harlem:  &quot;Holy...!!!  He's cleared the landing platform!  I repeat, the pilot is making a run for it!  Security, intercept him!&quot;  (Seki figured somebody forgot to close the comm channel)
<br />
<br />(a crackling sound of somebody on a portable comm unit): &quot;Security here.  We're kinda en route to a disturbance at the bar...  Johnson, signing off.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sagara, S:  &quot;New Harlem control, this is Tango 3-5, I have your runaway on scanners.  For a few creds and a drink at the bar I could intercept him for you.  And after listening to your voice, I wouldn't mind if you joined me.&quot;  (by the by, the New Harlem operator sounded distincly female).  &quot;I await your response.&quot;

			<div class="content">Terranova talking to Quigley : So basicly you still need to receive some credits from this guy named Danson if I'm not wrong. Well... I haven't seen much action for quite I while. If you like I can help you find that guy in space, because he probably left the planet already. I think two fighters will frighten him more than one. And maybe three will....
<br />
<br />Connor! Come over here quick! How about we three help justice a bit and track down a guy in space. Then we &quot;pursue&quot; him to give mister Quigley the credits as promised. You're in on this?
<br />
<br />And Quicley, if you need any credits for repairs, I'm your man.

			<div class="content">OOC: A post has been deleted since my last visit, and I don't meen mine wiz. After Lutz's first post, someone entered the bar with a kusari accent and holds Lutz at gunpoint and knocks Arrigoni out. What happened to it! The story is not correct anymore!!!! It is very confusing.
<br />
<br />Michael: What the... *turns around quickly*
<br />
<br />A rumble caused him to wake sudden out of his daydream spilling half his drink.
<br />He sees a man lying accros the table in the corner. Suddenly this huge guy picks him up just like that! They seem to have an argue about something. 
<br />
<br />Terranova: ...slimebag! What the hell do you think you're doing?
<br />
<br />*Thought* Man this guy is pissed
<br />
<br />Terranova lowers his voice again so Michael can't overhear anymore, but they seem to have made up pretty quick because they leave, together with a third man.
<br />
<br />All the wile this other guy lays streched accross the floor. KO-ed it seems. He thinks about helping him, but hesitates as he sees a farmilliar face allready walking up to him. 
<br />He watches the two as the one laying on the floor regaines consience. The other guy reaches for his data pad and types in something.
<br />The one lying down introduces him as Arrigoni. 
<br />At that point the helping man looks shocked and makes his way to the equipmentdealer.
<br />
<br />*walks up to Arrigoni*
<br />
<br />Michael: Who was that?
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: Thanks for your concern. 
<br />
<br />Arrigoni looks annoyed by the fact that Michael walked in on him so rudely.
<br />
<br />Michael: Oh, sorry. I'm Michael Armstrong. I didn't see what happened but it looks like someone was quicker than you.
<br />
<br />*Arrigoni gets up*
<br />Arrigoni: Yeah doesn't happen too often. My name is Andrew Arrigoni. I'm sorry, but I don't know who he is. He introduced himself as Lutz, but when I told him my name, he ran off. Allmost like...
<br />
<br />Michael: ...Like what?
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: Forget it. He went to the equipmentdealer I beleve, so if you want to catch up with him, you'd better hurry.
<br />
<br />Michael: Thanks. Are you gonna be allright? 
<br />
<br />Arrigoni: Yeah sure, thanks.
<br />
<br />*Michael starts for the equipment dealer*
<br />
<br />If only he can get there in time, because if he is the one he thinks he is, he needs to talk to him at all costs.
<br />
<br />*Thinks* I hope my ship is ready. I got the feeling i'm gonna need it soon.
