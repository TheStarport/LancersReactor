			<div class="content">Heading to my quarters, I passed two dressed alike pairs of crewmen. They would be heading for the rec area for pareese squares. A difficult game, best left to the young and limber. Once in my quarters, &#8220;Computer, back ground music&#8221; I requested. &#8220;Specify&#8221; came the female voice. Pachelbel Canon in D Major&#8221; I requested. It began playing softly in the back ground. I stretched out on the bed and relaxed. Just thinking of our mission brings on a feeling of desire. Something never attempted before. If, and I am hoping more than if, we succeed, This will mean more for the Federation and the Klingon-Romulan alliances that could be imagined. 
<br />
<br />     My First officer was on his way to check out the nearly on-line holodeck. He wanted to try out a program of his native land of Australia. . He had a disk in hand that he had programed before the mission started of his home and other areas, so he could revisit them. He was a home body. Space was not his cup of tea, but he was always up for a challenge, and never walked away from one. As the door opened , the bright sun light lit the corridor and the heat faired. Home, he thought, and entered.
<br />
<br />     Commander Locutus enjoyed the night shift. Quiet and peaceful. Lt. Steel at the helm and Lt. Leonhart at Ops. Most of the other stations did not need manning unless at yellow or red alert. A lite red flash on the Ops panel got his attention. Mr. Leonhart was on it. More messages from Starfleet. He looked back at Mr Locutus, eyebrows raised, &#8220;A code one priority message for the captain, Sir&#8221; he stated. Locutus touched the com button on the command chair. &#8220;Bridge to Captain Finalday&#8221;
<br />
<br />     Groggily, I must have fell asleep, I reached for the com button by the bed, &#8220;Finalday here&#8221;. &#8220;Sir, A priority message from Starfleet for you.&#8221; Locutus replied. &#8220;Send it to my quarters, Commander.&#8221; I responded, waking on up. I moved over to my desk and activated my consol. An unknown Commodore came on the screen. &#8220;Captain Finalday, I am Commodore Kendo THM. I have been asked to update you on some things that have happened in the last five years.&#8221; Five years, this will take some getting use to. The image continued, &#8220;We have just recovered for another attack by the Borg. Apparently, the damage done by Admiral Janeway several years ago to the Main Borg transwarp node, was not as bad as believed. A new Queen sent two Borg cubes to earth to again attempt to wipe us out. It took over thirty five ships, including several from the Klingons and the Romulans to defeat these new cubes. We are stepping up the rebuilding of our fleets and the alliance is still strong. We do not believe the Borg will attack again for a while, In the mean time, all ships are being refit with the torpedoes that Capt. Janeway brought back from the delta quadrant. The specifications are in this transmission as well. That is all for now, Starfleet Out&#8221;. The signal ended. I hit the save and recode and filed it away. 
<br />
<br />      Captains Log, Star date 0404.30.0806
<br />
<br />I have just concluded my first senior officers meeting. I is good to have most of the crew in operation now. I informed them to a little of the update from Star Fleet. I now have a difficult choice. Do it continue with my private coded messages, with a new equipment test, or do I put it off for a time.  It  will not have any effect on our current status, but it will change a few things. I must continue to think about it. Much is at stake. 
<br />
<br />      It is thirteen days since our arrival here and I can feel some anticipation from the crew as to the current course of action. The transfer of the morning command went smooth and I decided to have a look around. Commander Mustang, full sensor sweep if you please&#8221; I ordered. Within a moment, came the response, &#8220; All clear, captain&#8221;. &#8220;What is the nearest planetoid in this system?&#8221; I asked. The science station responded. &#8220;Alpha 357 is half a days travel at full impulse, Sir, long range scans show and atmosphere but life signs are inconclusive.&#8221; Ensign Justin Arania replied. &#8220;Helm, lay in a course and proceed at full impulse power if you please.&#8221; I ordered. 
<br />
<br />     We were nearing the target, when the sensors picked up a movement on and asteroid. We slowed to one quarter impulse and did a more thorough scan, but found nothing. After another fifteen minuets, we resumed course and speed. The planetoid now showed up on screen. It looked promising. Clearly, there was an atmosphere and plant life. I ordered and standard orbit and had science stations to conduct all possible scans on it. 
<br />
<br />     After about an hour, things began to look promising. I was in my ready room when...&#8221;Intruder alert, Intruder alert. &#8220; I touched the com button, &#8220;Number one, what&#8217;s going on&#8221;. His reply was odd, &#8220; Sir, sensors report an intruder, but we can not isolate it.&#8221; he replied.  I touched the com button again, &#8220;All Hands, Red alert.&#8221; I moved to the door heading to the bridge. It opened as usual. But there was no alarm claxons, no warning light, odd. I turned back into the ready room and did not look up until...&#8221;Ah, Mo Cap..E...Tan. What on earth are you doing way out here?, Hmmm?&#8221; the voice continued. &quot;I see humanity still has so much to learn, Tisk, Tisk, Tisk.&#8221; I found my voice, &quot;What are You doing here.&#8221; I am Just here to see why you wandered so far from that little clump of dust you call a world.&#8221; Was the reply, then continued. &#8220;You really have no idea what awaits you here, do you? All the dangers, maybe even your destiny. Though, somehow you are a little different than two other captains I have met. Why don&#8217;t I help you and send you home.&quot; &#8220;NO, we are here on a mission and don&#8217;t need you help.&#8221; I replied, my anger beginning to show. &#8220;Get off my ship and leave us alone.&#8221; &#8220;Oh you would like that wouldn&#8217;t you, never getting any help from me......&#8217; The being turned to face me.......it was........
