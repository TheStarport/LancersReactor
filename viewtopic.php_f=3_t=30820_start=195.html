			<div class="content">I have heard the GTA idea come up a couple times and i do like the idea in a way.  It would be cool if there was a bounty on my head the more enemies i made, the bigger the bounty.  Since most people became outlaws, it would be cool to walk into a bar and see a couple million credit bounty on my head.  Also, say if i became really hated by a country, if i went into there territory they would come after me with battle ships and other stuff.  What would be really cool is if i went to an open system like one of the sigma's and saw a huge force of all different kinds of battle ships from ever colony there.  Juni would try to get in touch with me and say that they finnally caught the famous bounty hunter and they courned him and ready to attack.  That would be really fun to fight my way out.  It would be nice to encorperate something like this into the freelancer too.  SHifting prolitical fractions were some get more powerful then others and overtake them wouldn't be bad.</div>

			<div class="content">It would be better if you could make like career paths politicans can rise to power(own navies or &quot;sadie&quot; buiesness) or become a pirate start with the Corsairs Lane Hackers Rogues Red Hessians  GC Blood Dragons Bunchuh or even create your own faction such as the Raiders or make the oppisite like a Navy where you can buy battle ships or make them your self in ship yards in your own system,say you beocme owner of any of the 4 houses then you would control those shipyards or go the hard way and make 1 from scratch in the system of your choosing like one in New York system in a debris feild beyond libery patrol.then we could have the merchants adventure where you can become a rich merchant trade fleet owner meaning cruisers that protect your larger than large train tranports from pirate attacks or a enemy company who wants to try and take you out.When you first start out youll only have a few 1 man fighters to defend each transport but when you grow and manage to buy ships yards yuoll be able to upgrade to light cruisers then maybe even a dreadnaught guarding them with a compliment of fighters also for defence.If you own shipyards they can also make better fighters for the smaller convoys and upgrading the convoys defences or just giving the trains them selfs sheilds increased armor plating or more attachable train sections for lager loads but adding something new would change the abilites of that vehicle say you make it all engine then the storage would be smaller but it would make get aways easier or if you gave it larger room then it would turn into a tub filled with rocks in it.If you realy got big into shipping you could upgrade your ships into cruisers with less defences(not much) but the cargo holds would make anyone shiver.During deliveries you could into battles where you can order your cruiser or fighters to defend that flank or the front of the fleet or fomr the back of it maybe even make a few of the scout ships to give you warning of coming attacks ahead of you which would give your convoy a stronger chance to survive in the border worlds.With shipyards come patince you have to hire poeple to wokr in there the better trained they when hired the better the final product is but everytime you complete a ship cruiser exct... they earn expirence and become more seasoned in what you hired them for and the next craft is better than the last.You could even hire scientiests to create defense platforms for the shipyards your bases or even the get a contract fomr say liberty space and they ask for 20 medium strenght defence platforms for a border stantions and shipyards or tradelanes near the badlands.If you get realy good ships you can direct your scientists to improve upon that idea there making a better ship or amking it pump out that piece of equipment to give you that edge you need against say the ever changing and evolving corsairs who always seem to get the edge on you. Anyway i hope a designer might get some ideas fomr this and make some nice mod for the current freelancer but if you do please could you give credit to me or any other person who gave you the idea.All in all i say lets breath life into a new freelancer <img src=smilies/icon_smile_approve.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Proper physics is all well and good but..
<br />
<br />- Speeds would be fantastic.  There would be no way of interacting with the
<br />vast majority of the ships you saw, because they would flash past in an 
<br />instant.  All of the action would have to happen close to stations.
<br />
<br />- Most of the time, every other ship or object in the game would be a dot.  It
<br />is around 300,000 miles just from Earth to the Moon - and if we say that 
<br />a spoaceship turns into a dot at 300 miles distance, that means that the system maps would be huge, but 99.99% empty.
<br />
<br />- Deceleration would be a huge problem.  5 seconds late and you'd be *splat*
<br />straight into a planet.  5 seconds early and you still end up miles away. 
<br />With a solar system like ours, you would be looking
<br />at fantastic distances between 'interesting' objects, and hence you would 
<br />need fantastic speeds to get anywhere.  
<br />
<br />Trust me, it would take the fun out of it..  Personally I think it's been done 
<br />in freelancer really well.  There is the impression of being in space without
<br />the inconvienient reality.</div>

			<div class="content">Freelancer 2 could do with some tweaks to game style.
<br />For instance, the story line is, fundamentally, about 
<br />making a difference (or a contribution) to Sirius. But once
<br />the story is over, there not much difference to be made anymore.
<br />There's no end to Liberty Rogues or Xenos, and it doesn't
<br />matter how many diamonds you deliver to Manhattan, the
<br />demand doesn't change.
<br />
<br />  Making a difference is closely related to a more realistic
<br />economy (demand and supply), but it reappears in several
<br />other places.
<br />
<br />  Reputation building  needs an overhaul.  Delivering
<br />commodities (in particular needed commodities like
<br />oxygen to space stations) should help change reputation.
<br />This would also help making trading a more interesting
<br />activity, particularly if the trader had some extra tools
<br />of the trade, for instance an autopilot that doesn't need
<br />to be told to go on to the next waypoint ... 
<br />
<br />  Individual reputation would  be interesting: a
<br />huge, timely delivery of oxygen might make you at least
<br />a neutral party in some places ... for a while. If commodity
<br />prices were related to reputation, which doesn't seem altogether
<br />impossible, reputation tweaking could also make sense, also
<br />in a larger perspective: if your faction carries a lot
<br />of, say, light arms from Trenton, getting more friendly with
<br />Universal is economically sound. And that may be another kind of
<br />difference on a more global scale.
<br />
<br />  Yet another kind of difference is the game infrastructure
<br />itself: I find it somewhat odd to have the same spoken accent
<br />all over Sirius. Recording everything in different dialects would
<br />make the game too expensive: this might be one of those things
<br />that could be left to the fan base -- it's just that the game
<br />infrastructure must be prepared to accomodate 200+ different 
<br />forms of gretings instead of just five or six, and that takes another
<br />kind of game design.</div>

			<div class="content">What about the idea of Trent having to find the Don Kavosh to get htem to help Sirius against the Nomads. This could evolve into my idea that the Nomads were created by the Don Kavosh to keep things in order. But the Nomads rebelled and a huge war occured. The Don Kavosh had no choise but to place the Nomads under the crust of a planet, then fled from Sirius. Trent would have to find the Don Kavosh and get their help to stop the Nomads. 
<br />
<br />And also, it would be soooooo cool if the Order had a fleet, not a base but a FLEET, consisting of battleships, cruisers and gunboats!</div>

			<div class="content">The way the intro puts it in the first game, there's got to be a time when the people of sirius decide to go back and claim their homeland. I think a good way to go with FL2 is that you start off being able to join any faction, with multiple storylines, but they all ultimately result in all of sirius going back to earth to throw down the coalition. That way everyone can really go about the game in a different way from the start but end up with the same goal.
<br />
<br />Just a thought though, id imagine that would be pretty complicated to do.

			<div class="content">1st. U should put the buing station seection in the most players wantend part. In freelancer u should be able to create ur own &quot;Empire&quot; u choose trading, pirating or bounty hunters... Like X2 the threat u should be able to allocate ur own convoys and foghters and stations.
<br />
<br />2nd. The economic system should be more sophisticated... Like different currencies in the different countries... or u should be able to take loans.
<br />
<br />3rd. U should be able to create ur own ships, guns or missiles, with some restrictions of course.
<br />
<br />4th. if the planets are moving the trade lanes will be useless.
<br />
<br />5th. The storyline should have a better ending. Please destroing few stupid sattelites... U should be attacking ships in a HUGE WAR like the nomad leader or something.
<br />
<br />6th MANY and I mean MANY mini games... Races (with ships with different speeds and thrusters) and making bets on the racers... duels not only with players but with NPC's and again betting on them. 
<br />
<br />7th. U should be able to play  the single player storyline with other players (humans) like not more than 2 or 4...
<br />
<br />8th. U think of the next ones... <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />(edit)
<br />9th: Levels: Not only ur main rank... Real skills like piloting, charizma, Leadership, Mechanics, Tradeing skill ( took my enspiration form Space rangers) These skills could let u: Turn ur ship faster, make ur equipment break lesser if under fire, charge cruisers faster, make ur aim better, like auto aim, wich can be seen if u put ur cursor even near the cross, make the equipment prisez lower, even ur reputation could make equipment prises for u higher or lower. And leadership for the men u hired like how many or how good they can be. There can also be a mercs quarters on planets. Also Diplomacy skill to use when talking to npc pirates or stuf like that... what do u suggest and what are ur thoughts for my suggestions for the next game of the decade: FREELANCER II

			<div class="content">I would love to have a Energy Bar... Kinda like this:
<br />
<br />Guns                   : ---------------------
<br />Shield                 : ----------------------
<br />Life Support        : ------------------------
<br />Communication   : -------------------------
<br />Turning               : -----------------------
<br />Engine                 : ------------------------
<br />
<br />and u could drag the bars  ( : ---------------------- ) as u wanted it... u could live without Life Support for X amount of time,
<br />couldn't get any messages without Communication... Less communication, less briefing.. 
<br />Turning would be like hell if u didn't have it over normal..
<br />Engine = speed of course...
<br />and Shields.. like u take shields on max when going trough a gas field...
<br />
<br />AND! radiation... there should be some way to protect ur self from Radiation... 
<br />
<br />AND <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> u should be able to pay outcast or something to let u dock on station, fly through system without beeing attackt and stuff like that, without changing ur rep.. like, just for 10 mins of something... 
<br />
<br />Gotta admitt.. i love the idees many of u got... GTA mod! YEAH! <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
