<br />Others have said this too. It inevitably gets used for cheating and getting people booted and banned from servers. 
<br />Nickless put it<font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade> The thing is, there was one guy who made a cloakmod, but then everyone started using it on every server and basically cheated with it.
<br />Becuase the cloak isn't part of the original game in terms of usable stuff, it's realy easy to use it as a cheat. This is why the cloak is banned. We're all just as curious as you are about how it would be if we're cloaked, but it's just something we're gonna have to live with untill MS comes up with a FL game with a cloak.
<br />
<br />The reason people act like this is because for a long time there have been numerous posts by people requesting the cloak mod. They all say they wont be using it online as a cheat, but experiance has proven otherwise. This doesn't mean we don't trust you or that we don't like you, we're just staying on the save side by not giving anyone the cloak mod.
<br />
<br />Unless somebody comes up with a cheat-prove cloakmod (wich wont happen) there will be no cloak mod on this site (and many others) for download.
<br />It's just one of those things... <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />This is by Chips, A mod maker and friend -<font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Datastorm tells you the location of things, it doesn't present you (online only) with the chance to sit at 5k and blast away at all and sundry emerging from the docking rings...........without them seeing you on radar.
<br />
<br />Put it this way, The first time i saw the cloak was on Calgary, WAY before Wassup released the same cloak........and indeed whilst everyone here was proclaming it impossible too , which everyone immediately rubbished the claims it was possible. It was the server admin (where the cloak was gotten from by someone and then released ). HOwever, people used to sit round manhatten, and rumours of the &quot;boogeyman&quot; were funny - when poeple just exploded for no reason. No shield failure, they just exploded. Now thats two of the most destructive three cheats available.....he also had the uber hull.
<br />
<br />Luckily the admin was nice, and sat there wasting modders and dock campers/newb killers in NY. HOwever, that is the ONLY time i have ever seen it put to good use..............
<br />
<br />After he left, the server was what many became - a minefield of if you could survive launching from manhatten - i was okay (i could cheat), but many many many many many poeple actaully ended up leaving servers due to blowing up EVERY time they undock. The sadistic idiot sat cloaked and killing LOVED the swearing and cursing that poeple used, they found it hilarious, and nothing was better than sitting for up to 4 hours a day blasting everything that came on the server. 
<br />
<br />So - its not at all like datastorm. Datastorm ruins your own game because you don't have to search for anything. The cloak doesn't ruin your own game, it ruins anyone elses instead...........
<br />
<br />Now some say that they would never abuse it, well - its kind of like the old catch 22 situation. Until you have the power, you can never comment on it, and that is what the cloak was - power. You would use it in defense as someone killed you, then they might dock camp you.....before you know it, your sat at the docking ring blasting them into oblivion 20times in a row.......as well as their chums who come to help out. You find it sooooo poetic that his cries of mercy are met by your laser blasts which obliterate him.............you have become antoher arsehole.
<br />
<br />So there you go, even good poeple turn bad when they get that, and trust me - they do. Its also like Nuclear knowledge, the more that know it, the more likely it is to fall into the wrong hands. You might not guard it so closely as those that know, and therefore it slips to someone who you &quot;trust&quot; - but ultimately they only wanted the cloak (trust me, you get soooo many best new friends on servers and constant begging for it). You will pass it onto a friend, cause you don't want to be such a git to them - and then it starts to propogate, and before you know it - carnage on servers.
<br />
<br />All in perspective, it was THE most single DAMAGING mod ever made. For about four months it totally trashed MP games all over. You think i am being melodramatic? trust me, some servers were minefields, others had active admin who did the banning, BUT WHY should we make their jobs harder?  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Hope this explains it a bit more for you <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">i understand why u dont give it out but i only cheat when experimenting on my own comp mp when not online, imo there is no need to cheat if u have pvp duels because thats exciting enough and if u do cheat in a pvp its the cheat that won the duel not the player
<br />
<br />thats why in Jedi Academy i can say that for about 3 months before i got bored of the yawers i was never beaten by a player, just the amount of yaw they used</div>
