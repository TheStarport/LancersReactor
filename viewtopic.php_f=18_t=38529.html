			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p29023" class="post-subject">The &quot;Losing unmounted items&quot; problem in Freelancer</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">People have regularly reported unmounted items disappearing when a player has a large number of unmounted items - cargo, ammunition, batteries, nanobots, and spare equipment such as guns and turrets. I spent a couple of days investigating this and believe I can provide a fairly precise description of the real underlying problem. Due to length, I'm posting some possible ways to help the problem as a followup.
<br />
<br /><b>Summary Probable Description of the Problem </b>
<br />Freelancer keeps a list of all of a pilot's &quot;distinct items&quot;. The list can only contain 256 items, and if this length is exceeded the game may crash. I'm not completely clear on why certain items disappear in different scenarios, but I suspect that the net loss is based on the &quot;death penalty&quot; configured in freelancer.ini in the [Server section.
<br />
<br /><b>How Freelancer Counts &quot;Distinct Items&quot; </b>
<br />Although it's not easy to access the possessions of a pilot &quot;dynamically&quot; - between points when the game is saved to a file - you CAN see the last saved possessions as Freelancer counts them by looking at a decoded .FL file. If you add up the number of lines starting with
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;
<br />	ship_archetype =
<br />	equip =
<br />	cargo =
<br /> &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />you will get the count.
<br />
<br />Here's an example. The following lines are from a decoded copy of the &quot;vanilla&quot; newplayer.fl file:
<br />
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;
<br />ship_archetype = ge_fighter
<br />
<br />equip = ge_gf1_engine_01
<br />equip = ge_fighter_power01
<br />equip = ge_s_scanner_01
<br />equip = ge_s_tractor_01
<br />equip = LargeWhiteSpecial, HpHeadlight
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight01
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight02
<br />equip = SlowSmallOrange, HpRunningLight05
<br />equip = contrail01, HpContrail01
<br />equip = contrail01, HpContrail02
<br />equip = DockingLightRedSmall, HpDockLight01
<br />equip = DockingLightRedSmall, HpDockLight02
<br />
<br />equip = shield01_mark01_lf, HpShield01
<br />equip = li_gun01_mark01, HpWeapon01
<br />equip = li_gun01_mark01, HpWeapon02
<br />equip = ge_s_cm_01, HpCM01
<br />
<br />cargo = ge_s_cm_01_ammo, 20
<br />cargo = ge_s_battery_01, 10
<br />cargo = ge_s_repair_01, 10
<br /> &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />This contains a total of 20 separate items. Notice some important things here:
<br />
<br />+ Possessions that you cannot see obviously do count. In the standard game, contrails, engines, power plants, scanners, and tractors are not visible. So the first 12 items above count towards your total possessions, along with following 4 mounted items.
<br />
<br />+ STACKED items - for example, the 20 units of countermeasure ammo - count as a single distinct possession.
<br />
<br />+ UNSTACKED items, even with the SAME identity, count as &quot;distinct items&quot;. So items such as unequipped guns that are normally added as single items each count separately. Again, &quot;distinct items&quot; comes down to just counting lines. So the following 2 unequipped Justice Mark 1 guns count as 2 more items:
<br />
<br />&lt;pre&gt;&lt;font size=1 face=Courier&gt;
<br />cargo = li_gun01_mark01, 1
<br />cargo = li_gun01_mark01, 1
<br /> &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
<br />
<br />This is enough information to answer some important questions about item management.
<br />
<br /><b>How Many Visible Distinct Items Can A Pilot Have? </b>
<br />
<br />There is no way to automatically know in-game. If we subtract the ship itself, we're left with 255 item slots. Then, we have to subtract all invisible items such as (possibly) power plants, engines, tractor beams, contrails, and docking lights. These vary depending on both the mod and the particular ship. As a rule of thumb, probably a number in the range of 180-200 would work.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there's no way for a player to directly &quot;count&quot; the items easily. When someone is nearing the limit, they usually have large, poorly-sorted lists and may easily lose count as they flip between inventory screens.</div>

			<div class="content"><b>How Can The Problems Be Resolved Or Reduced?  </b>
<br />
<br />This second post discusses some possible strategies for reducing item loss instances. Following is a short list of ones which have occurred to me; how possible they are varies. None is a &quot;magic bullet&quot; that will resolve the problem entirely, but some are quite possible. I suspect the best 2 solutions are (3) and (5).
<br />
<br />(1) Minimize &quot;Invisible Item&quot; Loadouts 
<br />If extra items are used in ship loadouts, minimizing them may be very helpful. In other words, although a ship may have 10 RunningLight mountpoints, if only 4 are used in the loadout, the player's distinct item list won't contain the eliminated 6 lights.
<br />This won't help a lot for players who are near the limits; it will only stave off disaster.
<br />
<br />(2) Make &quot;Invisible Items&quot; Visible 
<br />Making items such as the ship running lights VISIBLE and potentially unmountable is an interesting angle. This allows players to both include them in their count (if they have the patience) and possibly REMOVE them. It also would allow a new category of customizations.
<br />I don't know whether this is even possible, unfortunately; presumably it would require some extensive modding like that done to make power plants visible and buyable/sellable.
<br /><i>Edit: Note CoolBeano's response below: lights are apparently NOT possible to make &quot;visible&quot;. </i>
<br />
<br />(3) Give Players Item Counts 
<br />We could also let players know how many items they currently have. This is promising, because we already have a populat tool that audits all player files, flstat. A minor change to flstat could add an items column to the web output, allowing players to simply look at the flstat page to see their last known count. The flstat pages are usually a few hours old, but since players take TIME to get to a large number of items, this won't be a big deal.
<br />
<br />(4) Stacking Items (has problems!) 
<br />Stacked items, as we know, only count as a single distinct item in the list. In theory, an flstat-like program that reads all player files during a server restart and then rewrites them could look for &quot;identical&quot; unmounted items (looking only at equip = lines) and then &quot;stack&quot; them into a single unit. When players trade items they will then be prompted for how many they should pass over.
<br />This is NOT GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA. The reason is that if the player has, say, 10 Salamanca II's in a stack he can't tell how many he has without attempting a trade; and if he mounts them, 5 of them will disappear!
<br />The stacking is still a good strategy for admin ships that sell special items, of course.
<br />
<br />(5) Specialty Vault Ships 
<br />The Asgard RPG Server (see the <a href='http://www.gamer-forums.com/asgard' Target=_Blank>Asgard Forums</a> for more information about Asgard) allows players to create a special character whose name is prefixed with [VAULT. This vault ship is given an uber shield and is NOT allowed to mount any weapons.
<br />This suggests another approach that might work well on multiplayer servers that encourage storage. Here's how it would work.
<br />(1) We begin with a custom vault ship design. The ship is not allowed to mount any weapons, and thus has no weapon/CM/mine/torpedo hardpoints. To give it everything it absolutely needs for movement and also some basic visual cues, it would have 9 hardpoints, one each for engine, shield, power plant, scanner, tractor, headlight, running light, contrail, and dock light.
<br />This ships would thus be able to hold exactly 246 distinct items. If we eliminated the lights completely, then we could increase this to 250 distinct items; I would favor a &quot;design&quot; that provides the lights at least since individual servers could simply remove them from the loadout. Players would be able to know precisely how many items could be stored in the ship.
<br />This would also allow &quot;safe&quot; use of stacking. By inspecting  the ship archetype, a program could automatically perform stacking ONLY on pilots with this custom ship. There would be no risk of loss by accidental mounting; it WOULD be necessary to unstack weapons when transferring them.
<br />
<br />As far as I can tell, there is no obvious way to eliminate the problem at this point. Even if there were, it would leave us with the more fundamental problem of managing all that material. However, it looks like there are some decent possible strategies for more precisely defining when people are in danger of loss and letting them know about it.

			<div class="content">A very interesting notion. I've noticed servers warning on a 100 - 120 item limit. Perhaps a program to test for over 220 items in general then find a way to tell the player... email via forum registration could be rather complicated... no idea how to make dynamic messages from console to individual or even if may be possible... just thinking on a keyboard really...

<br />*edit - remembers what was written about flstat and warnings on that... doh.

			<div class="content">A short contribution:
<br />
<br />I once saw an account folder with 5 .fl files.
<br />now, there was one weaponchar among these that caused a servercrash when joining.
<br />the 4 other normal chars worked, as i can remember...
<br />
<br />now if you deleted some of the normal chars, the weapon char would work too, no more servercrashes...
<br />maybe there is a account-wide limit for those distinct items...</div>

			<div class="content">After reading the responses so far, I wanted to make a few new comments.
<br />
<br />+ I integrated CoolBeano's comment about lights NOT being possible to make visible as far as we know into the original suggestions post.
<br />
<br />+ The IFSO integration idea is interesting. It's not really possible to do <i>directly </i> as far as I can see since IFSO is neither extensible nor exposed to external automation. Still, a good wrapper routine for fladmin.dll that exposes it to easy automation could make this possible automatically. It would simply have to scan &quot;new&quot; fl files, and since they appear to be temporarily written to the root of the Multiplayer folder as &quot;temp.fl&quot; files, this might be feasible.
<br />A really interesting long range idea that is very possible with the right knowledge is to expose the files to restricted web-based modification by the end users. The interface and controllability would be very important, but a minimalist web server running on the Freelancer server could do it. 
<br />
<br />+ w0dk4, if you recalled all the details correctly, that may be a more subtle problem since the all-pilots item count in the folder would be the same no matter which pilot is opened. Maybe that was an issue with the &quot;name&quot; file?</div>
