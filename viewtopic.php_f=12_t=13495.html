			<div class="content">I just got this from a friend on AIM, i kind of liked it, its long, but apparently (according to him) its true. Long read, enjoy
<br />
<br />Jenny was so happy about the house they had found. For once in her life 'twas on the right side of town. She unpacked her things with such great ease. As she watched her new curtains blow in the breeze. How wonderful it was to have her own room. School would be starting; she'd have friends over soon. There'd be sleep-overs, and parties; she was so happy It's just the way she wanted her life to be. On the first day of school, everything went great. She made new friends and even got a date! She thought, &quot;I want to be popular and I'm going to be, Because I just got a date with the star of the team!&quot; To be known in this school you had to have clout, And dating this guy would sure help her out. There was only one problem stopping her fate. Her parents had said she was too young to date. &quot;Well I just won't tell them the entire truth. They won't know the difference; what's there to lose?&quot; Jenny asked to stay with her friends that night. Her parents frowned but said, &quot;All right.&quot; Excited, she got ready for the big event But as she rushed around like she had no sense, She began to feel guilty about all the lies, But what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride? Well the pizza was good, and the party was great, But the moonlight ride would have to wait. For Dan was half drunk by this time. But he kissed her and said that he was just fine. Then the room filled with smoked and Dan took a puff. Jenny couldn't believe he was smoking that stuff. Now Dan was ready to ride to the point But only after he'd smoked another joint. They jumped in the car for the moonlight ride, Not thinking that he was too drunk to drive. They finally made it to the point at last, And Dan started trying to make a pass. A pass is not what Jenny wanted at all (and by a pass, I don't mean playing football.) &quot;Perhaps my parents were right....maybe I am too young. Boy, how could I ever, ever be so dumb.&quot; With all of her might, she pushed Dan away: &quot;Please take me home, I don't want to stay.&quot; Dan cranked up the engine and floored the gas. In a matter of seconds they were going too fast. As Dan drove on in a fit of wild anger, Jenny knew that her life was in danger. She begged and pleaded for him to slow down, But he just got faster as they neared the town. &quot;Just let me get home! I'll confess that I lied. I really went out for a moonlight ride.&quot; Then all of a sudden, she saw a big flash. &quot;Oh God, Please help us! We're going to crash!&quot; She doesn't remember the force of impact. Just that everything all of a sudden went black. She felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble, And heard, &quot;call an ambulance! These kids are in trouble! Voices she heard...a few words at best. But she knew there were two cars involved in the wreck. Then wondered to herself if Dan was all right, And if the people in the other car was alive. She awoke in the hospital to faces so sad. &quot;You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad.&quot; These voices echoed inside her head, As they gently told her that Dan was dead. They said &quot;Jenny, we've done all we can do. But it looks as if we'll lose you too.&quot; &quot;But the people in the other car!?&quot; Jenny cried. &quot;We're sorry, Jenny, they also died.&quot; Jenny prayed, &quot;God, forgive me for what I've done I only wanted to have just one night of fun.&quot; &quot;Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim, And wish I could return their families to them.&quot; &quot;Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied, And that it's my fault so many have died. Oh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for me?&quot; The nurse just stood there-she never agreed. But took Jenny's hand with tears in her eyes. And a few moments later Jenny died. A man asked the nurse, &quot;Why didn't you do your best To bid that girl her one last request?&quot; She looked at the man with eyes so sad. &quot;Because the people in the other car were her mom and dad.&quot; This story is sad and unpleasant but true, So young people take heed, it could have been you.</div>

The most distubing part of this is that they told her she was going to die and there was nothing they could do, just IMAGINE what that would be like.

<br />
<br />no matter how many times you pound these inspiring stories into the heads of teens, they are gunna do it anyway. i believe it applies to the rebellion principle.
<br />what's the first thing you want to do when when someone tells you &quot;NO. you can't do that!&quot;? you wanna do it!
<br />teens are well educated as to the facts of drugs and alcohol and their effect on the human body. i'd like to tell you how many times at school i was instructed on these things, but i've run out of fingers and toes to count on.... lousy math skills <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> (if anyone who reads this is from ontario, you'll get the last statement <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />it all boils down to &quot;you can't teach common sense&quot;
<br />if you're drunk. don't drive... hmm if only it were that simple
<br />
<br /> ...Just a random thought from a random mind</div>

			<div class="content">actually i got it from one of these girls i know in real life over email with a entry like &quot;hey! check this article out i just found on the net, i found it quite sad&quot; but i know her on AIM and in Real Life so i could trust her with email, after which i read it, not, unlike what you think, i wasnt asked to mail it to anyone else, and yes, i know what chain letters are, btw, thats a AWESOME urban legends site after i clicked your GLURGE link i spent like 3 hours at Snopes reading stuff. Awesome site, anyway, enjoy the paragraph, and dont think of it in the wrong way, im a teen too (19) so i know what it feels like to have castes of what it &quot;supposed&quot; to be like every waking moment, nonetheless, i also know some people who do that stuff and think that its ok, as long as they dont drive doing it, but who am i kidding, pfffttt like i was ever a designated driver anyway
<br />
<br />PS: heed my warning all careless teens out in the world, getting drunk and driving can lead to bad results such as spilling your beer all over yourself. For people who smoke reefer, if someone tells you look funny when your high, by god put your experimental skills to use! (it sure came in handy that one crazy night on spring break......but well cover that later) go smoke a j and look at your friends, aha! they DO look funny!

<br />Can't help being sceptical - I heard similar would-be true stories so many times from different people (mostly some Jehova witnesses etc.) who seem to enjoy preaching. Had hard time kicking them off.
<br />Speaking of youth, the only way to prevent them from doing stupid things, IMHO, is through inducing fear and exercising strict control (e.g. in my country they are working on the law forbidding teenagers to walk on the streets after 22:00).

			<div class="content">ohh..so sad...what a darn sad story and all of you goes about flaming teenagers.
<br />
<br />Who was Dan's driving instructor? Should kill him...
<br />
<br />They must be living in a stupid country with stupid road rules and stupid driving license with stupid dark roads and stupid road signs and stupid enforcement and stupid blind turns (these should only happen in MY country...)
<br />
<br />Dan must be stupid too to drive so fast in an unfamiliar road.
<br />He is also very stupid to drive while he's drunk.
<br />
<br />And Jenny...man, what a piece of crap. Sitting in the passenger seat with a drunk driver. God, how can anybody be so stupid?. Get a taxi for God sake!..
<br />
<br />I think she deserve to die for being really stupid.
<br />
<br />And her parents. Well, driving at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
<br />
<br />But seriously, the only way Dan could have hit her parent this hard (given the bright flash of lights) was to drive on the wrong side of the road. Her parents must be one monotonous couple. 
<br />
<br />Mom : Look dear, there's someone speeding on the wrong side of the road.
<br />Dad : Maybe he'll clear off. Lets just drive as if nothing going to happen
<br />Mom : No dear, he is still driving on the road side of the road. Maybe you should warn him
<br />Dad : Maybe I try honking.... That didn't work. What if I flash my lights? Maybe that can do something..
<br />
<br />Dan : ARRGHH!! What was that light? I can see? Shut up Jenny, I can see a thing on road. Would you shut the f*** up!.... I know what I'm doing...ARRGGHH!!
<br />
<br />CRASH!!
<br />
<br />If Dan was driving too fast on a crazy blind bending road, he would have driven the car off the road in the first place..
<br />
<br />This story is not even logic at all... Moral of the story is, don't drink and drive. Not all teenagers and stupid and we should lock them all up in the prison. Teenagers do stupid things because their parent never prepare them and teach them about responsibilities(because their parents and their parent's parent are stupid..)
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry if my post sort of hurt someone's feelings...but...wait the minute. I don't care what you all feel anyway....What I really hope is that I don't get banned from this place cause it is rather usefull..(in terms of Freelancer)
<br />
<br />
<br />Hit your enemy when they are down
<br />Hit your enemy when they surrender
<br />Hit your enemy when they can't fight no more</div>

			<div class="content">Here's a happier glurge (once again supposedly a true story)
<br />
<br />I read recently the story of a 10-year-old boy who decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident.
<br />
<br />The boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three months of training, the master had taught him only one move.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sensei,&quot; the boy finally said, &quot;Shouldn't I be learning more moves?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,&quot; the sensei replied. Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training.
<br />
<br />Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match.
<br />
<br />Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals. This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened. &quot;No,&quot; the sensei insisted, &quot;Let him continue.&quot;
<br />
<br />Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament. He was the champion.
<br />
<br />On the way home, the boy and the sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind: &quot;Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You won for two reasons,&quot; the sensei answered. &quot;First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defence for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.&quot;
<br />
<br />The boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.
<br />
<br />*************now for the spoiler**********
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I have been doing Judo for the last seven years yet i've never come across this incredible throw with only one defence! If anyone else here knows it please enlighten me!</div>

			<div class="content">hmm, wow, that is awesome, yeah, the left arm is a very important defensive purpose, but its judo, i wouldnt know much about that, i have a first degree black in Shantung Black Tiger Wushu, im aiming for third degree, thats as far as i want to go, once i signed up i recieved a book which says it requires 15+ years of trainig to recieve a Sixth degree black belt. after which, i thought i dont want to spend 15 years of my life training. But nonetheless, wushu is mostly riposites so i wouldnt be sure if in judo that move really cant be defended against.</div>

			<div class="content">ah, i just realized, i dont think that glurge is completely true, the guy could have massacred the kid by the time he gets his one move in. But maybe he feels pity for him and doesnt want to hit him hard or something, in any case, i still dont think its completely true, its very hard to block with one hand and even if it was possible the kid with one hand, as you said moved up pretty quickly, by his final match he would be fighting a Judo master, in truth the person with one hand, if he even tried to block would tire quickly, and if not, being a high ranking student the other person would have found a way around, im thinking this isnt really true, but it may just be, not sure really
<br />
<br />PS: i know this has nothing to do with the story, but i have heard of a type of strongmans attack, a severe blow to the heart can actually make it stop beating (in turn killing the person)
