			<div class="content">interesting thread, should bring out all the attention seeking hypochondriacs like ME!
<br />
<br />ok its story time again..
<br />
<br />about 10yrs ago i was working away from home and was having really bad toothache, so after a few weeks i went to a local dentist and had an exam and he told me i needed RCT. a week later i had the work done, he said i had to come back a couple more times before it was finished, take these antibios every day. ok went back a couple of weeks later, had some more done, went away. went to a part t a nightclub and started feeling really ill, went home. still ill until one day i forgot to take the antibios and started feeling better. thought i wouldnt bother taking them anymore, anyway went out a few more times and one morning forgot to go to dentists appt. a few days later started feeling ill again but shook it off, forgot to remake dentists appt (so work never got finished) then for next couple of months went thru days of feeling fine to days of feeling like i had flu and migraine together. up and down, stopped eating regularly, weight started coming off me, started having hot sweats but felt freezing cold. still had odd days of feeling ok but def. was not good, people started commenting that i was looking yellow!
<br />
<br />eventually got so ill and had to pack in work, needed somewhere to rest, went to my parents near Burnley as they were only 50miles away. had fevers that night and started hallucinating. doctor came up and said i needed to get in the hospital straight away. i dont even remember going to the hospital i was so far gone, everything was like a nightmare i was being carried along in, i only remember falling onto a bed and my father trying to tell the nurse i was a catholic to which i was protesting) the NEXT thing i remember is waking up with tubes all in me in a sterile room, thinking what the f***? then some nurse greets me and says its 4 days later. then i mustv flaked again because next it was saturday and theres me mam and dad at the side of the bed. mothers wittering away crying and stuff, and eventually from them and the nurses and some doctor i find out i've got this cardiac infection thats eating away the inside of my heart! 'KIN HELL! u wot? i totally freaked.. then realised i was so weak and stiff i couldn't hardly move. and i was screaming for a ciggie too. turns out they all reckoned i was going to die. like thats just great, i'm feeling better already <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />a few days later they tell me they reckon i'd contracted the streptococcus viridans bacterium from an infected tooth nerve, the name for what i had was Acute Bacterial Endocarditis supposedley, and had i had any dental treatment lately? err y but i stopped taking the antibios.. well that'll be it then m8! it figured! so the docs decided they were going to yank my teeth out. y like right i'm really going to let u! so they agreed just to pull 2 infected ones out. ok thats cool i could live with that.
<br />
<br />so they tell me they have to pump me full of IV focussed antibios before i can be taken to the dental hospital in Bury, and put me on this drip putting penicyllin and some other stuff into me. i'm sitting down having a rest and start feeling really hot and itchy. the chap next to me looks at me in horror and says that my eyes are sticking out of my head and i'm turning purple! i get up to have a look, fall on the floor and went into convulsions. i was allergic to the penicillin see? which was why the previous dental antibios had made me feel ill to start with. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh all made sense now while i was writhing around on the floor like a rabid dog, frothing at the mouth. it was a madhouse, theres nurses everywhere ripping drips out of me, holding me down and shoving wood into my gob so i wouldnt bite my tongue (bit like Kane's death in Alien i suppose!) and doctors trying to inject me with stuff to counteract the neat penicillin that was poisoning me. i started puking up blood and it was f***in horrible i can tell you.
<br />
<br />eventually they succeeded and i stopped writhing, i felt like sh*t and my brain was boiled. i started hallucinating again (u do when ur poisoned) and i saw people who were dead coming up to my bed as kids when i d known them years ago. errrrr thats weird.... anyway i was stuck in that hospital for a month before they let me out, thy must have taken enuff blood samples to reanimate Frankinstein, 6 syringfulls three times a day for 30days. what were they doing with it? making the hospital gravy?
<br />
<br />i did get excellent coverage of the 94 World Cup in the USA, as everyone else on the ward died (no kidding they all popped their clogs!) so after a couple of weeks i had the whole wing to myself. and near constant attention from the nurses. unfortunately i was getting very bored once the footie finished. i absconded from the hospital so i could go to the shops and got brought back by the Police.
<br />
<br />and if i so much as taste penicillin i will prob die! my wife keeps threatening to put it in my tea if i p*ss her off too much.

<br />Yeah, lets all learn from his mistakes! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />1. Don't get dental work done from a dodgy dentist.
<br />2. Know your allergies
<br />3. Don't get arrested in foreign countries (from a previous post by Taw)
<br />4. &lt;&lt;To be added&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Who wants to add to this list?  I'm sure there are other things we've seen on posts from Taw.
