			<div class="content">&#8220;More Meat!&#8221; yelled Johnny &#8220;More, More, More!&#8221;  The Male chef then said in a woman&#8217;s voice: &#8220;Johnny! Time to wake up!&#8221;  
<br />&#8220;Huh?!&#8221; exclaimed Johnny. Johnny found himself lying in bed, he realised that he had had the same dream that he had been having for the past three weeks! 
<br />
<br />Johnny was about ten years old, today was his first day back-at-school, and he had been dreading it, this was because he had bitten by something in his garden at night. He didn&#8217;t think he should go to school with it, but his mother insisted. He was so worried he would be bullied about it, as there was a big bandage round his hand.
<br />
<br />The first morning of school was ok, but a few people did call him &#8216;bandage hand&#8217;. He was now standing in the lunch line. Johnny&#8217;s stomach rumbled.
<br />&#8220;I sure hope there&#8217;s meat on the menu today!&#8221; exclaimed Johnny
<br />&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t that keen on meat Johnny&#8221; replied his friend Germaine. Johnny licked his lips. &#8220;Meat is one of the best foods ever!&#8221; yelled Johnny. There was silence in the dining hall, everyone was staring at Johnny. Mr Benson (the schools headmaster) approached Johnny. &#8220;Come with me&#8221; said Mr Benson firmly. Johnny followed Mr Benson into his office.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What were you thinking?&#8221; yelled Mr Benson at Johnny &#8220;The playgrounds for shouting not the dining hall!&#8221; Mr Benson kept a rabbit in his office called Fluffs. Johnny turned away from Mr Benson and approached Fluffs. &#8220;Look at me when I am talking to you, Johnny Ferret!&#8221; Mr Benson shouted across his office. Johnny approached Fluffs hutch. &#8220;Get away from there!&#8221;  Johnny opened the hutch door, and took out Mr Benson&#8217;s rabbit. Johnny opened his mouth wide, he was about to shove the whole rabbit in his mouth! He shook his head a few times; he looked and saw the rabbit in his hands. Johnny  quickly put Fluff&#8217;s back in his hutch and sat back down. Fluffs was shaking! &#8220; Please explain to me what all these shenanigans  are all about Johnny&#8221; said Mr Benson calmly &#8220;If you don&#8217;t stop I will have get the school psychiatrist in.&#8221; &#8220;No, no I am alright&#8221; replied Johnny Mr Benson asked Johnny if he was sure and he said yes. 
<br />
<br />Johnny was lying in bed, he was thinking about his uncontrollable actions at school today. Why was it happening, he thought. He then fell asleep. He woke up in the morning. He had had a different dream than usual, he had dreamt that he was howling at the moon. &#8220;Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!&#8221;  Johnny woke up with a jump. He realised that the screaming was not part of the dream. He saw his mother in the corner of the room, pointing and screaming at Johnny. He tried to ask his mother what&#8217;s wrong, but it just came out as a load of growls. His mother shot out the bedroom like a bullet. Johnny got out of bed and looked in the mirror, but when he looked in the mirror, he didn&#8217;t see ordinary Johnny Ferret, no he saw&#8230;&#8230;a wolf!</div>
