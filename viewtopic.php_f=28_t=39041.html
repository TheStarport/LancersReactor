			<div class="content">Me and my friend have been brainstorming and designing ships for an unnamed mod we wish to create. This mod is a conversion which puts you in an area of space where the Hispania crash landed. The story goes roughly as follows:
<br />
<br />In a cluster of habitable planets a few lights years from Sirius resides the stranded and alone Hispanian people, building up their empire with a few civil wars and changes of power in between. As ships became faster, Hispanians were able to explore the space around them, they soon began to realize that they weren't as alone as they thought. A scout vessel came across an alien planet, and the scout ship was quickly destroyed soon after transmitting its findings. This began the many wars between the Hispanian Empire and the Alien race (still to be named).
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, in the Sirius System, a joint science venture in the border worlds brought about an amazing discovery, a intermitant jumphole. The science team soon found themselves in contact with the Hispanian Empire, their long lost brothers. In the war torn Hispanian sector are many resource rich systems which presented a grand opportunity. The Hispanian government and the 4 major houses of Sirius came to a formal agreement that they would be allowed to enter Hispanian space and set up infrastructure and mining operations. In exchange, the houses would help repel the Alien foe. The science team soon realized a problem, which left them stranded for 20 years (debatable) in the Hispanian sector, the Jumphole to Sirius only remained phase aligned for 5 years, then they must wait another 20 years for another phase alignment.
<br />
<br />The science team was considered lost by the houses. To their surprise, 10 years after the declaration that the science team was lost, the team returned triumphantly with news of what they discovered. The houses quickly classified all information and kept the jumphole under raps in order to set up military efforts in Hispania and keep the resources for their own efforts. After 50 years of coverup, a cruise ship stumbled upon the jumphole and told Sirius of their findings, this is where the mod begins....
<br />
<br />Mod Features:
<br />There are a couple things we are changing that we didn't like about freelancer:
<br />- Capital ships cannot be destroyed easily by fighters, they will be meant mainly for capship to capship combat, we hated that one fighter could take out a capship, it makes them pointless.
<br />- Fighter combat will now be based on pilot skill, similar to freeworlds for those who have played it. No more level 10 weapons that do insane damage.
<br />
<br />Here are the following features of the mod:
<br />- Balanced fighters for all factions, with advantages and disadvantages, no more stupid powerful fighters.
<br />- Balanced weapons, with some new ones for Hispania and the Aliens
<br />- Liberty will have a gunboat
<br />- Cruise will be faster. Since Hispania was not part of Sirius from the beginning and do not have the infrastructure (ie Trade Lanes, Jump Gate in certain systems) cruise will be faster since most tradelanes will not be complete or there will be none at all. 4 Sirius houses will have a cruise of roughly 400-450, Hispania will have cruise of 550-600 (since they have dealt with little tradelanes longer) and the Aliens will have the fatest ships at a cruise of 800 (since they have no tradelanes at all)
<br />- Hispanian System will consist of roughly 20 systems (subject to change)
<br />- New ships for all factions
<br />- All lancer ships unlocked
<br />- New commodities
<br />- New station designs for Hispania and the Aliens
<br />
<br />Our radical idea:
<br />Sometimes it is annoying to swap characters for ships and such, we have an idea to actually have a player garage in which you will have one character but can store multiple ships at a certain location. We are still unsure how this will work or if it can.
<br />
<br />Server Side:
<br />During testing and first release this mod will be exclusive to the mod team server. We will consider requests to use the mod as they arise (this is subject to change).
<br />Our server will be an rpg style server, with factions and squads, fleets and the like.
<br />
<br />Help we need:
<br />- Someone who is good with milkshape to help me bloody well grasp it, or to model altogether
<br />- Brainstormers
<br />- Someone who can texture properly for lancer
<br />- Someone good at creating maps
<br />- Coding, Unlocking ships, creating new stuff etc.
<br />- Really everything to do with a mod
<br />
<br />Anyone with experience with this *cough* Chips *cough* please feel free to drop a line.
<br />
<br />If you have any comments, questions, critisism (yes we want some) or want to assist reply here or e-mail me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:outlaw14_ca@hotmail.com">outlaw14_ca@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->.

			<div class="content">Hi!
<br />
<br />The project sounds quite good, but I have some questions (Unfortunately I cannot help, as I'm working on my own mod):
<br />
<br />1. How do you do the different cruise speeds for the ships. Until now every modder was sure that cruise speed is the same for all ships and can only be changed for all ships. So, having the Hispania ships with a faster cruise speed would not be possible. Or did you found a way to have different cruise speeds? (The only thing I can immagine is to have no real cruisespeed, but just a high speed, with a negative value for reverse_fraction).
<br />
<br />2. I do not want to be rough, but as far as I know it will not be possible to have different ships for one player, which are stored in a garage. Many asked for this or also tried to do this, but I think this is hardcoded and you would need the sourcecode for this.
<br />
<br />So, I hope you will find some help here and I wish you good luck with your mod!
<br />
<br />Black Eagle

			<div class="content">The write up above is mainly ideas we have had for the mod, in which case the answers to your questions:
<br />
<br />1) We haven't had a chance or time to look at changing cruise speeds yet, so I'm not sure then if they can be changed per ship. Once we have looked into it more I will let you know.
<br />
<br />2) I didn't have high hopes about this one, considering how much is involved to make it work even if it was possible, we will look at it and maybe we will find a way.

			<h3><a href="#p367961" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Okay, I understand!
<br />
<br />But then, I think I have to disapoint you again. Many of the best modders looked into cruise speed, but as I said before found out that it is set only ONCE for ALL ships and cannot be altered for different ships. So, this is very probable not possible.
<br />The only other solution to get different &quot;travelling&quot; speeds would be the reverse_fraction I mentioned, but this is also not the perfect method, as Cruise speed would still be there (and the same for all ships) and the reverse_fraction editing would just add a second &quot;travelling&quot; speed, which can however be set for each ship.
<br />
<br />If you want to know more about this, just search the forums for reverse_fraction, or ask here and I will explain it to you.
<br />
<br />So, again, good luck! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Alright, I haven't looked much into the topic, but that makes sense. However the cruise speed will have to be increased because of the lack of trade lanes, so I will probably just set a standard for all ships that is fine, probably around 600-700, tradelanes still need to make sense to use. Or I could set cruise at 1000 and eliminate tradelanes altogether, but I'm trying to keep the freelancer elements somewhat.</div>

			<div class="content">Cruise speeds over 400 cause lag in MP- it has to do with the server-side prediction model used.  If you're making this for MP, keep that in mind.
<br />
<br />Instead of raising cruise speed or having Tradelanes, why not have a mod where everywhere you want to go between involved either traveling vast distances via Cruise or using a Jumpgate or a Jumphole?  That'd take care of your problems right there... dunno why people don't do it that way all of the time.  That way, you could have extra-cool stuff that was &quot;off the beaten path&quot;, because there wouldn't be a convenient Jump Gate... so, for example, players wanting to find the coolest Wrecks would have to spend 10 minutes in Cruise, get to a dangerous area full of asteroids, and then carefully search it to find the treasures.... etc.</div>
