			<div class="content">This begins at the same time as the beginning of the Kusari-Rheinland War in the game.  Its about a corsair conquistador, his passion for his country, his cunning in battle, but also his darker side and absolute cruelty to his enemies, a name which earned him the Iron Heart of Hispania.  Anyways part 1 isn't as good as I like, and if there are a bunch of typo's I'm sorry, I'm taking a pretty powerful anti-cough syrup for pneumonia so I'm kind of &#8220;out there&#8221; as it were right now.
<br />
<br />Introduction:
<br />
<br />A young hispanian pilot walked into the tavern on Portugal Station, its previous name, Freeport 9, but that was a half century ago.  He sat down at the counter next to an old man, he had come since he was a child listening to this man tell stories, for he had served on the <i>Prometheus </i> and with its commander Fernando Gonzalez better known as Coraz&#243;n Del Hierro or the Iron Heart.  He sat down as the man was already into one of his tales with some of the other customers and didn't want to disturb him. 
<br />
<br />The Legend of Fernando Coraz&#243;n Del Hierro,  Part 1
<br />
<br />Fernando Gonzalez sat on the bridge in his command chair of the newly comissioned battleship <i>Prometheus </i>, named after the titan who gave man the first knowledge of fire.  The warship was smaller and much more manuverable than its house counterparts.  He took a long inhale on his cigar, then exhaled.  The vessel was sporting its newly designed capital ship cruise engine allowing it to cruise at nearly 120 space units comfortably.  The vessels newly developed long range sensors were probing the Omicron Theta system which they had just entered.  The Promtheus's task, search for an enemy base, capture it and use it as a staging point for other operations.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Capit&#225;n, we have detected a freeport, 2 astronomical units from here.&#8221; the radar officer said.  Fernando smiled quite broadly as he stroked his black beard with some streaks of grey in it.    &#8220;Head towards that signal helmsman, tell the fighter pilots to get to their ships, eta till destination and when are we going to be in sensor range for knowing enemy numbers.&#8221; Fernando replied.  &#8220;10 minutes to the former and 8 minutes for the latter sir.&#8221;  responded the radar officer.
<br />
<br />The vessel Prometheus had been commissioned several weeks ago, the first non-house built battleship and the first of the Corsairs ever.  It was deadly carrying 2 main guns (a modified array of smaller salamanca mark II firelinked to be almost as strong large house guns), 2 torpedo tubes, and 6 missile launchers carrying deadly firestalkers and had a carrier capacity of 4 starfighter wings. Topping it off, the vessel's armor had multiple nanobot storage spots along the hull to allow for fast repair.  Now this weapon of war was about to be deployed against the Bounty Hunters and the Zoners.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir were in-range of weapons, combat range is 120 seconds, registry reports this to be freeport 9, zoner owned, detecting 1 heavily armed station, 6 Bounty Hunter Hammerhead Wings, 2 Zoner Eagle Wing.  I've already informed the squadron commander&#8221; said the radar officer.  &#8220;Excellent.  Tell him to launch immediately.&#8221; Fernando ordered.
<br />
<br />Commander Horatio Cortez sat in his Titan Command Type fighter, a slight modification the normal Titan, with much more command and control systems.  He had just recived a transmission to deploy, his forces immediatly.  He sent a transmission back, &#8220;Ci Capit&#225;n, we are launching as soon as the ship exits cruise speed.&#8221; he replied back to the bridge.  He looked at the force list, 2 to 1, there could be casualties,  but they were corsairs, they had always been outnumbered, and they had always survived and been the greatest pirate organization in Siruis.  He felt a slight twist in his stomach as he new the <i>Prometheus </i> had dropped out of cruise speed.  A green light activated on the launch bay doors. &#8220;This is it amigos, a new era, today Hispania begins its formation, victory to the Corsairs!&#8221; he said to all his pilots.  The Prometheus two launch bay doors openned in the rear and on the bottom, eight Titan's streamed from each their guns engaging the fighters as the <i>Prometheus's </i> capital ship guns and torpedos began taking out the stations turrets and punching holes in the docking back bulkheads for boarding in a brilliant display of orange laser bolts and azure torpedos.

			<div class="content">The fighters on both sides swarmed around the station and battleship at high speed firing at one another.  Cortez manuvered his fighter around the rear of the <i>Prometheus </i> coming straight in on the rear of an eagle at near point blank range, he quickly dumbfired a trio of hellstalkers causing its shields to seemingly burst like a bubble as he did precision salamanca fire on the ships thrusters taking them down fast leaving it adrift.  As he pulled up past it he dropped a screamer to finish it off.  It exploded in a bright flash of light behind him.  
<br />
<br />On the bridge of the <i>Prometheus </i> Fernando Gonzalez never had felt so alive as he did now, when he retired from the fighter corps a decade ago he thought his days had been relegated to station commander at best and unable to feel the adrenaline rush of an offensive.  &#8220;Sir we have two incoming torpedos bearing down on starboard, they've made it through our countermeasure screen, we stopped the other eight though.&#8221; the weapons officer said.  &#8220;Were will it hit and where do we turn to make i not do as much.&#8221; Fernando replied.  &#8220;As it stands it will hit the torpedo tubes, turn 45 degrees starboard.&#8221;  he said.  Fernando knew what that would mean, even though the stockpile theoritically shouldn't detonate as a result, safeguards could always fail and he wasn't about to take that chance.  &#8220;Helmsman sharp 45 degree starboard.&#8221; the capit&#225;n yelled.
<br />
<br />The ships thrusters now proved a very wise investment in place of an extra main gun or two.  The vessel moved to the side avoiding a potentially highly disasterous situation.  Then the torpedos hit, the side of the vessel, both were sunslayers an extreme rarity for the zoners or bounty hunters causing massive hull damage.  The nanobot storage spots throughout that side of the ship immediately deployed to get the hull back up to usuable status.  Fernando got up from the ground on the bridge rubbing his head, which he had hit on the back of his chair during the intense impact.
<br />
<br />Horatio watched as the torpedos hit the <i>Prometheus </i> it seemed to have held up pretty well against its first heavy fire direct hit.   He barrel rolled his fighter downward lining himself up with a Hammerhead and fired off 6 missiles firing each with careful precision, all but one made their marks as Horatio used his after burner to get extremely close.  Within minutes the Hammerhead was in many pieces.  His comm came in clean, they had won.  The bounty hunters and zoners had been destroyed.  Horatio then looked at his forces loss chart, Ensign Marcus Vincent was that loss, a good man and a good friend.  He got a commlink come into his ear.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Capit&#225;n Gonzalez, all fighters return and arm yourself for boarding action.  The Prometheus is going to board Freeport 9.&#8221; the voice said.
<br />He began to turn his craft around but before he could say anything a transmission came in from the station, &#8220;We no longer wish bloodshed, corsairs, the zoners of freeport 9 surrender to you.&#8221; said the commander of the station.  Fernando responded.  &#8220;Very well I am docking my battleship with your hangar, you will be processed there for shipment to prison colonies on Crete were you will mine for us till we say.&#8221;  A response came from a man clearly in tears.  &#8220;Understood.&#8221; he said.
<br />
<br />Fernando sat back in the captain's lounge, they had begun processing an hour ago after scanning to ensure no booby traps when they docked.  He had sent to messages to Crete, asking for a replacement pilot and for several prison transports.  He had received a request, in a day they would arrive along with the reinforcements to secure the base and several crews to repair it and make it a fully operational Corsair outpost.  He had received a name for the station as well, Portugal.  Portugal Fernando thought, he knew some of his Earth ancestors had been from there, he like the name.  It was a name that would be the staging point for the invasion of the Outcasts and the uniting of Hispania.</div>

			<div class="content">Part II.  The Battle of Omicron Beta: The Iron Heart Is Born
<br />Episode A: Into the Unknown Void
<br />
<br />The old man continued reminiscing after ordering another scotch on the rocks at the bar, the young man listened intently.  The old man seemed to be getting deeper into the story, you could here it in his voice as he looked in the general direction of the jumphole to Omicron Beta.  His eyes began to water a bit.
<br />
<br />I had been unable to get a new pair of boots, thats what I remember about that day, the day that the reinforcements arrived here at Portugal Base.  I remember all the hallways were under construction from the battle to take the base.  It had been 2 weeks since they had won the battle to take the base formerly known as Freeport 9.  I had been on the bridge serving as navigation officer, because the standing one had been injured in the torpedo impact, this was my last day of duty before heading back to the ships navigation room.  
<br />
<br />I could not describe the sense of pride and sureness we had that day, coming into view, columns of warships arrived.  Trains and armored transports were heading towards the base escorted by legionairres, centurions, and Titans.  But these were not the only ships that arrived on the horizon, far from the sleek modern corsair vessels, another ship seemed to be coming, a long cigar shaped vessel, it appeared to be an aged Bretonian Warship, but it was not a house vessel, it belonged to the Independent Miners Guild which generally went by its acronym the IMG, its name <i>Hood </i>.  It carried 3 hawk wings, 2 falcon wings, and an eagle wings. 
<br />
<br />The ship docked with Portugal base slowly at a snail pace, by the face of Fernando I could tell he was quite unpleased, the man was a fan of speed, the warship would slow them down in Omicron Beta in a conventional, he preferred to just push through the system at cruise speed before reinforcements could arrive, the capit&#225;n would not be spoiled by these people.  &#8220;Communications officer, open a channel to Crete, ask them what an IMG battleship is doing in my attack group?&#8221; he yelled.  &#8220;Aye sir, forwarding message.&#8221; the comm officer sent the message.  5 minutes later a communication came back. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Enrique Hernandez, deputy foreign minister to the Elder. The IMG have offered us an alliance in exchange for assurances Tau 37 to be unharmed, we need this alliance if we are to protect our flank while your forces are on the offensive.  They want the <i>Hood </i> with you to prevent you from breaking that agreement.&#8221; the foreign ministers message came through.
<br />
<br />Fernando sent back another transmission.  &#8220;Minister Hernandez, that ship is far to slow and easy prey for fighters, I will hold you personably responsible for the bloodbath that will ensue.  Mark my words, many more corsairs will die this day, and when they do, Crete will feel its sorrow.&#8221; he closed the signal then.  &#8220;Communications officer, I want no more messages, prepare the fleet to move into Omicron Beta.&#8221; he said next no unemotionally at all.  But everyone on the bridge had now had their stomach twisted several times over.  Those words will echo in my heart together <i>the bloodbath that will ensue... </i></div>

			<div class="content">The old man finished his drink and ordered another, he needed a bit of alcohol to seothe his nerves to finish this part of the tale.  Two thirtish grizzeled hispanian fighter vets, real badasses gently but firmly gripped his shoulders to reassure him.  They to knew what it meant to lose comrades in battle.  
<br />
<br />The next morning the fleet was about 15 minutes from moving out, the Prometheus and eight trains refitted as light escort carriers equipped with it 4 on each side of the prometheus in a V formation.  Each escort carriers carried 2 wings of Titan very heavy fighter wings making up 60% of the entire Corsair Very Heavy Force.  Behind it were the smaller IMG force, the Battleship Hood and its fighter capacity, as well as 3 armored transports refit with torpedo launchers, the IMG called them PT boats, Fernando called them coffins.
<br />
<br />Horatio Gonzalez walked up to the new titan which had arrived.  He would have to get used to not seeing his old friend Manuel Rodriquez fighter there, this new one was a disturbing blemish on the hangar of familiarity.  He felt a hand put on his shoulder, he turned around.  A woman was standing there, &#8220;I need to get to my ship move.&#8221; she said.  &#8220;Excuse me, I'm senior squadron commander for all craft onboard the Prometheus.&#8221; he said outright indignant.  &#8220;Then move sir so I can be off this craft.&#8221; she replied annoyed.  &#8220;After this battle is over you can consider yourself underreview for punishment.&#8221; he gave as a final retort before he headed back to his fighter.  He felt the ship begin to accelerate slowly.  He wondered for a second why they hadn't engaged the cruise drive then he remembered the <i>Hood </i>.
<br />
<br />It had been a four day transit through Omicron Theta, when they had hit their first outcast patrols.  Horatio's wing was able to take down and they were fairly sure it was still a surprise attack, but Fernando wanted to delay the attack, he wanted things perfect, these requests of course were denied by Crete and he was told to press onward.  On the sixth day they had at last made it to the jumphole, there they found a outcast fleet of considerable size blocking their way.  &#8220;All ships full stop outside of weapons range.&#8221;  Fernando ordered.   
<br />
<br />&#8220;Report on how many enemy ships were are looking at.&#8221; he ordered.  &#8220;We are detecting 20 Saber Wings, 28 Stiletto Wings, and 40 Dagger Wings.  Wait, 4 more dagger wings and a stiletto wing just arrived through the jumphole.&#8221;  the radar officer said.  &#8220;By the time reinforcements would arrive we'd be overrun.  All fighters launch and attack, order the <i>Hood </i> to move in as a screen to protect the carriers,  advance the <i>Prometheus  </i> at cruise speed to engage the fighters as well.  Configure main cannons for anti-fighter, get me some missile locks as well.  Engage!&#8221; he said.  &#8220;With pleasure!&#8221; the helmsman and weapons officer said both at the same time.
<br />
<br />The <i>Prometheus </i> did a turn upwards as it prepared to activate its cruise engines as fighters poured from its deck and the decks of the smaller carriers as well as the <i>Hood. </i>  Long white feul streams moved through space in majestic formations being lead by the corsair battleship, it was a grand sight as a navy always is at full strength in formation before guns open and remind those foolish enough not to see the grizzly nature of war.</div>

			<div class="content">The corsair and IMG ships met outcasts ships with a bang as they met eachother missiles and multi-coloured energy bolts streamed off between eachother.  Fighters on both sides exploded, daggers and IMG fighters seemed to be torn to pieces rapidly with the exception of the eagles while the heavier units fought faster.  The <i>Prometheus's </i> main cannons fired on 4.00 fire setting rotating its firing arrays to prevent any major power drain or overheating.  The guns litup the spacelanes chasing after two stilettos lining them up and firing a trio of missiles at each destroying them.
<br />
<br />Horatio watched as two more titans blipped off the radar, they were dead.  His vessel suddenly began to rock he had a saber on his back, he entered into evasive manuvers as he slowly began cycling shield batteries.  His vessel continued to rock, he was coming to the realization he couldn't shake it.  Suddenly the rocking stopped and he looked as the very same saber was being pursued right past him by a Titan which he couldn't shake.  He flew great evasive but it exploded as it got hit almost nonstop consecutively.  A transmission came in from the victorous Titan, &#8220;Does this mean I can get off without punishment <i>SIR </i>&#8221; a voice came in with arrogance.  &#8220;Don't bet on it.&#8221; Horatio responded.  The Titan then fired a shot that barely missed his engine hitting a fleeing dagger.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell is wrong with you, are you some crazy pscho ***** lady?&#8221; Horatio yelled.  &#8220;I got a dagger didn't I?&#8221; replied the women.  Horatio growned as he pulled up on the pilot stick to engage a stiletto, he cycled through his weapons firing at its engine taking it down and then landing several salamanca II bolts into the cockpit finishing the job.  He then pulled up his ship.  Suddenly the outcasts vessels began to turn around and go through the jumphole.  Horatio looked at his casualty monitor, 6 titan pilots lost, 1 in need of repairs in his 4 wing squadron, out of the total force 7 wings were lost.  All the IMG was lost save 1 eage.  It was unclear how much of the outcasts were lost but it had been bloody.  At least half the fleet was killed leaving Beta largely ripe for the taking to a larger force, though it was their hometurf, Horatio had no doubt which his boss would choose.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Send a transmission to the main fleet tell them we need complete resupplies and many more fighters, also tell them greetings from Ruiz Base.&#8221; the comm officer looked up surprised.  &#8220;Transmission sent.&#8221; he replied promptly.  &#8220;Send a message to the rest of the fleet, attack with everything we have into the unknown void!&#8221;</div>

			<div class="content">The Prometheus screamed through the jump hole at immense speed.  Fernando Cortez wanted to hit the enemy with a surprise and he did.  Exiting at 40 k, the slow fired torpedoes of the outcasts were completely misfired the Prometheus long clearing them before they appeared on sensor, but the battleships precision guns were not so.  The salamanca mk II arrays unleashed deadly streams into two sabers destroying them as several daggers fell to the hell slayers.
<br />
<br />Titans came through the jump hole next downing the stray torpedoes and then joining the fight and then driving the enemy forces away from the jump hole securing it as the carriers and the Hood came through last.  Within minutes the battle had become a decisive Corsair victory.  The Prometheus began using its long range sensors to scan for a base in this region of space. 
<br />
<br />The azure debris field of the system hid the base well and it was undoubtedly not to close to the jump hole.  Fernando therefore came to the conclusion of splitting his forces in to.  He needed to score a decisive victory against the outcasts and engage them in open war if he was to have forces to take the base once he found it.  Ordering the carriers back to Portugal base he deployed several wings of Titans, the sole Eagle Wing, and the Hood to do a straight northward shot through the debris field while he and the Prometheus patrolled the perimeters of the debris field gathering information at cruise speed.
<br />
<br />The Hood&#8217;s captain, Geoffrey Plainsworth, approved of the plan more than he probably should have.  He took great pride in the Hood as a vessel and believed it to be the fleets greatest asset as it possessed heavy guns capable of destroying bases more effectively than the Prometheus which did not posses such technology.  Assuming command he ordered the fleet on a full northward course.  The wings of very heavy fighters lined up proceeding at slow speed through the debris field as the Hood blasted a path for itself.  Corsair pilots were undoubtedly very upset about this, they knew the enemy was bound to find them with all the energy discharges they were letting off as well as the added visual signals.
<br />
<br />About thirty minutes into the Hood&#8217;s patrol a large force appeared on radar, the full Outcast fleet for Omicron Beta along with reinforcements from Omicron Alpha had appeared.  Its pilots were fully refreshed and armed whereas the fleet of the Corsairs and Independant Miners Guild had been deployed for hours now and had already gone through an intense battle and a mid-sized one.  Never the less Plainsworth ordered the fleet to begin engaging, even as half the standing force was missing and the Hood began firing wildly into their fleet.  &#8220;Crush the savage vermin!&#8221; he yelled from the Hood in a thick Bretonian accent.
<br />
<br />Horatio sighed as he moved his fighter nose towards the incoming fleet.  He immediately hit the afterburners as he fired off a pair of hellslayers at an enemy dagger hitting its cockpit and destroying the craft.  He then broke off engaging a stiletto firing off his salmancas as at it as he followed it slowly burning a hole in its shield then hitting its engine taking it out of commission.  As it stopped it released a plethora of mines which immediatley caused Horatio to pull up.  His craft began to shake as shields went down and severe damage to the lower fin on the craft occurred.  Horatio cycled a few nano-bots to repair it, not wanting to uselessly expend shield batteries he used his after burner to cycle to the rear of the battle and then back to the front as his shields recharged.  As he did this he saw the majority of the Sabers the enemy had in their possession move in for torpedo runs on the Hood.  The ship immediately began full retreat as its guns tried to down incoming torpedoes.  Eventually however the ship became overwhelmed then the hull began to give way.  Finally the vessel broke into two pieces and then four as its power distribution grid went critical tearing it apart.
<br />
<br />It was at this time that Fernando Cortez arrived.  He had gotten his goal, the separation of the very heavy units from the mess of craft the Outcasts had deployed.  His forces dropped out of cruise speed between them and the main group of craft, about a quarter of his fighters split off from the main group assisting Horatio&#8217;s fighter groups and holding them.  The rest of his forces and the battleship Prometheus unleashed hell upon the sabers surrounding them and tearing them to pieces with heavy weaponry.  The vessels then turned around and began to engage the main group which began to form a retreat.  It would be very unlikely that they could make one at this point. 
<br />
<br />The Corsairs advanced through Omicron Beta.  Prometheus soon came upon the location of the Outcast base there.  But there was no much of a battle involved.  The base had been all but abandoned, a few residents remained, mostly traders.  The fight for Omicron Beta had been over.  Horatio though was very perturbed.  The Capit&#224;n had begun to acquire a name among the fighter pilots, Coraz&#242;n Del Hierro, the Iron Heart.</div>

			<div class="content">Part 3: The Fires of Malta
<br />
<br />The man at the bar speaking then moved to the part of the legend that was the most taboo. &#8220;Had we known at that time, the IMG were in no condition to mount an attack against us, perhaps Coraz&#243;n Del Hierro would have refrained and been able to carry out a long siege, but at that time the generals firmly believed war with the powerful Guild and possibly the BHG would have come soon, as such Fernando burned Malta to the ground preventing the reconciliation between the brothers of Hispania for years.&#8221;   
<br />
<br />Reinforcements had arrived at Ruiz Base.  Apparently war had broken out between Rheinland and Kusari so the Hessians had decided to take advantage of it, therebye freeing up the entire western front fleet in Omega 5 for the offensive into Omicron Alpha. Scouts had found the location of Malta and now the greatest Corsair fleet ever assembled was preparing to finish off the Outcasts while they were still recovering and licking their wounds.  1 additional Prometheus Class vessel had arrived, this one named the Deucalion.  Supposedly four vessels should have been ready for the offensive, but the houses war had lead to added protection of convoys and pirating resources to build them would be unavailable.  In addition to the 2 battle cruisers, 18 train carrier-refits were equipped and ready to go.  Total fighter forces were 36 Titans, 40 Centurions, and 100 Legonairres.  An impressive force and one that would undoubtedly put fear into the Outcats.
<br />
<br />Fernando sat at the table of generals who were preparing the attack.  &#8220;We must strike now, the IMG holds us responsible for the tragic destruction of the Hood, I say they have good reason and we should not be surprised if war is declared on us, we will have to destroy the Malta's bases quickly if we are to return to the Omegas in time to defeat the IMG in Omega 7 and 3.&#8221; one of the generals said.  Fernando rose from the table yawning briefly.  &#8220;Are you insinuating I am responsible for the destruction of that poorly trained IMG force that was sent with us here.  They signed their death warrant as soon as they attempted to use House Tactics in this region of space.&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;Nevertheless you have used them as bait, it is creating problems, and the IMG is buying up all the surplus military hardware and civilian hardware it can from the houses who need the money to finance their arms races!&#8221; the general replied.
<br />
<br />Fernando sat back and lit a cigar.  &#8220;So you fear corporate dogs, I see, to take Malta without a protracted siege, I will need to destroy much of it with orbital bombardment, in short I will be forced to get a surrender through fear alone.&#8221; he said as he blew a ring of smoke.  The generals sat back.  &#8220;We need the resources of the Outcasts in our possesion to defeat the Houses.&#8221; the Supreme General said.   &#8220;My friends, I am not going to bombard their production facilities, I intend to destroy their civilian centers.&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;I have refit several suncrusher torpedos with atmospheric re-entry capability.&#8221;  Fernando finally finished.
<br />
<br />The generals were all taken back.  &#8220;Unleashing a pair of those warheads on a major city would cause significant casualties.  It is tantamount to genocide.&#8221; one stood up and objected.  &#8220;In relationships between nations, there is one truth, only one, whoever can project all their power best wins, this is the fundemental truth.  The enemy is demoralized, that gives us a major advantage, but now it is time to crush the outcasts hopes.  Victors commit no genocides only losers, we will win, and thus we commit no genocide.&#8221; Fernando replied taking another puff on his cigar calmly.  Despite the horror, no one could argue with those truths, the Second World War on Earth had shown this, none of the victors ever stood trial for warcrimes even though both sides had committed them.
<br />
<br />After some debate, the method of attack was cleared by the council of generals and the Elder gave quick authorization from Crete.  The plan of attack was clear, they were going to turn Malta's major cities into pools of radioactive fire until the Outcasts surrendered fully, no mercy would come to them.  
<br />
<br />The long feul streams from the Prometheus and the Deucalion went out as they cruised through space.  Behind them the columns of escort carriers moved holding the fighters for the assualt uponst the planet Malta.  Their was an air of dread about the mission throughout the crew as they passed into the jumphole between Omicron Beta and Omicron Alpha, many prayed for the redemption of their souls knowing these were the last moments they had before doing the unthinkable.  Destroying a world.</div>

			<div class="content">The Prometheus slowly appeared on deep space telemetry followed by the rest of the fleet on Malta's satellite network.  The fleet as it closed to fifteen space clicks began to deploy its fighter squadrons, this caused the telemetry system to light up with various many smaller dots.  Rear Admiral Ricardo commander of the telemetry early warning system began to process dispatches to Fleet Admiral Diaz who was in charge of the Malta Systems defenses.
<br />
<br />Diaz sat in his chair aboard the newly commissioned fortress base <i>Iberia </i> it had been armed with ten battleship grade cannons, construction had started two years before, the commissioning of an anti-capital grade platform was controverial when the government financed it, they had never expected the Corsair's to have battleships and had always anticipated using it to defeat a house force. &#8220;Charge all cannons to full power, launch the defensive squadrons.  Activate orbital thrusters to take us out of geo-synchronus orbit and into the combat zone.&#8221; Diaz said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes sir, deep space telemetry reports enemy fleet at 10 space clicks.&#8221; replied the chief operations officer.  The station suddenly jolted as a large reactor engine rocked the ship into a faster eliptical orbit within five minutes bringing it in front of the incoming fleet, another thruster fired stopping the station with equal gee shock.  The stations cannons began to turn as they aimed towards the Prometheus and the Deucalion.  In front of  the Iberia assembled 20 Saber VHFs, 30 Stilettos, and 70 Daggers.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Admiral Diaz, were detecting the enemy has over 170 fighters at their command.&#8221; said the radar officer.  &#8220;Damn they must have been able to pull resources off the western front with Rheinland at war.&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Don't dispair victory to us, fire the cannons, destroy their battleships.&#8221; he ordered.  The Iberia's cannons openned in a fierce salvo large bolts streamed towards the two battleships.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Evasive to starboard.&#8221; ordered Fernando on the bridge of the Prometheus.  The Prometheus's crew braced themselves as the ship exectuted a hard turn.  A cannon bolts braised the side port side taking off part of a ships fin and rocking the ship hard.  &#8220;Target the stations guns with hellslayers and fire a barrage every in 4 second intervals, arms starkillers in 2 second intervals, and use salmanca arrays to repel fighter attacks.  Issue similar orders to the Deucalion, whats her status anyways.&#8221; Fernando ordered.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Deucalion reports the loss of her starboard salmanca array.&#8221; replied the comm officer.  Fernando nodded.  &#8220;Accelerate to attack speed, they'll have a hard time hitting us with those guns then.&#8221; he said.  The two vessels increased their speed as they fired.  Meanwhile the Corsair fighters entered into combat with their outcasts counterparts.  Both sides fired off waves of missiles and energy salvos into eachother.  Horatio sent out a transmission.  &#8220;The Deucalion seems to have taken a hit and is being harassed by the enemy.  Titan wings 1-2 follow me in to defend her.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The eight Titans pulled up into enemy fighters harassing the Deucalion with torpedos that it struggled to down.  Horatio locked onto a stiletto firing in a cycle hellslayers and salamancas into the ship downing it.  He then broke off and engaged a Saber following it.  
<br />
<br />Meanwhile a trio wing of legionairres broke through the main fighter screen of Outcasts fighters and made an attack run on the Iberia which by now had been reduced down to eight guns.  The dozen craft poured forth from their salmancas energy bolts in a constant stream on one of the stations guns as anti-fighter turrets openned up on them.  The energy bolts hit punching through the armor in approximately 45 seconds causing a massive explosion.  As they pulled up from the run to make another pass the anti-fighter guns downed four of the craft.  Then they were engaged by a pair of Sabers which gave them one hell of a fight, they managed to down one before they were taken out. 
<br />
<br />The Prometheus shook as another bolt hit its nose causing a hull breach.  The enemy platform had now however been taken down to 3 turrets.  Horatio's Titan zipped passed the capital ship escorted by two wingmen.  &#8220;Lets take this thing down, fire torpedos.&#8221; he said.  The 3 craft each fired off a duo of deadly sunslayers destroying the stations anti capital ship defenses then pulled up hitting their after burners and cycling a few shield batteries to keep from anti-fighter fire.  &#8220;Capit&#224;n, your battleships are clear for assualt.&#8221; Horatio said.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;Much appreciated Commander Horatio.&#8221; replied Fernando.  &#8220;Deucalion and Prometheus, bring your weapons full to bear on this station.&#8221; He said.  The two battleships openned up on the Iberia quickly causing hull breaches throughout the station as Corsair fighters swarmed around them defending them from the Outcasts fighter squadrons.  
<br />
<br />Fleet Admiral Diaz sent a message.  &#8220;All forces retreat to Cali Base, you shall stay their to fight another day.  Malta's ground forces must defend her now!&#8221;  He said, these were his last words as a pair of hellslayers breached the main reactor of the station causing it to explode.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Fernando Gonzalez of the Corsairs, Malta is to surrender and accept a position of fealty to the government of Crete, acknowledging it as the leader of House Hispania, all military forces are to be handed over to my fleet, these are the terms of your surrender.&#8221; Fernando said as he broadcasted a message down to the Don of the Outcasts on Planet Malta.
<br />
<br />&#8220;If you want Malta come and take it by force.&#8221; was the reply he received.  That left him no choice.  &#8220;Target a pair of modded sunslayers on Malta's second largest metropolitan area.  FIRE!&#8221; he said.  He watched as the two warheads left the torpedo tubes of the ship and moved away from it towards the planet.  They entered the atmosphere then vanished from view, about a minute later a bright flash over the area, who's lights could be viewed from this position in space lit up, then their was darkness.  &#8220;Send my message again.  Tactical officer, get another pair of torpedos ready target the third largest, tell the Deucalion to do the same and target the capital.&#8221; instructed Fernando.
<br />
<br />The response came again from the Don's government.  &#8220;We will never surrender!&#8221; it said.  &#8220;Fire the Prometheus's torpedos, send the same transmission while they are firing them off, instruct him a second pair of torpedos will be launched 1 minute after we have confirmed that the government has received the message and that the capital will be destroyed.   &#8220;Yes sir.&#8221; the comm officer replied again, this time significantly more relunctantly.
<br />
<br />Another boom occurred.  &#8220;Sir, we have received a message that they have surrendered but it took them 1 minute and 20 seconds, the Deucalions torpedos are on their way.&#8221; replied the comm officer.  &#8220;I am aware of that, those were the terms.&#8221; replied Fernando.  He lit a cigar.  &#8220;Send a message to the Elder, Malta is his.  Tell the carriers to stay and deploy the marines to occupy.  All fighters and the two battleships full cruise speed to Omicron Beta and continue on optimum course for Omega 7.&#8221; he said and took another puff on his cigar.  As he did that a large flash on the planet below occurred, in that flash would be a firey death for the capital city of the Outcasts and its estimated 760,000 inhabitants.</div>

			<div class="content">Enjoying this. Truly a fine read <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Good descriptions, though I felt the last two paragraphs could have been filled out emotively a little more. Something like..
<br />
<br />&quot;The screams of those about to be consumed by the fast approaching fireball could be heard over the communications channels.&quot;
<br />
<br />Something to help the reader understand or visualise what those terrible weapons are doing..?
<br />
<br />There's no rush, please keep writing. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
