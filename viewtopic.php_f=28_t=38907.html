			<div class="content"><b>Attention!  A new version of the mod is available now    </b>
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=1781' Target=_Blank>Click here to download this new version.</a>
<br />
<br />Version 1.2  is a very large point release.  New features include ShipDealers with brand-new THN scripts and Mbases entries and many other details, including capships that are buyable, flyable and met in Encounters.  In short, this is a very big release, and modders should take a long look at all of the things that have been added.  I will be the first to say that the documentation needs to be upgraded... but I've been a little busy lately, if you've been by the 3D Modeling Forum you'd know what I'm talking about <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />What is this mod all about?  Well, here are the basics:
<br />
<br />**************************************************************************************************
<br />
<br />The XML Toolkit Mod is a fully-functional rebuild of FL for SP, OpenSP and MP, made for gamers who love FL, modders who want to improve it, and server operators who don't know a lot about modding and want to make some minor changes to FL's game-balance, but keep the same &quot;feel&quot;.  This mod has been made to specifically address a lot of the game-design problems with MP, but is also a very interesting experience to play in the SP storyline.
<br /> 
<br />**************************************************************************************************
<br />
<br />Modders and server ops should feel welcome taking this and making the mod of their dreams.  This mod includes a lot of in-depth documentation to help you get started and guide your steps.  It is one of the most modder-friendly designs ever made for this game engine, and makes a lot of things that were a real chore to do, like adding new Ships to the game... much, much easier.
<br /> 
<br />But this is not just some technical widget.  I have put a lot of subtle touches and improvements into the mod, such as:
<br /> 
<br />6 new flyable ships, including the &quot;lost&quot; FL ships- the Starblazer, the CSV, the Blood Dragon HF and the Liberty Torch.
<br /> 
<br />Every FL ship has been re-balanced.  None of the original ships has been left unchanged, and they've all been balanced with an eye towards fairness- armor and cargo both effect the mass and turning speed of ships- and heavier ones get more Power for their weapon systems.  Freighter pilots will enjoy this mod considerably <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /> 
<br />Every weapon and Shield has been re-balanced.  There aren't any more weapons that don't track right, for example, and each weapon's advantages and disadvantages have been very carefully re-balanced.
<br /> 
<br />The AI has been improved, especially at the high end.  It's quite a bit &quot;smarter&quot; now.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Missiles now feature visible projectiles and reworked sounds- you can actually hear missiles being fired at you.
<br /> 
<br />Sounds of all sorts have been edited or replaced.  High-pitched Cruise engines have been toned down, for a less irritating audio experience on those long Missions.
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Players should give FL's storyline another try, and enjoy the differences, some of which are subtle, and others are profound- everything from the way the weapons work to the way that ships fly has been touched in various ways.  Assuming that you do not abuse Wrecks, you will find the SP campaign to be considerably more challenging than the original, but perfectly fair.
<br /> 
<br />********************************************************
<br /> 
<br />This mod has many, many features, added via XML scripts, CMP modifications and INI coding.  I have rebuilt substantial parts of the FL SDK in an effort to really improve how we mod things.  Every major area that's been modified has been well documented, so that people can see what's been done and why.  This mod is intended to help newbie modders, or experienced modders who don't yet use XML... to learn how to do so.  You do not need to install the FL SDK to use this mod, but it'd be helpful, especially if you're wanting to learn more about how to mod FL- this is an extension to the SDK, not a replacement.
<br /> 
<br />********************************************************
<br /> 
<br />Rebuilt AI.  In a first for a FL mod, I have completely deconstructed FL's AI schema and have rebuilt it from the ground up.  Every ship in the game uses new AIs, from ships in the Storyline to Random Encounters.  Modders can use my &quot;template&quot; AIs as a model for building their own.
<br /> 
<br />Rebuilt Weapons, with much better balance.  All weapons shoot accurately, and the advantages/disadvantages of each Weapon Type have been revamped.  Trust me, you will immediately notice the differences.  Missile behavior has been radically altered, making Cannonballs and other heavy missiles much less unbalanced for MP.  Moreover, weapon levels have been taken out, giving MP a much greater range of options- VHFs no longer have a monopoly on Class 10 weapons.
<br /> 
<br />Rebuilt Physics.  This includes both major and minor changes to the way that all of the ships in the mod fly.
<br /> 
<br />Rebuilt Ship Balance.  Every buyable/flyable ship has been totally re-balanced from the ground up.  There is now a point to buying a Defender, for example- it's actually a pretty nice ship, when it's properly balanced <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /> 
<br />Rebuilt Thrusters.  This includes XML extensions that allow people to revamp Thrusters very easily, among other things.
<br /> 
<br />Rebuilt Shields.  All ships use the same shields.  This has been done before in many mods, but the way it's been implemented in this mod is different- all AI-specific Shields have been totally removed.
<br /> 
<br />Power Upgrades via XML.  In a &quot;first&quot;, I have built XML scripts that can add Power Upgrades (or other equippable upgrades) to any ship which has the appropriate Hardpoint installed.  Take the XML script out... and no more Power Upgrades.  Simple but elegant <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /> 
<br />**************************************************************************************************
<br /> That's just a summary... basically, if you're new to modding, or have been modding for awhile now but are interested in improving your craft... check this out.  I have distilled everything I've learned in the last 7 months into this package, and documented my work so that you don't have to pick things apart just to understand what I've done or why <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Good luck, and have fun!

			<h3><a href="#p367025" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content"><i>Answer to the following question, posted elsewhere: &quot;Did you alter the faction-rep balance ? Seems to be harder to get friendly with Junkers - or am I wrong ? </i>
<br />
<br />No... I haven't changed the Faction reputations or the way that reputations change.  I know how, of course- I built Warriors of the Sky, which has custom Factions and stuff.  But this is meant to be a codebase as well as a fun mod, so I've left that stuff alone, so that modders can work with something that's close to &quot;stocK&quot; FL.
<br />
<br />In 1.1, the only CTD issue I have found (and killed in the next version) is in Bretonia.  I have been playing through the Storyline again to test.
<br />
<br />But be warned... in 1.1, taking a Tradelane to Southhampton Shipyard will frequently result in CTD.  I didn't put this error into the code- it's present in the SDK and presumably in FL's INIs, and I hadn't altered any of this previously.  It's an Encounter type that DA never really did complete correctly, having to do with freeing prisoners (one of the many cool ideas that never quite got done).
<br />
<br />This has been fixed in the current version, and I've removed all of the bad Encounter types from my codebase, adding quite a few new INI scripts to squash this bug everywhere.  It's funny- I never noticed before, but this bug must've been occuring quite often, but not causing a complete crash... because removing the bad lines from the Zones effected really made a big difference in how smoothly Encounters work there.  
<br />
<br />At any rate... v. 1.2 will have a huge list of improvements.  This time, I'm adding some new things to the game design that are a little more noticable:
<br />
<br />1.  Every Base will have a Ship Dealer, with custom Rooms (to keep it visually interesting).  This is going to support modders who want to add a bunch of new ships to FL... I've made making that easy one of my top priorities, and adding Ship Dealers gives modders a ton of room to expand.  The side effect of this is that quite a few Factions who previously had nowhere for players to buy custom ships specific to their Faction... are now open for business.  I'm kind've looking forward to making some pink and pastel ships for the GC <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />2.  Players will be able to buy/fly/fight Cruisers and Gunboats, including the Kusari and Bretonia stuff that you never got to see in the original game.  I have not put Dreadnoughts/Battleships in, and won't put them in until I've decided how I'm going to solve their docking issues, etc.  Tonight I got done with all of the military ships, and I've been having a lot've fun flying around Cruisers and Gunboats and generally blasting everybody in sight.  Cruisers and Gunboats that you meet in Encounters have Shields, and are generally pretty nasty.  The ones in the Storyline missions are pretty much as they've always been (which is to say... easy to kill, and lousy shots), aside from fixing the bug with their guns (multi-barreled guns didn't make any firing sound in the original game- now they do).
<br />
<br />Modders will hopefully appreciate that I've added all of these new things through XML, which means if they don't like it... it's easy to cut <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />3.  All of the other &quot;utility&quot; ships will also be buyable.  Everything from the Repair Ship to the Trains.  The buyable versions will be customized for good gameplay- I am aiming for Trains to have 2000 cargo, Large Transports 1500, Transports 750, and their guns will be little less harmless than the versions the AI use, so that players will be able to use these as practical cargo ships in MP.
<br />
<br />Once again, this is being done with XML.
<br />
<br />4.  I'll be adding at least 1 new custom ship... maybe more if I have time.  I already have a new ship for the Xenos implemented, so I'm mainly going to see what needs doing on the code end and go from there.
<br />
<br />Uh... I think that's about it, really... oh yeah, and Mines and Torpedoes are getting reworked and rebalanced.  You will not be able to carry as many of either, but they will generally be more effective.  Mines especially.</div>

			<div class="content">Question to other players of this mod : Am I a whimp ?? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />As I wrote earlier i really like the advanced AI in this mod - even low-level-missions can be a challenge in SP.
<br />Last weekend I played this mod on a LAN-server, two players (in the starting &quot;Starflier&quot;-ships) against the AI. But after several attempts with level 1-missions in the New York System we gave up. We had no chance to win even a level-1-mission <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ; we were frustrated because all credits were used for new nanobats/shield batteries. 
<br />Most of the time one of the players was killed in the middle of action with shields up to 40 - 60 % and hull up 100 %. Just &quot;BOOM&quot;.
<br />It seems that twice it could be direct collision-damage (once hit by NPC, once collision with debris). But we died several times without such obvious reason. And because the low-level-NPCs do not have special strong weapons I would like to as other MP-players of this mod: 
<br />anyone had similar problems ? Are the two of us just lousy pilots ? Is a party of two too weak for MP-fights against the AI ?

			<div class="content">Hmm... I've won Missions single-handidly in a stock Starflier in MP.  MP's quite a bit harder than SP, but you can manage your odds:
<br />
<br />1.  Get lvl 1-2 Assassination missions against the Rogues.  These are the easiest missions in the game.  Why?  Because you just have to kill two Rogues, and the boss shows up...
<br />
<br />2.  With your initial $2000, get a shieldbuster/Pulse weapon- the early civilian models are called <b>Stunpulses </b>.  You can buy them on Trenton or Pittsburgh.  They weren't as big of a deal in the original game, which is why most people aren't familiar with them, except for the high-end ones like the Tizona del Cids.  In the Toolkit Mod, they make a very large difference, because Shield strength is more important than previously.  Basically, Pulse weapons are the best way to knock down Shields fast.  They fire slower than Lasers, but even so... they knock down Shields far faster than anything else will, and cost less energy to fire than most things for the damage they do.  They're worthless for doing armor damage, but that's why you mix and match weapons.
<br />
<br />3.  If all else fails... trade until you can upgrade.  Nobody says you <i>have </i> to take Missions right off the bat.
<br />
<br />4.  Look very, very carefully at the level of the Missions you're taking.  It tells you the level right there in the Mission description.  Level 3-4 Missions are quite a bit harder than 1-2.  Trust me.
<br />
<br />5.  If your aim sucks, get Lasers or Photons and shieldbusters.  If you have decent aim, get Plasma and shieldbusters.  A Starflier with two Lavablades and a Stunpulse is a very decent fighter.  Either way... mix your weapons.  
<br />
<br />6.  Missiles only work at the high end.  Don't bother.
<br />
<br />7.  The low-level Thruster lasts a veeeeeery long time.  Use it.
<br />
<br />8.  Running into things is bad.
<br />
<br />9.  Use your strafe keys.  The AI doesn't hit you very well if you strafe.  Strafe back and forth even when you're charging bad guys.
<br />
<br />10.  During the initial engagement... keep your Cruise engines on until you're about 2000M away from the first checkpoint.  Then line up on the checkpoint and hit Engine Kill (default is X)... and drift at 370+ right through the first attack- the deadliest part of any Mission!  Then hit your Thrusters and engage the enemy.  You can win a lot of fights by simply not getting hit much in the first second or two.
<br />
<br />At any rate... I'm half-tempted to make a video of me playing, just to show people the basics.  I doubt if you and your friend suck that much, Zazie- sometimes you just need the right tactics.  Once you've learned them... it's really not that bad.  Really.</div>

			<div class="content">Thank you for this strategy guide. Most of it I knew already, glad about the hint with stunpulses, you are right, in unmodded games they are not that important, will try this.
<br />But: my point was not, how to win a dogfight. My question was:
<br />How is it possible that we got &quot;boomed&quot; several times in one single shot. AFAIK on level 1/2 NPCs do not use missiles (and we hadn't any &quot;incoming missile&quot;-warnings btw.) - and their mines (if there were any) were not the problem.
<br />To make a comparison: Take your reaction when you have a CTD in the middle of a fight. Crash - and you don't know why (in gameplay, not while testing <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ).
<br />Don't want to make a confusion: we did NOT have game-crashes, no CTDs - but our death in the middle of fighting without obvious reason (as described above) was strange.
<br />That's why I was asking if other players of this mod had the same 'problems' in MP. 
<br />Anyway - I'll try again. I want to know if i am SUCH A S**** PILOT <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">In Starfliers, you have very few hitpoints.  It may very well be that you're just dying from a salvo, if you're fighting Xenos or Outcasts- anybody who's using Particle or Neutron weapons is very dangerous to a Starflier with near-zero shields, because it only takes 3-5 hits do totally destroy you- the first one in the salvo will knock the shield down, and the rest of the salvo will then impact... resulting in insta-death.
<br />
<br />At any rate... try Lavablades and Stunpulses.  If you have decent aim, you can own just about anything low-level with them- just aim carefully, and don't shoot until you're definately going to hit something.  I've done playtesting in MP, SP and OpenSP for this mod, and am a huge believer in playtesting my creations, so I know it's possible to win against the AI.  If I have to make it easier at the low end, let me know that, but my objective is to make things harder without it being ridiculous.  None of the AI pilots, even at the high end, has perfect aim, for example- that's ridiculous, and isn't much fun (trust me, I've tried it).</div>

			<div class="content">Again: is it only me?
<br />I've tried again over WE and played MP (alone on my own LAN server so it was even a little bit more difficult). I succeeded with several level-1-jobs but had still my problems.
<br />Observations of my testing:
<br />1. Missions in Asteroid or Debris Fields are a real pain with your starting ship (you give the reason in your post above - the Starflier and its shield(s) - *sigh* ). Hitting once a rock/debris knocks your shield off and then you are an easy prey (if you survive the impact - what is unsure when you are on thruster speed).
<br />
<br />2. The &quot;BOOM&quot;-problems mentioned in my earlier posts happen most of the time in the same phase of the job: 
<br />Phase 1 you have to deal with a limited number of NPCs, one tries to escape.
<br />Phase 2: this is the trigger for more NPCs to spawn, they attack. But with improved AI they do not only shoot at you but they try to 'fly into you/hit you' (what's the english word for that ?). Result is immediate death, your ship/shield simply is not able to survive such an attack that mostly happens from the back. The weapons are - you're right - not the problem.
<br />So I tried to avoid the collisions but this is difficult when three of them run on you. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand it seems that collision damage only affects players. Twice I tested: I shot a Rogue down to about 10% of hull (or even less - and no shield) and then I tried to kill him by collision (shield and hull at full level). Result: Rogue - 1, zazie - 0 <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />For a rather experienced FL-player its hilarious to die all the time in level-1-jobs. Great fun - but a bit odd with time. It reminds me of Hostile Universe 8.0 which was unwinnable in the campaign so Giskard made some corrections for 8.1.
<br />
<br />Don't take me wrong: I do not ask to alter the seetings of AI-&quot;Hardness&quot; or difficulty. But players should have a decent chance to win level-1-jobs to get more credits for better equipment. 
<br />Possibilities:
<br />- Another starting ship
<br />- Better equipped starflier
<br />- more starting credits
<br />- higher paid level-1-jobs (player still has to make choice where he dares to fight, badlands and Detroit Debris field big No-No <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />- special &quot;Whimp&quot;-Jobs at - let's say - Trenton Outpost with reduced number of NPCs.
<br />
<br />Maybe - I have to test that - I should just trade with the Rhino. But honestly I did not dare to leave New York System for better trade as long as I hardly can't survive a meeting with the rogues in a LF
<br />
<br /> I don't care a beep beep about my rank</div>

			<div class="content">Collision behavior for the AI is different in MP than in SP.  
<br />
<br />In SP, you'll see the AI take collision damage.  It's just a quirk of the game engine- FL does a lot of things  differently in MP, including the way it interprets the AI.  If you've tried the mod with OpenSP Lite, you'll see what I mean- the MP ships are using the exact same AI script, but they are much harder to kill, because they're using all of the dodging behaviors, not just a few.  Balancing SP and MP on the AI side is a bit tricky.
<br />
<br />At any rate... I'll see if I can't make it easier at the low end, k?  I'm not a sadist, and I'd like your experience to be fun- I hate games that are too hard just as much as anybody <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Just because I can beat the AI in a Starflier doesn't mean everybody can.
<br />
<br />Soo... I'm thinking that maybe I'll put new MP players in a Starflier with 3 Justice 3s and a Level 2 Shield.  Does that sound like a decent boost, or too much?  That's double the shields and triple the damage... I figure that's probably good enough.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah... and I'm thinking that I'm going to use Gold as a reward for killing the AI, just like I did with WOS.  That was a feature that was a little more important in WOS, but it's still a workable concept.

			<div class="content">Thanks for considering my posts. 'Gold' as a reward is a great idea, I appreciate it.
<br />I have to test about starflier with 3 Justice 3 and level 2 shield. Could be that this is a little bit too much even for me ... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />I will try to edit the files with different settings - for the first time modding btw - so wish me luck <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I will post results of my testing (within 2-3 days)
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />Forgot to ask about weapons and cargo: Missiles do use cargo space (what is good imo), Torpedoes don't. Any specific reason ? I had a maximum of 15 slingshots on my Defender but could put another 80 torps (sunslayer? I forgot)

			<div class="content">Oh, the torps, CM and mines don't use Cargo space because I was being lazy, really, and wasn't sure how people would feel about the Missile re-balance.  
<br />
<br />I'm fixing that for the next version- basically, CM won't use much space and will cost very little (to encourage their use by newbies, because Missiles can cause serious pain) Mines will be much more powerful, but won't transmit Impulse, so they won't make you spin quite as much, but they'll hurt more, so that they're more practical weapons-of-last-resort for MP, and Torpedoes will probably get a much longer overall range and better tracking, but remain slow as dirt and turn poorly, so that they're more useful for Base-busting at the high end, and will eat a lot've cargo space.
<br />
<br />And I'm going to have a lot of new ships for people to play with- all of the FL ships (including the Cargo Lifter, which I have given a much-needed beauty upgrade, the Repair Ship, and the other oddities) and of course a few new creations to add some spice to the screenshots.  
<br />
<br />It's all coming along slowly, mainly because I've been adding Ship Dealers to every Base, which is fairly time-consuming and complicated programming, but ought to add a lot've options for modders who want to work with this codebase.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p368759" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">OK, here the results of my testing - of course everything in MP! :
<br />(But first, just for your fun: 
<br />Round 1: zazie reads Tutorials about how to change ship specs etc. =&gt; &quot;USE SDK, save your files&quot;
<br />Round 2: zazie makes changes on ship, starts gaming, wins everything without any problems
<br />Round 3: why the heck is it so easy ???
<br />Round 4: zazie checks what had happened when using SDK . lol)
<br />
<br />After such a glorious beginning of  -eehm- modding I started again. First I reinstalled your mod. I changed the weapons from Justice MK I to Justice MK II, upgraded shield to Adv. Sentry and a cargo of 10 (instead of 3) nanobots and shield batteries. 
<br />Conclusions after trying different other settings:
<br />- With two Justice MK II-cannons, Adv. Sentry Shield and 10 shieldbats/nanobots every player (even me <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) should have a fair chance to win level-1-jobs with starting loadout. After two or three jobs its possible to purchase a Defender or another better ship than Starflier. And of course &quot;Stunpulse&quot; makes survival easier
<br />- It is ONLY in the beginning that players could think it's too hard. But as soon as you get more credits after first jobs and are able to upgrade your equipment you always have a fair chance to win the jobs. 
<br />- Balancing: It's possible to reduce one of the three changes mentioned above without making the gamestart too hard: 
<br />Justice MK I /Adv. Sentry/more nanos/bats = OK 
<br />Justice MKII / Sentry/more nanos/bat         = OK
<br />Justice MKII / Adv. Sentry/ 3 nanos/bat      = OK
<br />
<br />Of course after all those change of settings I went back to your original setting. Still i think the potential of frustration is big. If a starting player is unlucky enough to be dodged twice in a row (I think that's the biggest danger, mor3e dangerous than being shot) on starting level-1-jobs then he might think there is no/little chance ever to upgrade from his starflier.
<br />But I have to admit: it is not impossible.
<br />
<br />Therefore: My suggestions
<br />1. Change the settings of the starting ships to 2 Justice MKII and Adv. Sentry shield. 
<br />Or:
<br />2. Offer Starting Ship options:
<br />- Hard (original setting)
<br />- Normal (as 1. above)
<br />- Easy (the one you mentionned earlier)
<br />
<br />It would be a pity if players stopped playing this wonderful mod after some frustrating experience in the first hour of playing.</div>

			<div class="content">Wow... thanks for doing that for me, Zazie.  I really appreciate this feedback about the balance- making that change is a snap, but it's great to get some good feedback about the levels required- it sounds like what I was proposing was &quot;too nice&quot; (and after doing some playtesting, I'd have to agree) <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />BTW, you want to edit the loadouts.ini that's in the mod's files, not the one in the SDK.  The mod has a custom loadouts file that's been adjusted in several places, so that things in the SP missions work right, for example.  So if you substituted a new Loadouts.ini, your results won't be the same.  The weapons and Shields carried by the Rogues, for example, are different in my mod than they are in stock FL (generally speaking, most ships have guns 1 level up, and in some cases, the Shields were also bumped, depending on what ship you meet where- for example, the Golden Chrysanthymums are flying Startrackers/Starfliers with Level 5 Shields, to keep them slightly challenging as you get better weapons and Power Generators).
<br />
<br />By the time you finish the SP campaign, most players (who don't go way out've their way to find Wrecks, etc.) will have Power Generator Mk. IIs and a nice ship (which, in this version of FL, is a pretty broad category- I beat the game driving a Dagger, but other players may want something heavier, such as a Freighter that's armed to the teeth).  So keep that in mind, too- the Power Generators change combat considerably and have a pretty big influence on game balance(which is why, from a coding standpoint, they are optional, and modders can remove them by deleting a file).  Once you have enough $$$ to buy one, you'll see what I mean- they're like a &quot;yes, now it's time to go to the more difficult hunting grounds&quot; upgrade in an RPG, but they're not overwhelmingly powerful <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Thanks for your answer - Argh, fantastic mod, close to the original gameplay, but some nice surprise (never forget the WOW when I first met a Treefrog - and alas for that Gaian, it had only a short but hopefully happy life <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ).
<br />I will try different settings of loadouts.ini. I played many hours and missions now in MP and SP (see below) with different tactics and i would like to increase SLIGHTLY the probability of getting weapons in a job. In early gameplay (Level 3 to about 6 I guess) sometimes the repair of my ship/equipment cost more than you get paid. Of course it's possible to go for the weapons in the wrecks but as a reward for winning against four or more Outcasts I would like to have a fair chance of getting their weapons. That's why i go for them <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> . 
<br />
<br />SinglePlayer Story Line - some observations:
<br />- The enhanced speed (400 than 300) may make the Race against Hovis very difficult for those FL-players who have difficulties with this race in Vanilla FL. It is now even more difficult to go through the gates. I needed several attempts. (Reynen btw had to put a downloadable save game for his TNG-mod only because of Hovis)
<br />- The Rheinlanders who try to stop you between Cambridge and Kusari Space are not really a challenge if you put the best shield against their weapons (I had a Defender first and then a Crusader, both with Power Generator MK II). I suggest they should be harder to defeat.
<br />- (Mild spoilers) When I got to Kyoto with my Crusader (could be also Defender, Wolfhound, Barracuda - all Heavy fighters) I was surprised to see that this base only offers LIGHT FIGHTERS. Treefrog a LF ? More annoying that I could not mount one of my set of four Adv. XY-shields. Now I have to decide if I want to attack Tekagi's Arch in a LF or continue with my rather vulnerable Crusader (I hate loosing my weapons <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content"><i>- The enhanced speed (400 than 300) may make the Race against Hovis very difficult for those FL-players who have difficulties with this race in Vanilla FL. It is now even more difficult to go through the gates. </i>
<br />
<br />Really?  I think that the improved performance of Strafe makes it easier, if anything.
<br />
<br />At any rate, making that part easier either means that I need to alter the layout of the track, or remove the physics improvements that so much fun elsewhere, which I'm pretty unlikely to do.
<br />
<br />Personally, I don't &quot;get&quot; people who have trouble with Hovis, but I do realise that there are a lot of folks out there who can't do it, so I'll look into what, if anything, should be done.  I have been seriously considering an &quot;easy version&quot; of this mod, with the AI nerfed a bit more and the physics stuff removed... that'd make the whole thing almost ridiculously easy, but that may be what some players want.  On the other end, I can make a &quot;hardcore&quot; version ... where Shields don't regenerate and the AI aims better... for those who think they're truly &quot;leet&quot;.
<br />
<br /><i>- The Rheinlanders who try to stop you between Cambridge and Kusari Space are not really a challenge if you put the best shield against their weapons </i>
<br />
<br />Is that Mission 8 or Mission 9 we're talking about?  I'll take a look and see how I can (gently) make it harder.  I didn't find that Mission to be super-huge challenge in the original game, either, so I wanted it to be hard, but not insane.  
<br />
<br />Trust me, as you get closer to the end... you <i>will </i> be challenged!  I made it hard enough that I had to actually try... which means that many players will find it too hard, but it ought to be a lot more satisfying to win.
<br />
<br /><i>- (Mild spoilers) When I got to Kyoto with my Crusader (could be also Defender, Wolfhound, Barracuda - all Heavy fighters) I was surprised to see that this base only offers LIGHT FIGHTERS.

<br />
<br />The Treefrog shouldn't be a Light Fighter- at least within Kusari space.  In Rheinland space, it would be a Light Fighter... I goofed.  Thanks for letting me know.
<br />
<br />The next version will be getting released sometime this week-ish, and will have lots of other flaws/bugs/minor irritations to look at, I'm sure, as well as all of the Very Cool Stuff that's in it <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>
