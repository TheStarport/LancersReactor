			<div class="content">Roger and Denson just argued how to make those guns working when Johnson enterd the bar.
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Darn.. so it seems that whatever we try it keeps blowing up.
<br />Johnson: what keeps blowing up?
<br />Denson: Ahh, you are back! Did you get those guns?
<br />O'Connor: And where did you get that suit?
<br />Johson: Its a good story let me tell you....
<br />
<br />*half and hour later*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Nice name for the corporation, but I'll never wear a suit so good.
<br />Denson: If I think about it, I don't remebe you wearing a suit at all?
<br />O'Connor: Yeah, its in my blood. Besides all those suits are itchy. Denson, could you now start working on those guns.
<br />Denson: Aye. *And Denson left to bay*
<br />Johnson: You came with me.
<br />
<br />*They both went to captains quaters*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: You know, everything is not like it seems.
<br />Johnson: What do you mean?
<br />O'Connor: I'm willing to bet that all you thought this is a cruiser.
<br />Johnson: It isn't?
<br />O'Connor: You have studied the blueprints, you should know. Anyway let's get back to the point. Those Raiders put a metal plate on me hand. *saying that he turned up his sleeves and shoved a fist sized plate on his hand*
<br />Johnson: And?
<br />O'Connor: I know that they did whatever they could, but I'd still want to gt rid of it. Or if thats impossible then something to do with it so it could be useful.
<br />Johnson: Hmmm...
<br />O'Connor: Removal would be better. I don't want to be trapped with a magnet...

			<h3><a href="#p194935" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">&quot;So let me get this straight.  Rhienland is using weapons designed by Liberty Skunk Works Div.  Didn't you geniuses design some counterbalance?  A super shield perhaps?&quot; Jezebel asked annoyed at the conclusion of Quigley's tale.
<br />
<br />&quot;I guess the R&amp;D guys didn't expect this to happen.  Or maybe they expected this to happen.  I don't know, and it doesn't matter anyways.  We need your help.  You've had combat experience against the Rhienlanders.&quot; Quigley implored.
<br />
<br />Jezebel got up from the cargo containers they had been using as chairs and walked away a couple of steps.  She surveyed the scene around her.  Quigley's pilots were huddled near their fighters.  Across the landing pad, the pirates were standing in front of their ships watching the LIberty pilots carefully.  The pirate leader crossed her arms and looked at the deck.  &quot;According to your story, you and your friends have all the Navy needs.  Why are you here?  What do you want from us?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;What we did against the <i>Arizona  </i> is nothing like what we need.  Liberty needs to know that tatics and equipment of the RNC regulars.  All we faced were traitors and expendable personnel.  Your Survivors have the knowledge we need.&quot;
<br />
<br />Jezebel turned and looked Quigley in the eye.  &quot;What's in it for us?  I'm not going to risk all that we have left for a incarceration after we're done.&quot;
<br />
<br />Quigley sighed, he'd hoped that the pirates would happily jump on board.  High Command hadn't given him anything to offer the Survivors.  &quot;I don't have any offers at the moment.  But if you help us out, I figure there's a pardon for all past crimes or atleast a three-day head start out of Liberty.&quot;
<br />
<br />Jezebel looked off at the Survivors, the men and women that depended on her.  &quot;You know, a monthes ago, I would have shot you for the fact you're a Pointer.  But seeing most the people I know reduced to dust by those damned Huns, just sets your world off.  The Survivors are at you service, Captain.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Call me Quigley.  Now...&quot;  Quigley was interrupted by a pirate running out onto the landing pad.
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain Jezebel, ma'am.  We've lost contact with the sensor station.&quot; the anxious pirate reported quickly.
<br />
<br />Jezebel's eyes got wide.  &quot;When was this?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A few minutes ago.  We got this last sensor reading before we last contact.&quot; the pirate handed her a datapad.  &quot;Oh my ga...&quot;  She looked at the pirate.  &quot;Relitt, get everyone into the ships.  Take only the equipment that can be loaded quickly.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What, who is it?&quot; Quigley asked, confused.
<br />
<br />&quot;Take a look.&quot; Jezebel threw him the datapad before running off into the chaos of the landing pad.  Quigley read the sensor reading.  They reported a group of unknown ships.  Twenty were fighter class.  One was cruiser class.  It also registered massive energy reading before the transmission dissolved into nothing.  <i>Rhienlanders! How did find us so quickly?  And when is my life going to stop acting like a frickkn' holodrama?  </i>
<br />
<br />He turned to his pilots, ready to bark out orders, when his eye landed on their fighters.  &quot;The Liberty Insignia!&quot;
<br />
<br />He ran over to his pilots.  &quot;We've got to get rid of the Liberty stars on our ships!&quot;
<br />
<br />Penn looked offended, &quot;We're Liberty Navy officers.  If we're caught without proper identification, we could be executed as spies.  Clear naval regs, <i>sir  </i>.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If the Rhienlanders see those stars, they'll know Liberty has been talking to the Survivors.  Since Rheinlanders are on the war path, Liberty consorting with their Pirate enemies would be a good justification.  Eh, Lieutenant?&quot;
<br />
<br />Shocked at the realization that had just been handed to him, Penn looked deeply worried.  As did the other pilots.  &quot;What do we do?  There's no time to paint over them.&quot; Penn blurted.  
<br />
<br />Penn question was answered by a blaster bolt into the side of Quigley's Valkyrie.  The pilots fell to the deck expecting the fire to track down after them and noticed that Wolfie wasn't among them.  They all looked around to find where Wolfie was and found his standing, his blaster leveled at <i>Valhalla Maiden  </i>.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wolfie, why the hell are you shooting my ship?&quot; Quigley yelled as he got up off the deck.
<br />
<br />&quot;Scratching paint, sir&quot; Wolfie answered with a shrug.  Quigley surveyed the damage to the <i>Maiden  </i> and found that the Liberty star had a black burn covering.  His mouth dropped.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wolfie, you're a genius.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's what my test scores say.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright, pilots.  You people have blasters.  Burn off the rest of the stars, and mount up.  There's squad or two of Rhienland advanced fighters and a cruiser heading this way.  It'll take the cruiser about twenty minutes to get into firing range. The fighters will be here in five.  Let's go.&quot;  While the Liberty pilots ran off with pistols drawn, Quigley climbed into his fighter and began the checklist to activate and power up his Avarice guns.  This was going to be an ugly battle, and the Survivors were going to need all the help they could get.

			<h3><a href="#p195312" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">*Johnson was right about to answer when Denson ran in*
<br />
<br />Denson: We got high redings all over the place. Everything just lid up!
<br />O'Connor: What are ya saying?
<br />Denson: Id this a reading failure or we have been surounded.
<br />O'Connor: Crap! We can't risk finding out. Johnson, would you go down and check those readings manualy?
<br />Johnson: Will do!
<br />O'Connor: Denson, lets activate the scondary shield and move speed to 8\10.
<br />Denson: Do we heat up?
<br />O'Connor: No need... yet. That would be big energy loss.
<br />
<br />*Comm started blinking*
<br />
<br />Johnson: I confirm! Power readings everywhere.
<br />Denson: Roger. *now from the bridge where every officer was* Increase speed to 8\10!
<br />O'Connor: All hands on battlestations. Primary goal: Get the hell out of here!
<br />Comm Officer: Drones have been destroyed, presuming targets to be hostile.
<br />Denson: Speed is 6\10 an rising.
<br />Comm Officer: We can't shake em' but they aren't closing in either.
<br />O'Connor: Probably just waiting for more assistance.
<br />Johnson: Captain! I have studied the ship blueprints and suggsest droping least two high proximity mines, so if they are following us we can rip some damages to their lines.
<br />O'Connor: I copy, on my mark.
<br />Denson: Speed 7\10 and rising.
<br />O'Connor: Heading 0351, destination New Florance Jump hole.
<br />Denson: Aye aye.
<br />Comm Officer: Theese things are still on range. Maybe they are something we pollute? A malfunction somewhere?
<br />O'Connor: Johnson! Check that out!
<br />Johnson: Already did sir. Nothing.
<br />O'Connor: Well there is only one way to find out...
<br />Denson: We have visual contacts on every side. We have to get through.
<br />Johnson: Prepearing to drop mines!
<br />Denson: Speed 8\10!
<br />O'Connor: Drop 'em!
<br />Johnson: Mines away.
<br />Comm Officer: Radio silence!
<br />
<br />*silence, then a huge explosion.*
<br />
<br />Denson: They are following!
<br />O'Connor: Are we losing them?
<br />Comm Officer: No sir!
<br />Denson: They must be fast!
<br />O'Connor: Increase speed to 9\10. If they follow are as fast as this then they must already have at least gunboats!
<br />Denson: The ship may fall apart!
<br />Harrison: We have lost all power on decks grey 5 to blue 14.
<br />O'Connor: Aye. We have to keep pushing!
<br />Comm Offcer: We are loosing them very slowly.
<br />O'Connor: If they stay in that formation then we an use it to our advantage!
<br />Johnson: They seem in same formation!
<br />O'Connor: Good, you will be our eyes in the back of the neck. Plot a course between those two suns!
<br />Navigator: Sir! Thats suicide! We will never make it through.
<br />Denson: We have to slow down. Or this ship will fall apart.
<br />O'Connor: Speed to 6\10. We have to make it through because it too late to turn around.
<br />Johnson: We lost some speed they are ganing up on us fast!
<br />Denson: Hold on thight, we need cooling teams on both sides.
<br />Harrison: Roger.
<br />O'Connor: Drop two combat drones!
<br />Johnson: Drones away!
<br />Harrison: Cooling teams are in place.
<br />Denson: About time. Hull temperature is rising fast.
<br />Johnson: Are those things suns?
<br />O'Connor: Yes.
<br />Johnson: I've seen alot, but cruiser going so closley between suns...
<br />Comm Officer: Combat driods are in place!
<br />O'Connor: Put them in defence mode. Now they have no change but to go around the suns and we gain some time.
<br />Johnson: They aren't going to break formation. 
<br />Comm Officer: Suns are blocking our readings. All sensors are useless.
<br />O'Connor: Speed?
<br />Denson: 6\10
<br />O'Connor: Drop to 2\10.
<br />Denson: Aye.
<br />Johnson: Two hostiles cut by drones. 3 burned in sun.
<br />O'Connor: Tehy are some serious kamikaze type persons.
<br />Johnson: Hostiles are changing course! Tehy are going around the suns!
<br />Denson: Time we needed...
<br />O'Connor: Speed to 0\10. and go to cruise on 750.
<br />Denson: Copy, reducing speed.
<br />Comm Officer: Captain, you were right. Tho we couldn't get ship types or anything there shoved up two capship power readings.
<br />Denson: Good we got out of there in time.
<br />Harrison: Hows the heat?
<br />Denson: Better, you can get back here now.
<br />O'Connor: Get everyone with injurys to medlab, if there are any.
<br />Harrison: Roger, captain.
<br />O'Connor: All personell, stay on stanby mode. We have about 2 hours.
<br />Johnson: I need the sleep.
<br />O'Connor: Ladys and gentlemen, full debrief at.. *he looked at his wrist watch* o six hundred hours. Denson take command.

<br />
<br />Michael was just enjoying a good beer with Lutz and Arrigoni, when the sirens started. The emergency lights added a kind of creepy atmosphere to the panic wich followed.
<br />Engineers and officers were running around like crazy.
<br />suddenly the voice of O'Connor crackled over the intercomm.
<br />
<br /><b>O'Connor  </b>: All hands to battlestations. Primary goal: Get the hell out of here.
<br /><b>Lutz  </b>: What in the world is going on here!
<br />
<br />Lutz grabbed the first guy he could get a hold of. It was a young engineer, they had all seen him around in the repairbay a few times. He wasn't around for very long, he joined the crew since the battle with the Arizona . he was a former Arrigosga and the poor lad was shaking with fear because of the suddden changed situation.
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz  </b>: What's going on?
<br /><b>Engineer  </b>: Ehm, I don't know, something, ehm about some hostile ships or so. Look, I gotta go, I have to report to the chief engineer.
<br />
<br />the guy ran of and Lutz turned to Michael and Arrigoni
<br />
<br /><b>Arrigoni  </b>: Rheinlanders?
<br /><b>Lutz  </b>: I don't know, what do you think Michael?
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: What do you mean? How should I know? For all I know it's some kind of alien force using host bodies of highly placed officials, using them to trigger a war between the four houses so they can take over sirius! (OOC: <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br /><b>Lutz  </b>: Wow dude, take it easy! I was just asking what you were thinking.
<br /><b>Arrigoni  </b>: Yeah, relax Michael. Why are you so tense?
<br />
<br />Michael took a deep breath and regained his calm.
<br />
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: Sorry guys, I...I don't know what happened to me.
<br /><b>Lutz  </b>: It's ok. Now we...
<br />
<br />But before Lutz could continue he was interrupted by Harrison.
<br />
<br /><b>Harrison  </b>: We need your help cooling the ships hull.
<br /><b>Lutz  </b>: Cooling? Why?
<br /><b>Harrison  </b>: Because we're cruising between the two suns in a few minutes.
<br /><b>Arrigoni  </b>: we're WHAT?!?! Has O'Connor lost it?
<br /><b>Harrison  </b>: we have some very fast and agile ships on our tail, this is the only way to shake them off, follow me!
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Against all odds, they actually made it through. Seemed as though the Vengeance  was a lot tougher then they realised.
<br />Michael was walking to the medlab. Although he had sustained some minor injuries, the heat had scoarched his arms a bit, he was rather save than sorry.
<br />On the way to the medlab he recieved a message.
<br />
<br />Message received: 20:75:55
<br />message ID: lh43cm2
<br />sender: &lt;Anonimous&gt;
<br />Subject: &lt;none&gt;
<br />&lt;message&gt; Mission completed, ship tagged.&lt;end message&gt; 
<br />
<br />Michael was glad that the &quot;tagging&quot; worked out as planned. 
<br />
<br />Tagging was a delicate process in wich a ship &quot;logs in&quot; to the target ships mainframe and places a sort of virus, wich sends out a hidden, encoded transmission to whoever owns the corresponding decoder. That person is than able to read the tagged ships location. But he needs to be close enough, not more than one system away.
<br />This type of tracking was virtually undetectable.
<br />
<br />Michael guessed that the current owner of the decoder was close, Probably in New Florance or New Rome. He didn't know who it was, because he had only been in touch with a messenger.
<br />
<br />He remebered being shocked by the offer, wich wasn't nearly as generous as it was neccecary. The messenger didn't tell him too much, but just enough to convince him to take the offer.
<br />It was insane actually, when he thought back at the Raider who told him the crazy story.
<br />He spoke to him after the incident with the Xeno's and O'Connor. While O'Connor was being towed to the Raiderbase in New Rome, The Raider, who called himself Shadow Knight, hailed him on a secure chanel.
<br />
<br />*Flash back*
<br />
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: Are you Michael Armstrong?
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: Why?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: We need your help, urgently. We got your name from a guy named Chip. He said we could trust you
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: Yeah, I know him. What is this all about?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: Ok, listed very carefully, I say this only once. The Liberty gouvernement is corrupted. They are using the Rheinland threat as an excuse to whipe out all criminal factions.
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: Ok, I don't have to listen to this...
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b> Please, I understand how crazy this sounds, but there is a true genocide going on in the house systems and the independed systems. Bering and Hudson have been completely whiped clean, all criminal bases have been distroyed and most are killed or captured. We don't know what happened to those, but we fear the worst. Only few have been able to escape, but we haven't been able to locate them yet.
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: You're saying Libety is responsible for all this?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: Not all, Rheinland has a part in it too. All Contacts with all criminal bases have been lost in Sigma 13, New Florance and most of the Omega systems. But Liberty took care of most of the independend systems.
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: But...Why? I mean, why would Liberty do this?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: It's both a coverup and a preparation.
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: For what?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: For an invasion by Rheinland and Liberty forces in Brittonia and Kusari.
<br />
<br />*Terrible Silence* Michael suddenly felt sick in his stomache and dizy.
<br />
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: My god...Are you sure?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: Yes, we intercepted encoded transmissions between the gouvernements of Rheinland and Liberty wich contain status reports, strategies and agreements. Both Liberty and Rheinland are cleaning up there systems, so to speak, to be sure that the criminals cause no problems.
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: But with all those superior weaponry, no criminal faction would dare to atack Liberty, let alone Rheinland. They have a massive fleet.
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: True, but carefully planned pinpoint attacks on strategic targets, can harm there infrastructure. With those massive battleships they can easily overrun Kusari and Britonia, but they invested all fundings in those battleships, wich left little for the regular forces, wich are equally as strong as the criminals, but less well maintained. Appart from a few fighter squadrons with improved weapons.
<br /><b>Michael  </b>: The unknown criminal faction. My god! The Fireblade and the Firestorm, they were not stolen, or sold by a traiter, they were exchanged between Liberty and Rheinland! I...can hardly beleve it. What do you want me to do?
<br /><b>Shadow Knight  </b>: Keep us informed. For the moment that's all, but we will contact you if we have an assignment for you. Don't tell anyone about this, at this moment you can trust nobody.
<br />
<br />Shadow Knight left and Michael headed towards Planet New Rome, where he would team up with Lutz and Arrigoni.
<br />ten minutes later he received his first asignment: Delay the Vengeance  and get it to Alpha Draconis.
<br />
<br />*end of flash back*
<br />
<br />Michael walked out of the medlab with both his armes taken care off. Just a few hours ago he was assigned to &quot;tag&quot; the Vengeance .
<br />He was glad he still had friends with the Lane Hackers, they were the experts in this kind of jobs.
<br />The tag had to be placed from the outside and couldn't be placed by using the systems mainframe, not undetecteble anyway.
<br />He regretted the loss of his friends, but knew it was for a good cause.
<br />Most criminal facions were wiped out, the Liberti Rogues, the Lane Hackers, Raiders, Budschuh, Arrigosha, Unioners and Hessians. They all had been under attack last few days. Of every faction only some survived, they were now combining forces to prepare for counterstrikes.
<br />Also, someone had to warn Bretonia and Kusari about the treat. But since all the jumpgates and jumpholes were now heavily monitored by both Rheinland and Liberty, that would be very dificult.
<br />
<br />With a troubled mind, full of mixed fealings, Michael walked into the bar where the debriefing had just started.

<br />
<br />Johnson stood alone in the docking bay. It was empty. Completely. No ships, no people, no equipment. He looked all around. Nothing. He turned around to go to the bar, but a Wolfhound that wasn't there before was there. He was compelled to go into it.
<br />
<br />Once in the cockpit, he realized that this was his Wolfhound. His personal Wolfhound. He was glad to be in it. This was his special ship, the <i>Resourceful </i>. He pored a year of hard work and suffering in this thing. And now it was back to him, like a lost child, perhaps. The airlock opened, as if he had commanded it to. He flew outside.
<br />
<br />There were eighteen battleships with their fighter escorts. They were waiting for him, it seemed. He took a look behind him. The cruiser that he had just come out of was turned into a large rock. A very large rock. It was Dawson base.
<br />
<br />Suddenly a fleet of Wolfhounds appeared from his top, bottom, left, and right, and engaged the fighters. Johnson sped to join in. He was the star of the show, so to speak. He destroyed an uncountable amount of fighters. He went to take on the cruisers.
<br />
<br />Some weapon was charging on each of them. His ship, specially rigged to fit two torpedo launchers, destroyed one with two salvos. But it wasn't enough. The beam that suddenly emerged cut through Dawson. It was a terrifying experience.
<br />
<br />Something in the corner of his eye caught his attention. He just knew, more through some kind of revelation than actual physical knowledge, that it was his love, Valerie. She was drifting aimlessly in space, headed directly for the great blue beam.
<br />
<br />Everything important to him was gone. He turned around, looking for a place to go. A mangled mass of parts headed towards him. And a smaller, but no less potent, blue beam was heading for him. It was coming very fast.
<br />
<br />I'm a goner, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />______________________________________
<br />&quot;Wahahawah!&quot;
<br />
<br />Johnson's alarm woke him up promptly at 5:30. He jumped out of bed because of a bad dream he had. He didn't remember what had happened, but he thought it was bad.
<br />
<br />Johnson pored over all the things that he had been asked to do. Get some help from the Rogues, become a mechanic, try to get some stupid metal plate out of the captain's hand. He also thought about what he had got himself into. A supermodified cruiser that the captain said was more than it looked, some big galactic battle between Rheinland and Liberty, a really mad man on the loose with some superfriggin gun. He felt depressed. Why didn't he go back home, where life was simpler? Go out and fight, get caught, go back, go out and fight, get caught, go back. It wasn't the best thing to be in, but at least he didn't have to think about all these big things. They were beyond him.
<br />
<br />Johnson pulled out a bottle of specialty wine that he had bought from New Rome and took a nice big drink of it.
<br />
<br />And then he was off to the briefing.
<br />
<br />He came back and took another drink.</div>

<br />
<br />Psawhn was feeling  rather left out. He didn't meet up with Lutz, Arrigoni, and Micheal at New Rome as planned. Even using tradelanes, crossing an entire system took quite a while. After emerging into orbit of the planet, the trio's transponders didn't show up at all on the contact list.
<br />
<br />He accessed the nearest tradelane for data on passing ships. Sure enough, barely two minutes ago, he read three freelancers entering this ring simultaneously. They must have passed eachother in the tradelane, Psawhn thought. He set the Neural-net to enter the tradelane in the other direction, while chiding himself for not paying attention.
<br />
<br />Upon reaching Vatican station, Psawhn checked the tradelanes, finding them gone off to the New Florence system. He was about to follow when his comm cracked open.
<br />&quot;This is RNC <i>Rache </i> to Freelancer Kappa three-dash-nine. Land on our cruiser and prepare to be taken into custody.&quot;
<br /><i>What? </i> Psawhn glanced at his contact list. &quot;Classified Rheinland Military Patrol&quot; showed up prominently on his list. Probably the same one he detected earlier. One cruiser, two gunboats, and a wing of fighters. Definitely not something he'd want to go up against. Even with that much, he could probably afterburn his way to the nearest tradelane, and get out of there. (Even then, Psawhn didn't know why he was so inclined to not be taken in.)
<br />But just as he started thinking about it, the cruiser launched three projectiles - each aimed at a separate tradelane ring. He saw the status on his hud go from 'active' to 'offline.' But why was Rheinland so intent on capturing him?
<br />&quot;I repeat: Land on the cruiser immediately, Kusarian.&quot; (<i>OOC: What's the proper word? </i>)
<br />That explained it. Psawhn had almost forgotten that there was quite a large bit of animosity between Rheinland and Kusari. Flying around in a Dragon was a way to attract quite a bit of attention.
<br />&quot;RNC <i>Rache </i>, this is Freelancer Kappa th-&quot; Psawhn was interrupted by a harsh blow to his shields.
<br />&quot;That was a warning shot. Land now or you will be destroyed.&quot;
<br />Psawhn sighed and moved his ship. He hoped that his Libertonian accent might do something. Sure, his accent wasn't Kusari, but his facial features showed enough of his father's heritage to be more than wary. Psawhn was sure that he'd be plunged into hell the moment he stepped onto that cruiser's deck. 
<br />No, he wasn't going to give up that easily. He brought up a tactical scan of the <i>Rache </i>. (It came up almost the moment he thought of it, but Psawhn didn't notice.) What he saw appalled him. Two <i>Stormblade </i> turrets, an <i>Avarice </i>, and numerous other non-standard weaponry. <i>Damn. It's practically a copy of the  </i>Vengeance. 
<br />Then Psawhn remembered Vatican station. It wasn't too far away. He quickly scanned the weapons of the two gunboats and the lead Valkyrie. The gunboat had more standard weapons, and same the Valk had two shield busters in an otherwise full stealthblade set.
<br />For his plan to work, he needed to take out one <i>Stormblade </i> and the <i>Avarice. </i> On the cruiser. The other Stormblade would be on the wrong side. Psawhn began to program two driller mines. 
<br />&quot;What's taking so long? Land already.&quot; Psawhn spotted the open docking bay hatch on the cruiser, then decided to program a third mine.
<br />At a distance of several meters to the landing port, he let loose all three mines, then afterburned towards Vatican station.
<br />&quot;All units, attack!&quot;
<br />A couple seconds later, two distinctive flashes of light burst open. He hoped that the weapons were disabled, then his thoughts were interrupted by a massive surge of light. <i>There goes the landing deck </i> he thought. Hopefully the deck was cleared of personnel.
<br />It didn't take a moment longer for the fire from the gunboat and fighter wing to start jostling his shields. Trying specifically to avoid the shield-killers, he weaved his way towards, and then practically through, Vatican station.
<br />In the small shadow, he charged up the <i>Seer </i>'s cruise engines. Four seconds later Psawhn was thrown into his seat from the sudden acceleration. 
<br />He watched his distance from the fleet increase out of weapons fire range. But he was interrupted by the warning of incoming Hornet Cruise Disruptors. There was only time to drop one countermeasure in the short second he had, and that only fooled three of the five missiles. Psawhn was thrown forward against his harness violently. So much for making the asteroid field...
<br />He turned around. One Dragon against five Valkyries. Not good at all...
<br />
<br /><i>OOC: In real-time, this is still before the  </i>Vengeance<i> makes it's 'suicide' run between the two suns. I'll try to figure out how to get out of this <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> </i></div>

<br />Denson: You thing we might be bugged?
<br />O'Connor: Never trust Liberty too much. I don't belive we are bugged, but after crossing liberty space we always need to check.

Johnson, u'll get the chef engineer place. Michael u'll get the rank of Flight Captain. Lutz - Flight Lieutenant. Arragoni - you know your way around in border worlds?
<br />ArrigonI: Yes, betteer than the back of my hand.
<br />O'Connor: Good you will be in charge of finding stuff we need from border worlds.  Pswahn... Pswahn... darn, I can't remeber his name...where is that guy?
<br />Arragoni: Daniel
<br />Michael: We last saw him in New Rome.
<br />Denson: You left a guy in New Rome?? How is that possible?
<br />O'Connor: We can't do nothing about it right now. All I'm worried about is that when he returns to the pickup zone. Vengeance  isn't there.
<br />Denson: IF he returns.. You guys did saw the Rheinland patrol around there?
<br />Lutz: Yes, but It passed throught the system. 
<br />O'Connor: OK, heres what we do: Arrigoni - you find us a spot where we could land this ship. Johnson - repair the ships we had to abandon to arizona and got later, Micheal - u go and see what happened to Daniel, Lutz - you'd better go with him, Harrison - let your teams search any scrap metal on board this ship, Denson - get those mirrors ready. I'll go with Michael and Lutz to New Rome and buy stuff we need for upgrading. Consider this debriefing over.
<br />Harrison: Sounded more like briefing.
<br />
<br />Later when Denson looked at his comm, Roger had left a message on it:
<br />I suspect that I will not get back when you land this somewhere so keep me up to date. Anyway don't forget to mount the newly construted cannon and put that homemade cloaking device. Anyway I'll be going to warn Matt and others in Bretonia, so you should be sending that message to HQ. ok? Don't worry I'll bing you a deck of cards so you can cheat more money out of crew. PS ask for more money!

			<h3><a href="#p199473" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content"><b>Lutz </b>: Michael, wait up!
<br />
<br />Michael had gone to the landingbay right after O'Connor finished his briefing. A lot went through his head and he didn't want too many people asking questions right now.
<br />But when Michael heard his friend, he waited for him.
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: So, you want to tell me what is going on?
<br /><b>Michael </b>: I don't know what you're talking about.
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: Come on Michael, you can tell me. You haven't been yourself ever since we came back from the distroyed base in New Florance. And after your litle outburst back in the bar, I just know there is something going on with you.
<br />
<br />Michael knew he couldn't fool Lutz. He'd never been good at hiding his thoughts from him. Even at Manhattan Lutz could always tell what was wrong. The problem was, he didn't know if he could trust him. So much had happened since they finished their officers training.
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: Well...Are you gonna tell me?
<br /><b>Michael </b>: it's complicated Lutz. I'm sorry, I just...I just can't tell you right now. There's things going on and I'm not sure can tell you, it might put you at risk.
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: Well, at least we'd be at risk together. 
<br />
<br />Lutz paused to see if he had convinced Michael. Michael hesitated
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: Look, If you don't want to tell me, that's fine with me. All I say is, I can see you're not allright. I'm worried about you man, that's all. If you're ready, I'm here for you. Just so you know.
<br />
<br />Michael stood and watched Lutz as he walked to the landingbay.
<br />There went Lutz, the one who was farther away from home than anyone else aboard the <i>Vengeance </i> and still he managed to put the values of other before his. Michael felt bad about himself. He promised Lutz and himself to be there for him when he needed him, but he didn't feel like he was living up to that promise.
<br />It was sh!t like this that got him drinking before and would get him to go back to drinking again if he wasn't carefull.
<br />He knew he had to tell Lutz about the situation, but not just yet, not as long as they weren't alone.
<br />O'Connor passed Michael and as he did, he tapped him on the shoulder.
<br />
<br /><b>O'Connor </b>: Come on Michael, we got a job to do.
<br /><b>Michael </b>: Yeah, I'm comming.
<br />
<br />*Michael, Lutz and O'Connor leave the Vengeance *
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: I sugest we go and check at New Rome first, that's the last place Daniel was seen.
<br /><b>O'Connor </b>: My thoughts exactly. Lets hope he's allright, there was that Rheinland gunboat patrol passing through you know.
<br /><b>Michael </b>: They went to Sigma 19, they haven't been spotted since.
<br /><b>O'Connor </b>: Remember the beacons we placed? Some of them actually picked up some Rheinlanders about a half an hour ago.
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: We'd better hurry then. I'll lead the way. You two form up behind and keep your eyes open in case there are more of those criminals following us.
<br />
<br />Ironicaly, Michael, who had the best scannerrange, picked up a wing of Raiders on his scanner. They were far behind, far enough to stay undetected by any standard scanner, but close enough for Michael to see them.
<br />
<br />The jumphole was clear and they all went through. They came out in the Venice Icecloud and Michael couldn't help but to think about the newsreport he read about Terranova's parents being killed. Where was Terranova anyway. No news is usually good news, but somehow Michael sensed it was not the case, not with Terranova.
<br />
<br /><b>Michael </b>: Vatican Station coming up shortly guys. 15K to go and no sign of any bad guys.
<br /><b>O'Connor </b>: Do you see Daniel by any chance?
<br /><b>Michael </b>: Nope, not a sign. In fact, I don't detect any ships at all, or Vatican.
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: That's strange, try to hail them.
<br /><b>Michael </b>: Vatican Station, this is freelancer Omega three dash five, I'm requesting to dock...Vatican, are you there?
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: Nothing?
<br /><b>O'Connor </b>: This doesn't feel good at all.
<br /><b>Michael </b>: Ok guys, we're coming out of the cloud, we should be able to see Vatican now.
<br />
<br />10K away from Vatican, the cloud cleared and revealed a sight they would not soon forget.
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz </b>: Oh, my, god.
<br /><b>O'cOnnor </b>: *Wistled*
<br /><b>Michael </b>: What now?
<br />
<br />In front of them, where Vatican used to be, two Rheinland battleships, a cruiser and four wings of fighters were sitting in space. Vatican was still there, but all of it's functions were disabled.
<br />They hadn't detect them...not yet.

			<h3><a href="#p199494" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">One Dragon versus five Valkryies. Not good at all...
<br />
<br />Psawhn wondered how to manage this. He couldn't run, for the asteroid field was much too far away. He could surrender, but he was determined not to be captured by those... those... <i>huns. </i> (He kicked himself for using such a term.) That left only one option.
<br />
<br />Turning on full thrusters, he aimed himself straight for the nearest Valkryie. The Rheinland wing hesitated - perhaps they were shocked to see a lone ship charging at them. <i>Or, perhaps they're laughing their arses off, </i> Psawhn thought grimly. He was pressed flat against his seat due to the acceleration. He did have a plan, though. The last time he tried this, he ended up plunged into the middle of an undercover war between pirates, liberty, and rheinland. And he still didn't know which side he was on.
<br />
<br />Even before entering minimum weapons range, Psawhn let loose a couple missiles and unleased full weapons. It didn't take long for the rheinlanders to do the same. He quickly pitched down, while his neuralnet kept the guns trained on the Valkryie. Five streams of energy dissapated directly over his shields, but only a couple of them glancing on them. Psawhn kept heading as straight as he could towards the lead Valkryie while dodging fire, and keeping the neuralnet aiming the guns.
<br />
<br />The wing was about 100m away now, and Psawhn's 200m/s plus the Rheinlander's 80m/s meant that they would pass in a fraction of a second. Psawhn cut his engines, then rotated as quickly as possible. It was a near miss for the two ships, but they passed cleanly just as the two missiles slammed into the Valkryie's shields, which overloaded the generator and failed the shields.
<br />
<br />Now presented with a clear view of the Valkryie's backside, he used the neuralnet to fire on both of its engines. A second later, that Valkryie was crippled. <i>Now, if only I could replace this weak stunpulse with one of those Avarice guns, </i> he thought. But he was interrupted by the newly returned firing of the two outermost wingmen. They had started breaking off before Psawhn had made his run, and as such were the first to bear on Psawhn. Obviously they were trained very well.
<br />
<br />Deciding to work on disabling the left Valkryie, Psawhn opened fire. Strangely enough, the Valkryie moved directly into a vunerable position. He didn't think on this, however, and just kept firing. Without the help of missiles, the Valk's shields were depleting more slowly, but he still kept hammering away.
<br /><i>This is much too easy, </i> Psawhn wondered. Prompty the <i>Seer </i> shook violently as three sets of weapons impacted his ship. Evasive maneuvers, combined with mines, didn't help, and Psawhn watched the status on his shield generator charge drop to zero very rapidly.
<br />&quot;Shields failed.&quot; <i>No duh, </i> he thought miserably.
<br />The vibrations that were present these last few seconds increased a hundredfold as the lethal energy beams started raining down on his hull.
<br />
<br />It's funny how time slows down when you think you're in the last moments of your life. Psawhn could watch, in detail, his port fin fly off, the individual sparks becoming indistinguishable from stars. He could feel every impact of the dozen energy charges. He even thought he could hear the millions of nanobots desperately trying to hold the hull together by reparing the same spot of hull over and over after each weapon blast. Psawhn could see a familiar bright flash of light, and knew it was over. He waited for the end.
<br />
<br />It never came.
<br />
<br />It took Psawhn a few moments to realize that that last flash of light didn't come from his fuel cells. Then his hull started rattling again as thousands of tiny particles impacted his unshielded hull. These were muted as the shield generator restored his shields, having taken enough energy from the batteries.
<br />
<br />Another bright flash of light followed. Psawhn had no idea what it was, until he saw the remains of a Valkryie floating by. He checked his radar. It showed two fleeing Valkryies and a disabled one, and one other ship. Psawhn turned to look, and let out a low oath.
<br />
<br />It was Terranova.

			<div class="content">OOC:Kick ass post, Whasp.  Now, I'm going to have to retype my post which I typed just before this one and then the server screwed up.
<br />
<br />
<br />The Avarice guns had reached one hundred percent readiness.  The Hornvipers, shields, and engines were green and ready to go.  Quigley checked his panel once more and keyed his comm.  &quot;This is Mu Leader, engines lit and guns in green.  Mu flight ,call it as you get it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Mu Three here.  All green and good.&quot; Rachel said with her eternal cheerfulness.  How she could go from chirpy banter to the cold,ruthless stick goddess she was in combat, Quigley didn't know.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Mu Two reporting in.  All systems are at optimium levels.&quot; Penn's rigid formality reported.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mu Five.  All systems and subsystems are operating above spec.  Got a new toy I wanna try out.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Mu Four.  Everything checks out.  Ready to launch.  Five, when did you have time to make a new toy?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I've been working on it for the past couple of days.  I finished it while Lead was checking  out Pirate Queen.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Flight, Lead.  Cut the chatter.  Especially you, Five.&quot;  Quigley rolled his eyes as he switched from the flight's private channel to the Survivor's channel.  &quot;Flight Mu is ready to launch.&quot;
<br />
<br />Jezebel came back in the crackling tone of a ship's comm, &quot;Mu Leader, this is Survivor Leader.  Roger your launch.  We're ready to launch also.  Yours plus mine will give us thirty fighters.  It's all we have.  The only other ships are evac freighters.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Got it, Survivor Lead.  We're launching.&quot; Quigley flipped back to the flight's channel as he took the Valkyrie Maiden  off the platform.  &quot;Alright, Mus.  We've got fighters in three minutes.  Repeat: three mike.&quot;
<br />
<br />As Quigley slammed the throttle foward and the Maiden  shot into the air, Penn came over the comm  in a calm, clear tone.  &quot;Leader, Two.  I must protest this action.  You are acting outside the jurisidiction and scope of the Liberty Navy.&quot;
<br />
<br />Quigley answered back in befuddled anger, &quot;Two, there isn't time for Parlimentary procedure.  There's two zero heavily armed Valkyrie Advanced heading this way.  We can't dick around.  The Survivors are counting on us now get in gear.&quot;  Quigley turned his fighter towards the oncoming Valk Adv's, leaving the platform far behind.  Rachel, Wolfie, and Jimmy followed him in loose formation.  Penn straggled behind.
<br />
<br />&quot;Two, Three.  Hey, wingman, Get back in formation.  We've got orders to stop the Rheinlanders, and they're less than a minute out.&quot; Rachel said with her cheerfulness absent.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, Three.  Those are illegal orders from an illegal chain of command.  That has been mended.  Captain Matthew Quigley and Lieutenants Lyta, Wolf, and Yalbourgh, you all have been found guilty of conspiring with the enemy.  The only suitable punishment is death , Quigley, your name has always been a disgrace to the Navy.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Penn passed out judgement with the same eerily calm tone.  He was acting like Jimmy had on the landing pad with the Survivors.  Jimmy had been like that because he had an ace of his pocket.  This seemed strangely the same...
<br />
<br />Quigley's eyes shot wide open, and he hauled the stick to his chest to quick loop.  &quot;Mus, break!&quot;  The Mus scattered at the warning as four columns of light stab into the space they had occupied a second before.
<br />
<br />&quot;Geez, Fireblades and cruiser class at that.  Five, have anything?&quot; Quigley said as he juked to keep from getting a Fireblade accurately targeted on him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lead, the first cruiser isn't in firing position.  I got a new contact directly above us.  Uh...it's a cruiser...id coming.  Grave's black bones!  It's a Liberty cruiser.&quot;
<br />
<br />Quigley felt like the galaxy was crashing down on him again.  He was again out of the Navy.  Now he was the enemy of his home.  He had twenty Valk Adv's in firing range and he couldn't get off a shot.  The Survivors were wide open.  As Quigley thought that, four more Fireblade bolts stabbed down from the sky.  This time they were aimed at the pirate base.  The makeshift base disappeared in a flash of flame and destruction.  A wailing no came from Jezebel as she saw her defenseless people disinigrated.
<br />
<br />The galaxy was now properly in its upside down postion.  Not that this was unusual for Matthew Quigley.  He just wished it would stop.  He could make no more wishes because he had to throw the <i>Maiden  </i>  into a sickening spin.

<br />O'Connor: They have really improved that cruiser class vessle.
<br />Lutz: And I thought rheinland had only gunboats.
<br />Micheal: Ah! We are here to find out where is Daniel, not to gaze theyre ships.
<br />O'Connor: oh, Yeh, guess we can't ask them where Daniel is.
<br />Lutz: Micheal, can you detect anything?
<br />Micael: Some of those ships seem to be disabled and theres alot of scrap metal floating around.
<br />Lutz: A firefight?
<br />Micheal: Possible. A weird thing is that the cruiser has turrets torn apart on only one side.
<br />O'Connor: Like somebody would have dropped a huge bomb near that side?
<br />Micheal: Yeah, something like that. But those Battleships have not a scratch on them.
<br />Lutz: Like they never enganged...
<br />
<br />*Two Rheinland fighters start moving to Micheals location, aparently thinking that he is the leader of three newly sighted frelancers.*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Weapons ready?
<br />Lutz: Exactly my plan.
<br />Michael: Lets wait and see what do the rheinlanders do before making anything agressive.
<br />O'Connor: Oh ok.
<br />
<br />*Rheinlanders stopped right in front of Michael*
<br />
<br />RH pilot: Identefy yourself, freelancer.
<br />Micheal: We ar...
<br />O'Connor: Mind if I take over?
<br />Micheal: No not at all.
<br />O'Connor: We are ambassidors on diplomatic assignement from Liberty.
<br />RH pilot: Oh, and where are you heading? 
<br />
<br />By the sound of Rheinlanders voice it was understandable that he didn't belive Roger.
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Its calssified. But as I know we are in good relations with Rheinland I'm willing to tell you that we are here by the order of Logan Pierce.
<br />RH pilot: Did you bring his answer?
<br />O'Connor: Yes I did and the answer is yes.
<br />
<br />*Rheinlander seemed to have calmed down.*
<br />
<br />RH pilot: Ok, we just wanted to know if you have seen anything suspicious here latley.
<br />Lutz: *sounding very important* Although I don't want to speak anybody with your rank I am willing to tell that we are looking for a escaped prisoner.
<br />RH pilot: Well, sir then I think we might work together as we are looking for the same person. Follow us!
<br />
<br />*Rheinlanders headed back to battleships*
<br />
<br />Michael: Have you been to any of those diplomatic schools after academy?
<br />O'Connor: Niceley played Lutz!
<br />Lutz: Thanks. And no, it was totally natural.
<br />Michael: What answer were you talkin about?
<br />O'Connor: I haven't got a clue, but if it made them happy then why not?
<br />Lutz: Its always clever to use your opponents resources in your own gain.
<br />O'Connor: Now you are sounding weird to even me. Better lets follow them.
<br />Micheal: Yes, otherwise they might think that we are not so friendly afterall and your work was for nothing.
<br />
<br />*They followed rheinladers*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: By the way I brought some Explosive packs with me. There isn't a problem that can't be fixed without the correct amount of explosives.
<br />Lutz: And you think we are in a problem right now?
<br />O'Connor: You might never know.
<br />
<br />*about that time they were passing some of the ship wrecks that were just like torn apart*

			<div class="content">Lutz, Michael and O'Connor landed on the rheinland battleship to find out what are rheinlanders doing here and do they have Daniel.
<br />
<br />O'Connor: I'll go and see where to put theese expopacks, don't forget - you are working for liberty and rheinlanders are friends.
<br />
<br />*By saying that Roger dissapeared behind a door. Right about then another door opened and Rheinland battleships captain stepped inside along ith his two assistants*
<br />
<br />Rheinland Captain: Let me introdouce myself. I am Captain Heindrich von...
<br />Lutz: Enough of this, I need to speak they man who is in charge of this thing.
<br />Heinrich: That would be me.
<br />Lutz: In that case I would like to know if you are holding a prisoner named Daniel Morlone in custody?
<br />
<br />*Michael shiverd when he heard that, thinking that this may compromise them.*
<br />
<br />Heinrich: You will get your answer ambassidor. AFTER you tell me the demands of Logan.
<br />Lutz: You are in no condition to make demands here.
<br />Heinrih: Oh, and whos fleet is around you?
<br />Lutz: Rheinland fleet, not yours.
<br />Heinrich: I am part of rheinland.
<br />Lutz: A tiny part.
<br />Heinrich: I see that you know your place in the setor, sir. Lets go to the brig and see if you frind is there.
<br />
<br />*Micheal was relived when the conversation ended. As they were walking tworward the lockdown brig Mihael whisperd to Lutz*
<br />
<br />Micheal: Damn you! You scared the living daylights out of me.
<br />Lutz: Good, I always thought that ambassidors were scary type of persons.
<br />
<br />*As they reached the brig, Roger showed up near them.*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Any luck ambassidor?
<br />Lutz: They are checking the brig.
<br />Micheal: Where were you Roger?
<br />O'Connor: Can you belive how hard is to find a restroom in here?
<br />
<br />*As they searched the list Daniels name didn't apear anywhere*
<br />
<br />Michael: Damn!
<br />Heinrich: As you can see we don't have your prisoner, but we would like to assist finding him if you would give us the information we need, ambassidor?
<br />Lutz: And what information would that be?
<br />Heinrich: Is Logan Pierce, your forgein minister accepted our deal?
<br />Lutz: As we told you before, he has.
<br />Heinrich: And what are the conditions?
<br />Lutz: I may be important, but not that important.
<br />Heinrich: And what about your companions?
<br />Lutz: Security. The best and most loyal men ever found on Liberty grounds.
<br />
<br />*As soon as Lutz said it Roger had hard time not starting to laugh, when Michael, saw that he turned to Lutz to get attention off Roger.*
<br />
<br />Micheal: Sir, we have our schedule.
<br />Lutz: Ah, yes. We must go now, but we will deffenetly let you know hen we ned help finding our runaway 'friend'.
<br />
<br />*By saying that Lutz and his companions moved out of the room. Heading what they thought was fighter bay. Only later did they understand why Heinrich started laughing when they left.*

			<h3><a href="#p199870" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">OOC:hehe...really long post coming up.  I just got in the writing &quot;zone&quot; and kept going.  I just wanted to resolve the RNC/Survivor thing and get Quigley on his way back into the main plot.  Get some coffee.  Tape you eyes open.  This one will take a while to read.  Enjoy while you're still concious.  ::falls out of chair::
<br />
<br />Quigley straightened his ship and slammed the throttle to its stops.  Then he jammed the button on the side of the throttle to activate the afterburner.  Quigley was pushed back into his chair as the <i>Valkyrie Maiden    </i> jumped forward.  He tossed the stick from side to side to avoid the green Rhienland bolts streaking on either side of him.  He felt the ships shudder as hits hammered into the shields.
<br />
<br />The Valk Adv was getting close, playing with him.  The Rheinlander closed to 300 meters and let off another burst.  Quigley's shields were quickly dwindling to nothing.  Quigley looked at the range indicator.   It decreased to 250 meters, and Quigley pulled out all his power and engaged reverse thrust.  The Valk Adv pumped more kilojoules of energy into the <i>Maiden   </i> as it roared past.
<br />
<br />The Valk Adv flew right into Quigley's sights, and Quigley smiled.  He pulled the <i>Maiden's  </i> first trigger in its strange split-trigger design back to the position of the second trigger.  The Avarice guns hummed as their gatling barrels spun up to speed and threw out a flurry of blue ion bolts.  The aft end of the Valk Adv's glowed blue as its shield tried to dissipate the ion energy.  The generator flashed and blew as it failed.  Quigley pulled the twin triggers back all the way and the <i>Maiden's  </i> complement of Hornvipers roared as they joined the Avarice guns.  The Valk Adv melted away under the onslaught and exploded.
<br />
<br />Quigley smiled lopsidedly.  One down, nineteen to deal with...  &quot;Mu Lead, break starboard!&quot; Quigley's celebration was broken as he banked heavily to the right.  He snapped his head around to look over his right shoulder and saw a Stormblade bolt slice across his wake.  A Valk Adv followed the blast which was in turn pursued by a crimson Hawk with all guns blazing.  Quigley kept in the bank to keep behind the Valk and Hawk.  The red pirate fighter must have already dropped the Valk's shield because he could see the Hawk fire converge on the Valk's engines.  The engines detonated and the Valk dropped from the sky.  The Hawk, which Quigley id'ed as Survivor Lead, followed the ship down pouring fire into the doomed ship.  &quot;Survivor Lead, it's done.  Leave it&quot; Quigley insisted over the comm.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, damn you!  Every one of these mother-loving Huns has to die in the same way as my people.&quot;  Jezebel said venomously.
<br />
<br />&quot;Survivor Leader, they're gone.  You've got to let that one go.  He's going to be a greasy spot in a second anyways.  You've got the Survivor's fighter wing to cover.  They're getting the hell kicked out of them.&quot; Quigley answered.  Jezebel didn't answer but slewed her ship around and dove back into the cloud of dogfighting ships.  Quigley followed her, but watched for he was needed most.  
<br />
<br />He saw a Valk drop behind a rickety Bloodhound.  The nose of the Valk glowed as the super weapon lodged there charged up.  The fiery red bolt of the Fireblade jumped out from the Valk and cut the Bloodhound in half.  Before the Valk could turn to find another target, a Defender dropped into its path.  The Defender fired a torpedo at close range and broke off.  The Valk hadn't the time to avoid the torpedo and was enveloped in a mighty explosion that only chunks of molten metal and debris exited.  &quot;Splash two for Three.  Yeeehaaw!&quot; Three yelled over the comm.  
<br />
<br /><i>Damn, she's good, </i> Quigley thought.  &quot;Three, stop playing by yourself.  You're my wing.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Gotcha, Lead.  Like the old days, right?&quot; Rachel said in a beaming tone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger old days, Three.&quot; Quigley said with a smile.  Ever since his cosmos had collapsed with Ten's death, he'd been alone and had missed the safety Rachel had provided in some of the hairiest dogfights of his stint at West Point.  The two swept though the cloud, blasting any hostile that crossed their path.  They got one Valk, damaged another, and grazed two more before they burst out the other side of the cloud of ships.  
<br />
<br />Quigley looked down at the list of friendly ships.  The Survivors and Mus were down to fifteen ships.  That was half their original number.  They had only managed to get five Valks.  Fifteen Valk Advs and one traitorous Defender were out there shredding the Survivors mercilessly.  Quigley looked up to see a wing pair of Valks bearing down on them.  &quot;Three...&quot; Quigley didn't need to say more before Rachel dove out of the way.  Quigley jinked right to get out of their way and fire and then jinked left to disappear behind them.  The two split and banked around to get on Quigley's six.
<br />
<br />The two never got around onto him because a pack of Survivor Wolfhunds converged on the hapless Valks and shredded them with a multitude of flickering lances.  The pirates whooped over the comm at the piles of falling debris.  The celebrations were cut short as another Valk wing pair impaled the pack with Fireblade blasts and scattered surviving pirates.  Quigley shook his head at the sacrifice the pirates had performed for him.  He quickly searched Atka's debris and explosion riddled skies for any sign of Rachel and the other two.  Rachel had hooked up with a damaged pair of Bloodhounds.  She covered them while they did mass fire runs on any Valk close enough.  Jimmy and Wolfie were tangling in the middle of four Valks.  They were talking up a storm.  Quigley took a quick second to listen to the pair and quiet them if necessary.  He had a minute or so until a Valk discovered him all alone.
<br />
<br />&quot;Five, are you ready yet?&quot; Wolfie asked a little annoyed and frustrated.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nope.&#8221; Jimmy answered offhand as if in deep concentration.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Kid, we&#8217;ve had three perfect shots already, and you passed them up.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;This thing isn&#8217;t proven.  I might only get one chance at this.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah yeah.  You haven&#8217;t had time to experiment and put it through its paces.  Just shoot damn it!  Their grouping up again for another slash.&#8221;  As Wolfie had indicated the four Valks had grouped in a line abreast and were diving down at the pair of Defenders.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Keep your suit zipped, Four.  Targeting&#8230;firing.  Blast visors down, Four!&#8221;  Quigley looked at Jimmy&#8217;s fighter, confused.  The Defender&#8217;s shields glowed, went opaque, and emitted a huge, blinding flash of light.  His distance from Jimmy&#8217;s fighter was the only thing that saved him from being utterly blinded.  Through the myriad of spots in his vision, he could see the Valks weren&#8217;t that lucky.  They all collided with each other in reaction to being blinded.  &#8220;Ha!  It worked, Four.  That surge I sent through my shield system worked perfectly as a flash-bang, but I don&#8217;t think I can do it again.  I&#8217;ve still got shields, but I can smell melted wiring.&#8221;
<br />
<br />	&#8220;That&#8217;s fine ol&#8217;wingmate of mine.  That was a toy to top all of your toys.&#8221;  Three chuckled.  Quigley had been around some unusual people.  His friends back on the Vengennce  were always pulling stuff from their magical top hats, but these two topped even them.  Quigley shook his head, and got his mind back into the fight.  The Survivors and Mus were dwindling down seven fighters.  His Defenders were flying well but they were starting to take damage.  Even he had gotten some holes in his hull, but nothing bad.  No critical systems were damaged.  The Huns had nine fighters including Penn. 
<br />
<br />	&#8220;Speaking of Penn&#8230;&#8221; Quigley hissed as he spotted Penn below him, slagging a Hawk that had been limping out of the battle.  While relieved that the Hawk hadn&#8217;t been Jezebel&#8217;s crimson ship, Quigley&#8217;s eyes still glowed in anger at Penn&#8217;s cowardly opportunism.  Quigley dove down on Penn&#8217;s Defender.  Grinning, Quigley lined up Penn in his crosshairs, but before he could pull the trigger, Penn veered off at a right angle.  Quigley pulled up in tight Immelmann turn to put himself directly over Penn&#8217;s fighter.  Quigley rolled the <i>Maiden </i> over so it was inverted and switched over to an open channel.  &#8220;Penn, if I&#8217;m a disgrace to the Navy, I&#8217;d hate to see the Navy that trained you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />	Penn answered by turning his spoiler turret up at Quigley and firing a string of bursts at him.  Quigley scoffed and throttled back a little.  He rotated his Avarice guns up to target the Penn&#8217;s turret below him.  Quigley tapped the first trigger quickly and the Avarices spewed out a dozen or so bolts each.  Penn&#8217;s shields collapsed after the first eight bolts and the rest slammed into the turret which sparked a shower of sparks and went dead.  Penn slowed down abruptly.  Quigley quickly followed suit to keep from shooting out in front of the traitor below him.  As the two fighters, one inverted on top of the other, jockeyed for position, Penn applied shield batts to raise his shields.  &#8220;Quigley, you damn Houston cowboy, stop jacking around.&#8221; Penn spat irritably.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, yippy-kai-yaay mother&#8230;&#8221; Quigley was interrupted as Penn tried to slow down and speed up to throw him off.  Quigley glanced down at his sensor panel which had started to beep incessantly as someone was trying to get a lock on him.  Quigley traced the lock back to his attacker and grinned at the id of his attacker.  The evil cogs in his head spun and Quigley grinned maniacally.  Quigley looked up at Penn.  Penn was looking up at him, making rude gestures.  Quigley grinned more as he keyed his mic.  &#8220;I bet I&#8217;m still a main target of that cruiser up there. But after those first shots, we&#8217;ve all been too close to your  fighters for the cruiser to get another clear shot.  I&#8217;ve been flying in the open for way over a minute now.  Now for something completely different, do you know how you&#8217;re like a plate of Eggs Benedict?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s this childish crap, Quigley?  Fine, I&#8217;ll play your game.  It&#8217;s named like a traitor and I&#8217;m a traitor to your sick, twisted mind?&#8221; Penn said, torqued off and feeling superior.  Quigley glanced at his scanners that reported a weapon locked on and fired at him. Perfect timing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No.  Both of you get scrambled at one point in your short existence.&#8221;  Quigley rolled the inverted the <i>Maiden </i> right onto his left wing.  Quigley instantly pulled the stick to his chest to execute a G-heavy left bank.  Penn sailed on forward when a column of light dove out the clouds like Zeus&#8217;s lightning bolt.  Penn yelped over the comm as the cruiser-fired Fireblade bolt the size of his fighter enveloped him.  There was no explosion, any matter had been atomized.  Quigley said nothing as he turned back to the battle.  He saw the explosion of the final Survivor Wolfhund.  The only friendlies left were his pilots and Jezebel.  Rachel and Jezebel were working hard to keep the Valks off each other.  Wolfie was protecting Jimmy&#8217;s fighter which was trailing black smoke and sparks.  There was one Survivor hawk missing a wing that crawled along the ground, trying to escape notice.  Around his pilots and the pirate leader boiled seven Valks in relatively good condition.
<br />
<br />Quigley saw Fate closing in on him.  Two cruisers orbited above the planet.  One was trying for potshots.  He had a handful of damaged ships with weary pilots against a larger, superior force with little or no damage.  Quigley steeled himself for his coming death.  This was going to be his last stand.  He could only hope the Rheinlanders thought back on this fight with respect, and Liberty felt foolish talent such as his pilots&#8217; and his.
<br />
<br />Quigley&#8217;s noble rationalization was interrupted by Jimmy&#8217;s tired, but confused voice, &#8220;Lead, something going on up there.  The cruiser is separating.  Now, it&#8217;s expanding.  Holy&#8230;IT&#8221;S EXPLODING!&#8221;  Jimmy yelled in renewed hope.  &#8220;New contact entering sensor range.  Another Liberty cruiser.  Id coming through&#8230;it&#8217;s the cruiser <i>West Point </i>.  What the hell?&#8221; Jimmy reported now confused.  &#8220;Wait, the Hun cruiser is stopping.  It&#8217;s&#8230;turning.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The Valks&#8217; final runs on their adversaries dissolved as they turned tail and sped away.  Quigley might have ordered a pursuit, but his people weren&#8217;t in any position to do it.  Even Jezebel, filled with survivor&#8217;s guilt and pure rage, was too exhausted to put up a chase.  &#8220;Okay, people.  They&#8217;re probably being recalled to cover the RNC cruiser.  Form up and let&#8217;s get out of here.  Anyone have cockpit damage?  Answer if you&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;  That meant that the cockpit was breached and the pilot would be unable to go into the vacuum of space.  No one answered, and the tired Defenders and two Hawks fell slowly into position behind the battered <i>Maiden </i>.  The group began a lazy climb out of atmosphere.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mu flight, this the cruiser <i>West Point </i>,&#8221; reported a familiar and firm voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good afternoon to you too, Admiral Evans.  Since when did Liberty naming conventions name cruisers after military academies?&#8221; Quigley said with a tired attempt to make a joke.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good afternoon, Captain.  To answer your question, Liberty hasn&#8217;t changed naming conventions.  We commandeered this ship to come save you.  Now get on board.  We have others to save.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Commandeered?  What?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story, Captain.  I&#8217;ll tell brief you when you get on board.  I want to be out of this system an hour ago.  Get you rear in gear, kid.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Aye, sir!&#8221; Quigley answered with as much vigor as he could muster out of his exhausted body.  The mismatched and battered flight left Atka&#8217;s atmosphere entirely and flew toward the glistening <i>West Point </i>.  Quigley watched as Jimmy and the one-winged Survivor Hawk landed first because of the severity of their damage and the possibility of injury.  Then Wolfie followed his wingman.  Jezebel cautiously inched toward the cruiser.  This was a day of crushing defeats and uncomfortable happenings.  Landing on a Liberty cruiser, even a renegade one, was disconcerting for her.  Rachel followed the pirate queen into the hangar.  Quigley watched all his pilots land before he set himself into the landing pattern.  He was exhausted, confused, and furious, but he was safe again.  Safe until the Huns tracked them down again.  
<br />
<br />Quigley&#8217;s hands started shaking as he set the <i>Valkyrie Maiden </i>  on the deck.  It was his adrenaline starting to recede and lose effect.  Quigley had to concentrate hard to keep focus to shut down his fighter.  He completed the checklist and hit the button to raise the canopy.  Quigley tried to unbuckle himself, but his strength failed him.  Quigley slumped down into his chair.  A tech would be along shortly, and a pair of them would lift him out and hand him over to the medics.  Then he would be okay.  He thought all of this right as he passed out of exhaustion.

			<div class="content">(OOC: bit of a post here, have fun!)
<br />
<br />Lutz and O'Connor had scared the hell out of Michael. Were they nuts, pretending to be Liberty diplomats? But what was more scary, they were actually expecting Liberty diplomats to bring them an answer about a certain deal they have with Liberties foreign minister, Logan Pierce.
<br />If Michael ever had any doubts at any point about the story of the Raiders to be true, he now knew.
<br />They were flying away from the Rheinland fleet and came across an area scattered with remains of a battle. Michael scanned the site for anything wich might come in handy.
<br />
<br />*thinks* Well, look at this, an Avarice.
<br />
<br />Michael grinned as he tractored in the gatling gun, He would get this thing mounted on his ship the first chance he got. He needed better guns anyway. A better ship would be nice too, but there had been no opportunity to get one.
<br />He heared a short monotone beep as he received an incoming call on the secure channel. Michael opened the channel.
<br />
<br />Lutz: Any bright ideas on where to go?
<br />Michael: Well, after that stunt you two pulled on that battleship, we can be sure they are gonna keep an eye on us. Maybe the best thing to do right now, is to get out of this system. I sugest New Florance and check the remote mining operation there if we can find Daniel.
<br />Lutz: O'Connor, you have access to the detection system we put in this system, does it keep a log?
<br />O'Connor: Yes, I'll check it to see what it detected. *a moment passed* Well, he was here near Vatican station, together with a wing of Valk Advanced.
<br />Michael: That explaines the Avarice I picked up back there.
<br />Lutz: But Daniel wouldn't stand a chance against those Valks.
<br />O'Connor: Not unless he had some help guys.
<br />Michael: What do you mean, he was rescued?
<br />O'Connor: Well, he did make it out of the system alive, but I wouldn't say he was rescued. He was with Terranova!
<br />Lutz: What?
<br />Michael: You're kidding right? I mean, I hope you are kidding. No one could take on Terranova all by himself.
<br />O'Connor: There is no indication that they had been fighting eachother. Last logentry with Daniel and Terranova has been about an hour ago at the beacon near the Sigma 19 jumpgate. Good chance that's were they went.
<br />Michael: Ok, then we will go there too.
<br />Lutz: It might be best if we stay clear of any tradelane or jumpgate. It will register us and I bet the Rheinlanders are keeping an eye on those too.
<br />Michael: Very well. There is a jumphole to Sigma 19 on the far side of planet New Rome.
<br />O'Connor: We'd better be on our way then. Michael, lead the way, we'll be right behind you.
<br />
<br />Michael kicked in his cruise engines and set the autopilot for the Sigma 19 jumphole.
<br />Sudenly Michael realised something; Rheinland had move part of his fleet into New Rome, wich could only mean two things. Either The New Italian Congress had joined the Rheinlanders, or they had surrendered to the Rheinlanders, knowing they were not strong enough to win a war against such a power. Michael loged in to the New Roman planetary News server and found immidiatly what he wanted.
<br />
<br /><i>Planet New Rome.
<br />Last night the New Italian Congress surrendered to the Rheinland Authoriries, after a short, but fiery debate between the Chanselor and President Stalone. In a pressconference Stalone declared that the &quot;Italian navy is in no way equipped to take on the Rheinland navy in a full scale war&quot; and ensured that he surrendred merely to save the lives of hundreds, possibly thousands, of Italian citizens. The opposition disaproved of the surrender, stating that such an easy surrender was a clear sign of the lack of spine one needs to lead a nation in desperate times. Marin Scorsese, former CEO of Scorsese Industries who lost the elections three years ago to Stalone, went one step farher by calling the Prime Minister a defectant who cowardly betrayed his people to save his own live. All of the Ministers and congerss man have been releaved of duty and have been placed under supervision by the Rheinland Gouvernment. The Chanselor warned that any form of protest, whatsoever, would be struck down without a warning.... </i>
<br />
<br />The message went on, but Michael knew enough. New Rome and New Florance were not save anymore.
<br />
<br />Michael: Lutz, O'Connor, have you read the news?
<br />Lutz: No, what's happened?
<br />Michael: I'll send you a message.
<br />
<br />While the others were reading, Michael checked his scanners to see if there was a patrol nearby. They couldn't risk being discouvered. All reemed to be clear, for the moment.
<br />
<br />Lutz: My god Michael, if this is the current situation, we have to warn the <i>Vengeance </i>.
<br />O'Connor: Don't forget Quigley, he's in the middle of all this since he was re&#239;nstated. I'll contact the Vengeance  and tell them to go to the Sigma 19 system and see if they can get a message to Quigley, although I don't know if that's save or even possible since Liberty is probably checking all channels for any criminal interaction.
<br />Michael: Good, lets hope it's not to late. Ok, jumphole comming up shortly. Hold on...I'm detecting two wings of Valkyries.
<br />
<br />Michael cut down his cruises and slowed down to a complete stop. They were in open space and the Valks probably detected them allready. Michael did a quick scan and noticed the Avarices, two on each Valk. backed up with Stealthblades and a Torpedolauncher.
<br />
<br />Lutz: Advanced?
<br />Michael: Very advanced.
<br />O'Connor: Come on you whimps, we can do this.
<br />Lutz: Are you crazy?! There is only three of us against eight of them and who knows what they're keeping behind.
<br />O'Connor: Christ, what have they been teaching you on that Officers training, nitting sweaters? We only need to make it through the jumphole. You have a Fireblade, don't you Lutz?
<br />Lutz: Yes, but...
<br />O'Connor: Very well, Michael and I will take care of their shields and you finish the job with your Fireblade. Lets go.
<br />
<br />O'Connor sped up to max speed and Michael and Lutz followed.
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Ok, on my mark, break formation.
<br />
<br />The Rheinlanders formed up in to two groups of four. One wing was heading straight for them, while the other wing was making it's way to get behind them.
<br />O'Connor got into firing range and send away a few missiles and started pounding away the shield of the first Valk. Michael did the same with a second Valk, but before he finished the shield he had to bank hard to the left to prevent a collission. He quickley droped a few mines. One of them cought the Valk in it's magnetic grip and pulled itself to the Valk. The bright explosion that followed took away the last bit of shield and Lutz finished the job with his Fireblade. 
<br />
<br />With two of the Valks gone, the odds were a bit more even. Two Valks for each of them and Michael picked out two of the Valks, wich at first tried to sneak up from behind.
<br />Before he could fire, the Avarices on the Valks started spinning and very soon the fast moving ionbolts started working his shields. He pulled his stick allmost through his stomach as he pulled up to evade the shots. Halfway through the loop he targeted one of the Valks wich was turning around to line up for a second run.
<br />Michael quickly checked his shieldstatus and drained a few bateries to get his shield to 100%. He fired a missile as he let out a burst of lasershots and this time it was the Valk who had to evade, but Michaels Falcon was more agile and he was able to stay on the Valks tail. 
<br />Michael targeted the shieldgenerator and fired. He strugled to keep the Valk in sight as the pilot tried to shake him of his tail, but Michael was able to disable it's shields before the he moved out of targeting range. Michael dropped another mine and hoped it would home in on the valk. He turned around and saw the Valk was lucky.
<br />Sudenly another valk came out of nowhere and flew straight into the mine. The explosion was to much for the crippled Valk and the pilot screamed as it burst apart in flames.
<br />
<br />Lutz: Nice shooting Michael.
<br />Michael: Thanks. Watch you six!
<br />
<br />Two Valkyries were locking on to Lutz and started to take down his shield. Michael rushed to help his friend and locked on to one of the Valks. He targeted the engines and fired a missile. The explosion disabled the engine and set the Valk in a terrible spin in the direction of Planet New Rome. Michael didn't pay attention to it. He had allready targeted the secon Valk who had turned around to take on Michael. Michael was quicker and had taken down his shields before the Rheinlander could return fire. Michael banked hard Right to give Lutz, who was now lined up with the shieldless Valk and let his Fireblade do it's terible job.
<br />
<br />Lutz flew past Michael and raised his thumb. Michael answered the gesture and side by side they lined up to finish the last Valk. O'Connor Had strugled a bit and apriciated the help. The remaning Valk didn't stand a chance and very soon it was over.
<br />
<br />Michael: Pfew, that was close. Is everyone ok?
<br />Lutz: I'm fine. A bit tired perhaps and I used up a few bats and bots, but other than that I'm fine
<br />O'Connor: Me too. Though I'm a bit low on ammo. I dropped quite a few mines.
<br />Michael: Well, let's hope we don't run into any trouble. The jumphole is only 5K away from here, we should be save now. lets go.
<br />
<br />*They left the battle site and went through the jumphole.*
<br />
<br />Lutz: Ok, what now. Where do we go from here?
<br />O'Connor: I instructed the Vengeance  to make it's way to this system but I haven't received any return message yet.
<br />Michael: Ok, then I sugest we make our way to Luxury Liner Hawaii. It should be relatively save. We can rearm and repair what's necesary and plan our next step.
<br />
<br />Michael set course for the Luxury Liner and leaned back in his seat. He closed his eyes and tried to regulate his breathing. It was a nice way to relax and very soon he felt better.
<br />He looked around to take in the scenery. Two big suns in the center and a huge planet marked this system. He had never been so far out of house territory.
<br />Sudenly the comm crackled and Lutz' voice came up.
<br />
<br />Lutz: Hey Michael, wake up. We got company.
<br />
<br />Michael immediatly checked his scanner. It showed three Stilletoes on an intercept coarse.
<br />
<br />Michael: Hessians.
<br />Lutz: Here? I thought they limited themself to the Rheinland systems.
<br />O'Connor: This shouldn't be too dificult. Three Hessians, what do you think Lutz, are you up to it?
<br />Lutz: Very funny, lets here what they want first.
<br />
<br />The Hessians closed in and halted at 1K, staying out of firing range to appear non-hostile.
<br />
<br />Michael: This is freelancer Omega three dash five to Hessian leader, state your business.
<br />Hessian Leader: This is Hessians Gold Three. We are here to escort you to Malaga base, it's a deserted research facility.
<br />Michael: On who's authority?
<br />Hessian Leader: On Frederick May's authority.
<br />Michael: Frederick May?
<br />Hessian Leader: He told us you would remember him.
<br />Michael: Oh yeah, I remember him alright. What's the old dog up to this time?
<br />Hessian Leader: He want's to tell you himself. We have to hurry though. Now that Rheinland invaded Italy we can only guess how long it will take before they start to atack Kusari and Bretonia. We need to act quikly.
<br />Michael: What do you think guys?
<br />Lutz: Seems as though it's our only option.
<br />O'Connor: Right, it's better than nothing.
<br />Michael: Very well. Hessian leader, lead the way.
<br />Hessian Leader: Good, form up.
<br />
<br />Lutz: Michael, Who's this Frederick May anyway?
<br />Michael: He's the leader of the Lane Hackers. I've known him since my escape from Liberty. He's the best in programming and hacking into systems and stuff. He personally teaches all of the Lane Hackers all the tricks.
<br />O'Connor: I knew I heard his name before, there has been a respectable bounty on his head for over a decade now.
<br />Michael: Yes, he's a legend. He's being respected even among most other criminal factions. It'll be good to see the old dog again
<br />
<br />They reached Malaga base. 
<br />
<br />Michael: Is that the Vengeance ?
<br />Lutz: You're right.
<br />Denson: Hey guys, glad you made it.
<br />O'Connor: Well, I'll be damned. How the hell did you get here?
<br />Denson: Thanks to the great help of our friends here. We were under atack by several wings of Xeno's when these guys showed up. Just in time. They brought us here. Land on the station guys, the rest is there too. I'll join you later, I have some work to do here.
<br />O'Connor: Do you need any help with that?
<br />Denson: Not for the moment, we seem to have everything under control.
<br />O'Connor: Ok, good luck.
<br />Malaga Control: This is Malaga Base to Rescue operation, you are all cleared to dock.
<br />Hessian Leader: Thanks Malaga. Go ahead and land.
<br />Michael: Rescue operation?
<br />
<br />Michael, Lutz and O'Connor landed on Malaga Base.
<br />The landing site was quite crowded and it was dificult to find a clear spot between the equipment. Michael found a spot near a very suspicious looking fighter.
<br />
<br />Michael: Be carefull Lutz, Terranova is here too.
<br />Lutz: Yeah, I saw his ship, this should be interresting.
<br />
<br />Michael, O'Connor and Lutz got out of their ships. They saw a man walking up to them. He was tall and bald and very muscular. Michael imediately recognised him and smiled. and walked up to him, his hand streched out.
<br />
<br />Michael: I should have known. How are you Freddy?
<br />May: Michael, glad you made it. I'm fine, but unfortunately there is litle time to chat. Things are escalating very soon and in a short time there is nothing we can do to stop Rheinland and Liberty.
<br />Lutz: Liberty too? What's going on?
<br />May: I'll explain in about an hour. We're still waiting for the West Point  to arive. They will be here shortly.
<br />O'Connor: The West Point ?
<br />May: Yes, It carries Luitenant Quigley and a few loyals.
<br />Michael: Quigley, thank god he made it.
<br />May: Ok,  I have to go to the bridge now. All our resousces ae at your desposal and the bar is that way. Briefing starts in an hour in the bar, see you.
<br />
<br />Lutz: just now that I thought I had this all figured out, it gets trown back in my face and I can start figuring it all out again.
<br />O'Connor: I'm with you Lutz, First it's Terranova, Rheinland and some criminals we're fighting and now It's Liberty too and and Terranova is here? Man I need a drink.
<br />Michael: Well, a drink it is. I got a fealing it's the last good drink we can enjoy in a for time.
<br />
<br />(OOC: I think this is enough for now.)
