<br /><b>Journal entry one   </b>:
<br />
<br />Another day. Just like the first. I had come here for a little R and R. You know the type. Get some sun, swimming and just plain, laying around. I was scheduled for three months here. Here, strange name for an unnamed island in the middle of no where. But, that was the idea.. I would be putting pen to paper with the stories I have had up until now. The first week was just setting up a camp. I chose a location off the beach. I did not want to be spotted by anyone on a boat passing by. The island itself, was barley a mile long and three quarter of a mile wide. It did have a fresh water source that made it perfect. I had arranged to have food drops every two weeks.
<br />
<br />The first landed on the water near the shore, which made retrieving it a snap. It was mostly caned goods as not much fresh things would survive this warm climate. I had some coconuts and bananas on the island and the occasional fresh fish, if I was lucky. That meant can foods most of the time. But it was the challenge that counted the most. 
<br />I was able to get several oil lamps set up, that way I could write into the night. That seemed the best time. It was cooler and the sound of the waves, played in with what I was writing.
<br />
<br />The roof took some work to keep out the rain. The first night, I was not happy being awaken with pelting rain over my bed. It took a little work weaving the fronds the right way to water proof it, but, I managed. It was something that Mustang had taught me a few years ago. He was a good teacher. I wish I had known what happened to him. Had not heard from him two months before leaving. His last letter indicated some kind of trouble. Nothing after that. It has me worried, even here. 
<br />
<br />The sunset tonight was as beautiful as ever. The colors, spectacular. It looked just like the sun dropping into the water. But, this time, I noticed something different. A ship entering the sun. It looked to be on fire as the sun sank. There was no turning toward the island, but it kept it&#8217;s course. Then, with no warning, an explosion. It destroyed the ship, nothing left. Fire burned only from only small pieces of wood that floated, but nothing bigger than my bed. Could anyone have survived? I would not know for some time. I just hoped they would be ok. I had no way to contact anyone until the next drop, and that was two weeks away.
<br />
<br /><b>Journal entry two  </b>:
<br />
<br />Morning brought fog today. It was a little unexpected. I dressed and ate fast, heading towards the beach. I wanted to see what would wash up from the ship explosion. Only small bits of decking and other things that survived the fire, and one other thing, a large pile of what I at first, assumed were rags. But as I got closer, the rags moaned. It was a man. He looked burned in the left side of his body. He had gashes in his right leg as well. 
<br />
<br />I ran back to the hut and got my first aid kit and my knife. On the way back, I grabbed a couple of long poles that I could use to make a litter. He didn&#8217;t look as if he would be able to walk. I knelt next to him and looked to the gash first. It needed cleaning in the worst way. 
<br />
<br />After getting it wrapped, I set the litter out and reached to roll him over on it. I was getting him tied down when I looked at his face. I knew that face, It was Mustang. He had a beard now, bu, other than that, he looked the same.. I secured him to the litter and picked up the harness and began to drag him back to camp.

			<div class="content">After getting it wrapped, I set the litter out and reached to roll him over on it. I was getting him tied down when I looked at his face. I knew that face, It was Mustang. He had a beard now, but, other than that, he looked the same.. I secured him to the litter and picked up the harness and began to drag him back to camp.
<br />
<br />After getting the tracks wiped out, she went back to check on Mustang. Something bad had to happen to get him this far, as well as the explosion. It looked like it had caused his injuries. They would heal, given time and attention. He needed medical help, but that was out of the question. It would be up to her to take care of him. She was also worried that the explosion was not an accident, and if so, who would come looking for him. It would remain a mystery until he regained consciousness.
<br />
<br /> The next day, after checking Mustang, sw headed to the beach to do a little fishing. She needed the protein and could make a fish stew as well and give the broth to Mustang. He was delusional all night, sweating and turning as if fighting a foe. She stayed up part of the time, wiping his forehead with a cool cloth. She tried to get him to take some water, but he would not. He would dehydrate soon.
<br />
<br /><b>Journal entry three </b>:
<br />
<br />I managed to get three fish. More than enough for a days meals. After getting them cleaned and gathering more fire wood, I returned to camp to find Mustang setting up. After putting the ish down, I checked on him. His gaze told be he was still out of it. He showed no recognition of me. I did get him to drink some water and to lay back down. He lay there watching me work. But, never uttered a word. I wondered if he had lost his memory in the explosion. After the stew was started, I noticed he had turned over on his back and was asleep. I lit the torches and got a bok out to read and sat beside him, reading. 
<br />
<br />When I moved to stir the stew, he spoke, &#8220;Who are you&#8221;, eyes half awake. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;My name is sw, do you know who you are?&#8221; I asked back.
<br />
<br />There was no replies. He had fallen back asleep. It was for the better, he had a lot of healing to do. And then, a lot of answers to give, and if anyone knew he was here. He could be in danger here, and that meant I was as well. I decided in the morning to check the beach to make sure there was no signs of the wreck or of me being here. I did not want to chance a boat coming near and seeing anything.
<br />
<br />Morning brought rain. This would hamper things a little. I wrapped a coat and headed to the beach. Only a few pieces that had to be removed. I tossed them onto some brush. It would have to do for now. If any one came by and saw a clean beach, they would not think anyone there and keep on going by. I hoped so at least. I picked some bananas on the way back and planed to do some writing today. Not much else possible while it was raining.
<br />
<br />When I got back, mustang was gone. I dropped the food and grabbed my walking stick and headed back out. As I had just come from the beach I could mark that off and headed inland. I had to find him and get him back to bed. 
<br />
<br />After half an hour, I found him. Just sitting in th jungle, awake, but dazed. I called his name, he looked up at me, &#8220;sw, is that you, what are you doing her, and for that matter, where the heck am I&#8221;. I just laughed as I helped him to his feet and back to the hut.

			<div class="content">After half an hour, I found him. Just sitting in th jungle, awake, but dazed. I called his name, he looked up at me, &#8220;sw, is that you, what are you doing her, and for that matter, where the heck am I&#8221;. I just laughed as I helped him to his feet and back to the hut. We talked for nearly two hours. Why he was here was never reached. E sat back down on the bed. He looked so worn out, as if carrying a burden. 
<br />
<br />After another good nights sleep, Mustang was ready to talk a little more He spoke of more treasure hunting. In fact, he said, he had found another recently. Gold coins from a Spanish wreck. He was planning to donate them to a museum when a buyer approached him. He said he was offered a lot of money for the coins, but he decided not to sale. That was when things went south. He was threatened that if he did not <i>decide </i> to sale, it would go very bad for him.	
<br />
<br />He had finally to give the coin to the museum, but asked them to say nothing of it and he took a ship to another area, until things calmed down. Half way on the voyage, some one commandeered the ship and lay in another course, that took it past this island. He tried to wreck the engine, but, the one who took control if the ship, hit a fuel line and Mustang was barely able to make it topside before the fuel hit the boiler. That was the explosion that I had seen. As far as Mustang new, the man died with the ship, but, his friends would come looking, soon.
<br />
<br />I explained it would be nearly a week before the next supply drop, so until then, we were on our own. We would have to improvise a defense, just incase someone did show up. Must of the work would have to be done by me as Mustang was in no shape for it right now. So, I set out to locate a place that we could head to for safety. It would be a last resort.
<br />
<br />Mustang was busy trying to come up with ideas for weapon, if it came to that. They would be primitive. But, it was hoped that help would be here before the trouble arrived. He was counting on more people than just the two of them. They would need it to survive. 
<br />
<br /><b>Journal entry four </b>:
<br />
<br />Time came for the next drop, and still no trouble. Our luck seemed to be holding. I heard the sound before I saw the plane. It was a sea plane this time, not the cargo one that was bringing the supplies. It came in for a landing and headed for the beach. After shutting down the engines, the cargo door opened. To my surprise, Spix stepped out. Talk about a sight for sore eyes, my father shows up here. Then two others step out. Indy and Finalday. I must have had a strange look on my face. &#8220;Spix asked, &#8220;You look like you&#8217;ve seen a ghost, are you ok?&#8221;
<br />
<br />I shook myself and replied, &#8220;I&#8216;m fine, just surprised, that&#8217;s all&#8221;and continuing, &#8220;Dad, what are you doing here?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I had a feeling, if you know what I mean, that you were in trouble and called a couple of people to help, and well, we&#8217;re here&#8221; He said, smiling ear to ear. I walked over to him and gave him a hug and smiled at the other two. The smiled back and then ducked into the plane to retrieve the supplies. All in all, they had food, and weapons, and tents too. They were prepared to stay a while. Which was a comfort. We headed to the hut as I explained the situation. Spix looked at mustang, from time to time. The lane started up and moved off to take off back to the base. Dad had said it would be back in a week to check up on us.
<br />
<br />At camp, Final and Indy set up another tent for them and Spix set one up for himself. After setting out and opening the supplies, he sat on a log and addressed Mustang directly. &#8220;What&#8217;s your story, and why is sw in danger?&#8217; anger rising in his voice.

			<div class="content">At camp, Final and Indy set up another tent for them and Spix set one up for himself. After setting out and opening the supplies, he sat on a log and addressed Mustang directly. &#8220;What&#8217;s your story, and why is sw in danger?&#8217; anger rising in his voice. Mustang explained both the current circumstances and the other meetings. He explained why the people would probably be coming after him. This did little to calm Spix, but, he was a little more understanding. He even agreed to help with any potential defense that was needed. In the mean time, he got on the short wave and made a call to some friends. He was glad he brought it with him now.
<br />
<br />He had to admire the spunk of sw. She rarely ever backed down from a challenge. The was no exception. He knew she wanted to help a friend as much as he would. So, he put it behind him and got out some paper and pen and worked out a defense for the camp. Afterward, he headed down to the beach for a swim. The weather was beautiful and the sky, cloudless. A light breeze cooled and dried him as he sat on the sand. He looked down the beach about two hundred yards, Mustang was fishing, he guessed for dinner. sw had told him in a letter that Mustang was a god fisherman. Dusting himself off, he headed down the beach to talk to him again, his time, though, a little calmer.
<br />
<br />Final headed to the water hole to get a couple of containers of water. They wanted to have plenty in camp in th advent of an emergency. Indy was seeing to the camouflage around the tents. They would be too recognizable to any walking by. He used fronds from the palms to make them blend in more. It would help them from being easily seen from a boat. They also had to make sure the wood they used was dry to keep the smoke to a minimum. 
<br />
<br />Later that evening, as they sat around the fire, the fish that Mustang caught, sizzled over the open fire. It smelled wonderful. Conversation was light, and colorful. All laughed tonight. It eased the tension. There was a discussion as to weather it was better to stay rather than leave, but the truth was, that who ever wanted the coins would come after Mustang no matter where he was. Here among friends, was the best place to be to wait for them. That way, this could be put to rest, once and for all.
<br />
<br />Night and sleep came soon enough. All were tired, but also ready for what ever came. 
<br />
<br /><b>Journal entry five </b>:
<br />
<br />I woke before the others and went for a walk. I left a couple of pieces of kindling on the fire, so it would be burning when I got back. The sun had not risen yet, but there was a light near the beach. I moved through the cove growth, until I could get a clear view. Then I saw them. Six men, dressed in what looked like suits, sharply dressed a that. They were in a boat being rowed toward the shore. They had a lantern on the bow, which explained the light I had seen. He ship was anchored about two hundred yards further out. Others walked the deck of what looked like a yacht.  At least it was not an armed ship. I had to get back and wake the others. I don&#8217;t know if we could hide mustang and bluff them or not. I would leave that to Spix.
<br />
<br />Spix was just getting up when I arrived. He had noticed the fire now and thought something was up. I quickly threw some sand on it to put it out quickly. Spix went to wake the others and we had a hushed conversation. It was decided that we would try to bluff them first. But failing that, Mustang would be watching from the rocks, armed to the teeth and would lay down cover fire so we could escape.
<br />
<br />Final and Indy both took pistols that were tucked in the pants waist band with their shirts out to cover them. They were to head to the beach as if to fish. They would arrive just before the boat land and would &#8220;welcome&#8221; the visitors. This was, hopefully , to distract the men and set them a little more at ease. They would say they were dropped off here fro some R &amp; R and would be picked up in a few more days. 
<br />It would still be risky, but I would ten walk down dressed for a swim. That at least would set them at ease, if a woman was there. Then they could work on why they were there and try to get them to leave. The risk to me was greater, but I had an advantage as well. I could always head into the surf to escape.
