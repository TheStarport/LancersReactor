			<div class="content">I just wanted to add for all you people out there this is a LOVE it or leave it Freelancer forum. So don't say you don't like the game not even a little bit. I got done with the SP side of the game in three day's. It's not very hard and you CAN'T just play other missions and not play the single player missions, you can for a short time and then it will not let you take other missions untill you play a SP mission. The game was fun BUT not 50$ worth of fun and there is reall not any point to keep playing unless you want to max your level out and get the largest ship and the best weapons. The only missions you can do is fly here and blow this up or kill this guy, you might have to bring something back with you. Even the MP is only deathmatch. I pre-ordered this game almost a year ago and only paid 29.00 for it and even then I feel ripped off. I say once more the game was fun, just not that much fun and not very hard. If some one asked me if they should buy this game I would say no, wait untill the bargin bin. Once more I say the game was OK nothing more. Don't bother writing a reply I am done with this forum I just wanted to state my feeling for the game. Thank You.</div>

			<div class="content">Internet troll
<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. 
<br />
<br />On the Internet, a troll is a person who posts messages that create controversy or an angry response without adding content to the discussion, often intentionally. Though technically different from flaming which is an unmistakable direct personal attack, trolls often resort to innuendo or misdirection in the pursuit of their objective, which is to create controversy for its own sake, discredit those with whom they disagree, or sabotage discussion by creating an intimidating atmosphere. 
<br />
<br />Note: this is a highly subjective term as, naturally, everyone is affected differently by the nature of the term deemed a &quot;troll&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Originally this term applied to people who were intentionally posting flamebait, by analogy with the fishing technique of trolling: metaphorically, these people were dragging a conversational lure through the group, hoping for a response. The concept of &quot;this person is trolling our newsgroup&quot; became shortened to &quot;this person is a troll&quot;, and picked up the association of the monster trolls of folklore. 
<br />
<br />Trolling mostly maintains its earlier meaning of posting messages specifically in order to elicit a particular response, usually anger or argument. 
<br />
<br />The noun form, troll, is sometimes used in the more general sense of someone who stirs up controversy, whether or not the controversy itself is their goal. 
<br />
<br />Frequently this is used to discredit one position in an argument. By asserting that one's opponents are trolls, one is asserting that they are only maintaining their position in order to feed the flames, and that their position is actually indefensible. This use of &quot;troll&quot; is however then an ad hominem argument, and is itself thus usually indefensible - most correct views have historically met with opposition, so the label &quot;troll&quot; used this way is actually more likely to indicate a correct but controversial position that is stirring up flames precisely because it has challenged a doctrine others actually realize is wrong. 
<br />
<br />That said, it is quite possible to stir up controversy with a wrong argument - but these can more effectively be met by simply responding to the substantive issue. 
<br />
<br />It is safer to use the term &quot;troll&quot; to apply only to insubstantial irritation: 
<br />
<br />
<br />Common types of troll messages: 
<br />
<br />off topic messages -- &quot;Can anyone help me make a webpage?&quot; &quot;No, this is a music forum.&quot; 
<br />inflammatory messages -- &quot;You are an idiot for including this type of message in your list.&quot; 
<br />messages containing an obvious flaw or error -- &quot;I think Star Wars is Roman Polanski's best movie.&quot; 
<br />An example of a troll message in the newer sense would be one that denounces a particular religion in a religion newsgroup -- though historically, this would have been called &quot;flamebait&quot;. 
<br />
<br />A variant of the second variety (inflammatory messages) involves posting content obviously severely contradictory to the focus of the group or forum- for example, posting cat meat recipies on a pet lovers forum, posting evolutionary theory on a creationist forum, or posting messages about how all dragons are evil in the USENET group alt.fan.dragons. 
<br />
<br />There is some generally-accepted wisdom about dealing with Internet trolls: &quot;Don't feed the trolls, that will only encourage them.&quot; That is, do not respond to them, that is the attention they desire. Somebody who does respond to them is likely to hear &quot;YHBT. HAND.&quot; from other members of the group, which means &quot;You have been trolled. Have a nice day.&quot; 
<br />This is not what I did. And as you can see by the last persons comments this is a love Freelancer or leave it site. My comments were just comments. any one that posts a reply I can see would be very easy to get into a bar fight, that is if you are old enough to get into a bar. Thank You. Now Shut up.</div>

			<div class="content">Raven you are hilarious. Truly entertaining.
<br />
<br />I should start counting the number of times you have contradicted yourself. The fact that you returned to the forum to see reponses to your own message, even though you distinctly said you were now done with this forum, is priceless.
<br />
<br />Nice cut and paste by the way. I guess I have been trolled since I have been drawn into your controversy, but it's just too entertaining not to. Sorry to all those who are getting frustrated with this thread and the one prior, but Raven is providing me with too much laughter not to continue to point out his blatent idiocy. Ah, such fun.
<br />
<br />Raven, did you even READ that definition. How about this part:
<br />
<br />&quot;A variant of the second variety (inflammatory messages) involves posting content obviously severely contradictory to the focus of the group or forum...&quot;
<br />
<br />Now, I'm not sure if you can understand that sentence since there are quite a few really big words in it, but basically it means &quot;If you post a message on a forum that is FOR one thing, and your message is obviously AGAINST that thing, you are a TROLL!&quot;
<br />
<br />Ok, here's the challenge Raven. Try ACTUALLY leaving the forum and the game. No really. I want you to dig deep down inside, where those hardened opinions of yours have been forming, and summon up the courage to stand by your convictions by ACTUALLY going away and not responding anymore. See if you can do that.
<br />
<br />Good luck.
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">I think a few people in this forum need to realise that some of the people here posting bad remarks about the &quot;Freelancer&quot; game, are not just new forum members who have just purchased the game for the first time. But are in fact previous Starlancer owners, who have been waiting years for this new release. Yes I understand that this is a Freelancer Fans forum. But the bottom line is there are people here like myself who enjoyed Starlancer, and got much more playabilty out of the game. Much of that due to the great Multiplayer side of Starlancer.
<br />
<br />So if a person has been coming here for while, waiting for the release of Freelancer! And is then disapointed in the game. You can't really knock him for posting his feeling here about that, In time he will move away from the forum if he feels the game is that bad. I accually think most people here were expecting an auwful lot more from the game, than they are letting on if truth be said. Come guys! 3 days play for a Space Game sucks big time! And it not as though the Multiplayer side of Freelancer is worth bothering with to make things last that bit longer. Starlancer wiped the floor with this game, and thats saying something. For that game was also short lived. But compared to Freelancer it lasted Eons!
