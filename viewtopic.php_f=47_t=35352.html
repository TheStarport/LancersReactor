			<div class="content">here is the first chapter 505 words:
<br />Hunter 2 (exploring Freelancers underworld):
<br />
<br />Chapter 1:
<br />
<br />Freedom, it was gone at the turn of the 11th century, Rhienland Waged war on Kusari, Bretonia attack Liberty, Liberty allied with Rhienland. After 20 years of war, few were left to fight and so the war just ended. The strongest formed clans and took over the Government, in 1067 AE A(after earth) the houses were rebuilt but government policy was changed. But a brave group of &#8216;super humans&#8217; better called the Elite of the Elite. Enhanced beyond any human they were a sub-race of humanity. They attacked new Berlin system, with massive warships, and took the System. But the surviving navy of Rhienland destroyed the jump-gates and collapsed the jump-holes. But in a odd coincidence a shipment of gasses and explosives crashed into each-other and a &#8216;off&#8217; jump-hole was born. People went through but never came back. They the hunters realized that using a set amount of chemicals they could make the jump-hole go to any system they wanted&#8230;.
<br />
<br />Speed up about 30 years 1109 AE and if you go to New Berlin and enter a bar that&#8217;s were you will find me. Who am I? A hunter, in fact I am captain of a 8 man ship, proud father of two 9 year old kids already enrolled in the finest schools. Who am I? I am one of those who was on the legendary raid to New York, Liberty. I am a hero among my people, when ever some one sees my ship &#8216;Dawn&#8217; they flee for there lives. My name? Herrian Watts Third House Line of Arion Watts. Some may know that name, some scoff and say it&#8217;s a myth. The hero who saved our land from certain death, a boy who started fighting at 14 and won the greatest war at age 16. But the greatest Thing I stole was his personality. After the war Arion recorded his personality into a hologram of him. It has a memory bank so it knows who we are, no one can figure out how he did it, but we think it was a piece of alien technology.
<br />
<br />But I have something a bit less then that, but to others a bit more then that. I have his ship, I never let it leave the hangar. Oh did I mention our families space station, that&#8217;s right we own a small space station that&#8217;s were Arion&#8217;s fighter is. My kids love it there, something about 0 gravity fighting that they love. My family is one of the greatest houses in the Hunter empire, we have great money and some of the greatest warriors. I was even offered to be a captain of a 2000 crew warship but I said no, I prefer a few men you can rely on. At 14 my sons will enter the army and will server aboard the Dawn. The following will be my exploits in the following war we are about to wage

			<div class="content">Chapter 2 A liberty ace:
<br />
<br />Derik Vern, Was flying through the Badlands with his buddy, Hans, Weaving through big chunks of rock and ice  and cracking jokes. They were flying when they spotted a outcast ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hans to starboard, outcast bearing on target pick up the rear.&#8221; Derik said &#8220;This is patrol 666 to west point, requesting back up ASAP.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Roger devil patrol, ships sent to your mark. What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; West point said 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We got one outcast but by the way he is flying he is leading us to some friends, I doubt me and Hans can take 6 outcasts or so&#8221; Derik said sounding desperate.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sure thing Devil patrol, we send in a Cruiser but you know the badlands!&#8221; Wes point said
<br />
<br />&#8220;okay west point&#8221; Derik said as gulped with fear &#8220;hurry&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh my god!&#8221; Hans said &#8220;West point Derik, we found the ambush alright but not 6 try 20 circling this jump-hole, but here is the thing the jump-hole is flashing or something. We need big help ASAP&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I see it ,I see it&#8221; Derik said &#8220;They got Hans! My wing has been blown off I amretreating west poi-&#8220;
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is west point do you read? Devil patrol?&#8221; West point said desperately &#8220;This is west point to all fighters I repeat west point to all fighters uploading area to your net proceed there and kill the outcasts ASAP patrol 666 has gone down in there&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Herrian! Were reading multiple contacts on the other side of the hole!&#8221; a Lt. Said aboard &#8216;Dawn&#8217;
<br />
<br />&#8220;that&#8217;s not good!&#8221; I said &#8220; put up a EG high def shield, that will interfere with the location of the hole.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes sir!&#8221; the Lt. Said
<br />
<br />&#8220;if they find us to early, the war will fail&#8221; I said
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then&#8221; the Lt. Said proudly &#8220;we die a hunters death&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I wont let my kids not be able to dance on the graves of fallen foes. No we must interfere with this before its to late!&#8221; I said in a worried tone. I was not ready to attack liberty. But when we did, every human would fear the hunters.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Help me, anyone help me this is patrol 666  I have no wings on this ship and my air supply is going down, help!&#8221; Derik cried
<br />
<br />&#8220;West po&#8230;.. 66&#8230;. All figh&#8230;. ASA&#8230;. Patrol.. 66&#8230; ASA..&#8221; the radio crackled in Deriks ships, but he didn&#8217;t hear, he was dead.

<br />
<br />Chapter 3. Over the top:
<br />&#8220;Captain on deck, all you mugs wake up&#8221; a Major yelled proudly as Herrian walked aboard his 8 man ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Gentlemen I have some good news and some bad news&#8221; Herrian said loudly &#8220;The good news is, as the Bretonians say I, were going over the top.&#8221;
<br />
<br />All the men cheered at the prospect of attacking liberty. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;the bad news is a have been transferred&#8221; Herrian said softly and sadly. &#8220;your good men and your  new commander will be great. I am going to be captain of a 3000 man warship, so be proud that your loyal captain will shatter the bones of any enemy who dares fly in our way&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We just wish we could have had one last great battle with you!&#8221; A Lt.  Said
<br />
<br />&#8220;The civil war? Remember the great and final charge of the rebels, we were front row, taking the worst.&#8221; Herrian said remembering days long ago &#8220;but don&#8217;t worry, tonight at my orbital manor, we will feast and my new ship will be coming by. I did you one last favor, admiral wanted to split you up, but I refused.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Captain, rather then dinner how about we go over the top alone?&#8221; The Lt. Said &#8220; a little scout mission?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, no those days are beyond me. What I will do is have you be my wingman, beside  the &#8216;new dawn&#8217;.&#8221; Herrian said with a smile. &#8220;Now set a course, for my manor. Theres a shooting range and I can show you my plunder, Arion watts himself&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;sir this may seem a bit odd&#8221; The major said with a grin &#8220;but I don&#8217;t like to see corpses before dinner&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;don&#8217;t be a fool lad its not a corpse&#8221; Herrian said nearly laughing &#8220;it&#8217;s a hologram of his personality, suspected to be alien technology.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;interesting&#8221; the Lt. Said &#8220;set a course for new Berlin&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is west point to all near by Liberty law enforcement ships. Patrol 666, knows as devil patrol has gone down in the bad lands, I repeat all liberty law enforcement ships patrol 666 has gone down in the bad lands&#8221; The announcer at west point said urgently
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is patrol zeta 1 checking in, my men will be there with gusto&#8221; 
<br />&#8220;Patrol Gamma 1 , my men are enroute.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Patrol Alpha 1, roger were there.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;So&#8221; a outcast said over the COM  &#8220;were do you think this hole goes?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220; I dunno man&#8221; another outcast said &#8220;but we better go, back up for the liberty agent will be coming soon!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Right&#8221; the first outcast said &#8220;To all ships through the jump hole&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is admiral Vern to all Hunter ships, the war bird Fainer has spotted about 20 light fighter coming through the hole, we have opened fire upon them.&#8221; The admiral said &#8220;the push is now I repeat, report to your stations in 8 hours and suite up. Were going in!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Herrian ran franticly  down the halls of the &#8216;new dawn&#8217; lights were blaring and the alarm was sounding. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Red alert Read alert, preparing to enter combat zone, all hands to battle stations.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Herrian burst onto the bridge gasping.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Captain on deck!!!!&#8221; the second in command yelled.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Okay men&#8221; Herrian said loudly &#8220;through the hole and into hell&#8221;</div>
