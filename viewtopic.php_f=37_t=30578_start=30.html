			<div class="content">DRKmatter, 
<br /> 
<br />The tone of your post both offends me and lacks facts. 
<br /> 
<br />1. We have received NOT ONE bug report from you even though you say you have reported them, we asked in our readme to send bug reports to any of three email addresses, either you did not read the readme or chose to ignore the contact details
<br />2. You have not posted 4 times as you state only once. I went back through all the posts on this thread and 4 pages back on the mod thread and can only find one post by you.
<br />3.  You are running a side bs mod (not compatible), when we specifically asked not to run any other mods or side mods in conjunction. also ignored.
<br />4. Once we had made the first patch I went to your server site, I signed in under my own name, sat in Manhattan and tried to contact the console...I was ignored. 
<br />5. You did not ask permission to put the mod on your server not even the courtesy of an email
<br />6. Bugs reported ? what bugs reported.. we have not received one bug report from you. If they are bugs and we dont know about them.. how do we take action.. to help you out?
<br />7. Dont do us any favours, we will ask you to remove our material from your server should you put it back up.
<br />8. We dont want you to run our mod as you have a not reported any faults and we specifically state that you are not to run our mod a) without permission and b) with other side mods
<br /> 
<br />On the other hand both Bobways and (Cyborg) have been both accurate and specific with their crash reports and have been invaluable with their help and assistance in helping us locate exact areas where the mod has crashed. enabling us to:
<br /> 
<br />a) Find specific areas of fault thus enabling us to search the offending files for the errors.. and in all areas we have found the faults quickly.
<br />b) Update files faster and get them to the mod operators first so they can take action and minimise problems.
<br />c) Go online with one of the players and/or the Sys Ops, fly to the area and check the results ourselves.
<br /> 
<br />Funnily enough the players there dont seem to just sit around Manhattan in battleships waiting for something to happen.. they get out and experience the mod.
<br /> 
<br />I would welcome your response and just to make sure you see this I will also email this to your email address as listed in your post. 
<br /> 
<br />Harrier

			<div class="content">Wow guys all this because I dident email u If u look in this forum I have 6 posts 5 under this handle &amp; 1 as darkmatter I have absoulty no prob not running your mod 
<br />why u r so pissed I dont know as far as harrior loging on 2 the server and nobody responding I am sorry the mod was on the test box and has no active admin montering it and I have a busness 2 run and am ot arround execpt early in am like now (6:10 am westcoast) or after 7 pm I download and test run all mods that I think would enhanse our line up we have a lot of steady players on our servers and had 34 player accounts in 2 days 
<br />I was thinking that your mod would b a great clan type mod were clans could est bases in the new systems  but as I said befor the mod has nothing 2 do there r no missions in the new systems no commodies I spent a lot of time travling arround checking things out 
<br />I posted a list of bugs on this forum u said to see above post 
<br />I asked u about a prob I of my players was having and got several responses I said the server crashed 4 no reason and got a response 
<br />it just blowes my mind how the modding comninuity goes off the deepend when somebody comments on there work esp if its critical or sugestive in content .
<br /> I have played on cyborgs server he was also running the Manhatten missions mod and his server crashed 4 times during the time I was there
<br />I do not play on bobways servers ( mutch ) though he has a small loyal following that play there all the time so u should get all the feedback u need 
<br /> I have played on 1 other server running your mod allong with 1 other person as there was nobody else on server 
<br />the others were PW locked or the ping was over 300 4 me 
<br />cyborg has 1 server bobway has 2 at last count we have 5 and can add more easly 
<br />all on highspeed connections with 3 t1 dsl lines at our disposal 
<br />we also have well over 4000 player accounts hell we were still getting 45 hits a day  on the rebalance server were I was planning 2 put your mod 
<br />I am sorry that we cant worktogether and if I offended u or your team that was not my intention  nor did I flame u or yours ,hope u have sucess with your mod
<br />
<br />
<br />Have A Great Day</div>

<br /> As I said earlyer your mod was running on our test box and was not actively being watched  If I had known that he was there I would have loved 2 talk 2 him/you
<br /> I did not change your code I added the server side missions mods that is all and I told u that I did it
<br /> on page ! of this forum I have 4 posts all relating 2 bugs I found and a prob I was having with a player  who couldent by any ships I even told u what I had don so far 2 fix the prob parabolix responded 2 the post
<br /> I havent spamed this forum or any other 
<br /> I have been thinking about this misunderstanding  4 most of my workday and can only hope that we can work our way through this, if not so b it
<br /> I am the mod tester 4 oregon/usa servers I down load and test every mod that comes out I run Data Storm first then load up the mod on the test box then I play the mod if I like the mod I go and get our server admins and several other players that r always arround and everybody spends a few hrs playing the mod at this point the qualites of the mod r discussed if its positive I then let it run 4 a few days and see how mutch traffic it generates your mod had 34 player accounts that cleared the auto maintenance (rebalance had 174 in the same time frame) and maxed out at 832 .
<br />I personally own 3 of the oregon/usa server boxes and have invested thousands of my dollars into then as they all have p4 2.6 HT with a gig of ddr333 or better on p4p800 motherboards these boxes were custome built by darkmatter the owner of the diskspace and the guy u mistakenly flamed on your posts
<br />the reason I dident email you was because I have 2 kids a wife /mortgage &amp; rapidly growing business that takes up most of my time
<br />
<br />
<br />Have A Great Day</div>

			<div class="content">DRKmatter/DrKrEaper,
<br />
<br />I was unaware of your dual personality, and I must admit that I got a bit hot under the collar. If I offended you I apologise. The team has spent almost 11 months on this making a whole host of new original models and have been trying to make this mod as good as possible.. and while I agree it has had some faults, we have been working hard to fix faults that cause the game to crash. No matter how much you test on a closed server .. and I spent almost 100 hours in there with the other team members..testing, fixing, testing etc., we still missed stuff. We have been available for operators to contact us, to try to rectify all the problems etc as quickly as we can. What more can we do? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />OK there are no missions in the new systems but there are commodities, maybe not many but they are there and will be added to. There is a scarcity of ships in the new systems as well.. We intend to place both Freelancer  ships and some Epsilon ships in there, while still maintaining a balance as much as is possible. New factions also exist in the new systems, plus some 'native' factions have been ubered up considerably. (Try taking a run from Honshu to Akuma if the Blood Dragons dont like you.) <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> It is also possible that the mod could be used as a&quot;Clan&quot; type mod as well. missions are also to be added to the new systems as well as some planetscapes for some of the bases on planets. At least 3 more factions are now working and will be added to 2.7.. The Nazo, Hussars and the Exiles... Soon there will be no places to hide....
<br />
<br />As to the problem with the freighter pilot, from your previous post I gather that it is an isolated problem that does not effect any other players.. if so to my mind the problem would appear to be his end.. is he trying to run another mod at the same time...? does he have remnants of other mods in Freelancer files? Does he need to unistall/reinstall Freelancer then run sdk before activating the mod? The docking problems I dont know about but I have since docked at all three without any hitches in my server.. does the problem still exist?  A high ping rate I am well used to since I live in Australia and can live with it, if i get anything under about 300 I am very happy and often play at higher ping than that. I would be happy to invite both of you to my locked server (no Ioncross files) and we can try to replicate the problem there. The reason I run no Ioncross server files is I want the mod to be as clean as I can get it. I can however provide enough credits to get you well started. 
<br />
<br />I am sure we can work through this and I am happy to try... I appreciate that the numbers may have been down in comparison to established mods this is our first release and we have never wavered in our intention to make a mod that was different to most others... some ppl just dont like being blasted to cinders by Rogues in level 8/9 Shrikes the first time they leave Manhattan... (Though it can come as a bit of a surprise lol <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) I too have been thinking about this most of the day and would like to apologise to darkmatter for flaming him..
<br />
<br />So how do we start to patch things up... I would like to if we can. 
<br />
<br />Harrier.
<br />
<br />P.S. I have just seen your email so I will respond personally to that

			<h3><a href="#p291541" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Recently I downloaded your Epsilon Mod 2.9.6 and the patches.
<br />I have not seen much of it yet because as a singleplayer I first tried to play the storyline. Yes I know, that is not what the mod was intended for. Nevertheless I want to share with you my findings. I simply eliminated the OPENSP mod part. Up till mission 8 (with Ozu going after Tekagi&#8217;s transport) it went ok. I abandoned the storyline there because I had to give Ozu another ship to make him follow me. Maybe I&#8217;ll check out later how to continue.
<br />
<br />So now to the serious business. Restarted with the OpenSP part included. I have seen only 3 systems yet, but 38th Parallel scenery is awesome. Flying around there I made some observations. The following are suggestions and certainly not critism but an attempt to help you to enhance the mod.
<br />1.	Jumpholes
<br />In space, when targetted, the jumpholes are labelled xxxx System, sector yZ. This is valid for all jumpholes in all systems. It made me curious what was causing this. I found that restoring the original jumphole entries in the Solararch.ini solved the problem. But you are probably aware of that and there is are reasons why these changes were made, but, so far I failed to see them. In my opinion and I tested that, the jumpholes need not be converted to Jumpgates to achieve the desired jumpeffect.
<br />An restored example in Solararch.ini:
<br />[Solar
<br />nickname = jumphole_green
<br />ids_name = 60211
<br />ids_info = 66146
<br />type = JUMP_HOLE
<br />;type = JUMP_GATE
<br />DA_archetype = solar\dockable\jump_hole.3db
<br />material_library = solar\Solar_mat_misc02.mat
<br />;material_library = fx\envmapbasic.mat
<br />;envmap_material = envmapbasic
<br />;LODranges = 0, 8000, 12000, 18000, 22000, 50000
<br />mass = 10000.000000
<br />loadout = jumphole_green
<br />jump_out_hp = Hporient
<br />solar_radius = 600
<br />shape_name = NAV_jumphole
<br />docking_sphere = jump, HpDockMountA, 150
<br />hit_pts = 999999961690316250000000000000000000.000000
<br />phantom_physics = true
<br />2.	NAV_map HI03, 38th Parallel System.
<br />On the nav map the Tenshi dust cloud is visualized as being a scrap debris field and secondly it is displayed to be mineable, but is declared as a nonmineable asteroid field. Since you use roid_rock_tri asteroid type to create the asteroid field my suggestion would be that you use property_flag = 66 in stead off  130. To get rid of the mineable indication: change visit = 36 into 32. There&#8217;s only one catch here. If you have already been near the field, and you have been when you visited the system, you won&#8217;t notice the difference because in the savegame the area stays declared as mineable.
<br />For those you can edit savegame fl files: look for visit = 3155450887, 45. Change 45 into 41.
<br />This is my suggestion for the Tenshi dust cloud:
<br />[Zone
<br />nickname = Zone_Hi03_newfield_01
<br />Comment = Tenshi Dustcloud
<br />ids_name = 460415
<br />ids_info = 460415
<br />pos = 2019, 0, -3534
<br />rotate = 0, 14, 0
<br />shape = ELLIPSOID
<br />size = 54532, 55037, 55037
<br />property_flags = 66
<br />visit = 32
<br />spacedust = dust
<br />spacedust_maxparticles = 50
<br />sort = 20
<br />toughness = 6
<br />density = 5
<br />repop_time = 20
<br />max_battle_size = 4
<br />pop_type = nonlootable_ast_field
<br />relief_time = 35
<br />3.	Landing on BS Washington.
<br />When landing on Washington you arrive on a deck with only two icons on top of the screen: deck and the bar. This is because in the base\hi03_06_base.ini the start location is declared to be on deck2. In deck2 only 2 rooms are declared. Since deck2 scenery is the same as deck, I suggest to change the line in base\hi03_06_base.ini start_room = from deck2 into deck.
<br />[BaseInfo
<br />nickname = Hi03_06_Base
<br />start_room = Deck
<br />4.	HI03_dyson_city_01 &#8211; New Found City
<br />Clearly this is a nomad environment. Yet the City and the comsat show neutral. Suggest adding nomad reputation. 
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = HI03_dyson_city_01
<br />ids_name = 460429
<br />ids_info = 460429
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />pos = -1459, 0, -1026
<br />archetype = dyson_city
<br />reputation = fc_n_grp
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = HI03_com_sat_01
<br />ids_name = 460425
<br />ids_info = 460425
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />pos = -829, 0, -3689
<br />archetype = com_sat
<br />reputation = fc_n_grp
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = HI03_dyson_city_platform_01
<br />ids_name = 460425
<br />ids_info = 460425
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />pos = 1288, 0, -3286
<br />archetype = dyson_city_platform
<br />reputation = fc_n_grp
<br />5.	Nomad Weapon platforms
<br />	2 of the 3 nomad weapon platform can be destroyed, the 3th is within dyson shield. Is this intentional?
<br />6.	Hi03_sun1
<br />	Unlike other suns in the Freelancer universe, the sun death aera here exceeds the sun atmosfere. Which means that there is no burn area but instant death.In the systems I have checked the sun death area is smaller than the sun atmosfere area (mostly 1000). Since burncolor is declared, I guess this was unintended. I suggest adjusting atmosfere and sun death size.
<br />	To allow players closer to the New Found City and the spawning of Nomads more frequently/likely it is best to move the sun just a little bit further from the city, just far enough without spoiling the scenery.
<br />This are my suggestions for the Hi03_Sun1:
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = HI03_Sun1
<br />ids_name = 460393
<br />ids_info = 460393
<br />pos = 169, 0, 2000
<br />ambient_color = 255, 255, 255
<br />archetype = sun_2000
<br />star = red_giant_sun
<br />atmosphere_range = 5000
<br />burn_color = 255, 255, 255
<br />[zone
<br />nickname = HI03_Sun1_death
<br />pos = 169, 0, 2000
<br />shape = SPHERE
<br />size = 4000
<br />damage = 100000
<br />sort = 99.500000
<br />density = 0
<br />relief_time = 0
<br />6.	HI03_jumpgate_nodock_01 and _nodock_02
<br />The locked jumpgates in the 38th Parallel system are not shown on the navmap. To correct this the line visit = 0 has to be added to both entries in the HI03.ini file. To get a proper name label it is also necessary to change the jumpgate_nodock entry in the Solararch.ini. Here the type has to be changed from SATELLITE into JUMP_Gate.
<br />Both are also lacking a reputation. Since no_dock01 leads to the Europa system where the local faction is the Rheinland navy the gate is suggestyed to have reputation = rh_n_grp. Since no_dock02 leads to the Zone21 system where the local faction is the Liberty navy the gate is suggested to have reputation = li_n_grp.
<br />Suggested modifications in Solararch.ini:
<br />[Solar
<br />nickname = jumpgate_nodock
<br />ids_name = 60209
<br />ids_info = 66145
<br />type = JUMP_GATE
<br />DA_archetype = solar\dockable\jump_gateL.cmp
<br />material_library = solar\Solar_mat_ring.mat
<br />material_library = fx\envmapbasic.mat
<br />envmap_material = envmapbasic
<br />LODranges = 0, 8000, 12000, 18000, 22000, 50000
<br />mass = 10000.000000
<br />loadout = jumpgate
<br />solar_radius = 600
<br />shape_name = NAV_jumpgate
<br />Suggested modifications in Hi03.ini:
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = HI03_jumpgate_nodock_01
<br />ids_name = 460420
<br />ids_info = 460420
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />pos = -26800, 0, -31550
<br />visit = 0
<br />archetype = jumpgate_nodock
<br />reputation = rh_n_grp
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = HI03_jumpgate_nodock_02
<br />ids_name = 460412
<br />ids_info = 460412
<br />rotate = 0, 0, 0
<br />pos = 22899, 0, -31211
<br />visit = 0
<br />archetype = jumpgate_nodock
<br />reputation = li_n_grp
<br />7.	In Ew08 &#8211; Mace, the jumpgate Ew08_to_Hi03 is wrongly labelled 38th Parallel Jumphole. I suggest to change the ids_name into 460427 (38th Parallel Jumpgate).
<br />[Object
<br />nickname = EW08_to_HI03
<br />ids_name = 460427
<br />pos = -12250, 0, -34500
<br />rotate = 0, 160, 0
<br />archetype = nomad_gate
<br />msg_id_prefix = gcs_refer_system_HI03
<br />jump_effect = jump_effect_bretonia
<br />ids_info = 66145
<br />reputation = f_l_grp
<br />behavior = NOTHING
<br />difficulty_level = 7
<br />loadout = jumpgate_br_02
<br />pilot = pilot_solar_easiest
<br />goto = HI03, HI03_to_EW08, f_nomad_jump
<br />8.	All the new Epsilon systems have a visit = 128 entry in the Universe.ini file. This prohibits that the systems become visible on the Navmap. What is the idea behind this?
<br />9.	As &#8220;creator&#8221; of the unofficial FL SP patch I could not help noticing the fact that some errors the patch corrects are still present in your files. If you would like me to point them out for you, just let me know.
<br />
<br />Finally, if the above suggestions were helpful and you would like to receive suggestions like these in the future, let me know.

<br />Wow!, This is really good stuff, it is something else to see that someone has taken the trouble, of looking for and errors omissions in the files and then offering extremely helpful structured information, instead of throwing brickbats at us. My thanks.
<br /> 
<br />It will take some time to look at and digest, (for me at least), then discussion (natch.. lol) but the suggestions you have made will be done ,  though there is one area that will stay pretty much the same as it is now, maybe with some &quot;refinements&quot;, and that's the area around New Found Nehan City.. we have something &quot;nasty' in the works for that area. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Many thanks for the suggestions, we would be very  happy if you were interested at looking at other areas and offering help and suggestions.  I have responded to your post with an email similar to what I have placed here. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Also, I uploaded a complete Epsilon 2.6.9.2, that incorporates all the patches.. and have passed the mod to several of the server operators... If you are going to play on line please get the latest version, REMOVE/DELETE the old version and patch then activate the mod in the normal way. The mod is available and can be downloaded <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=1065' Target=_Blank> Here </a><img src='http://www.lancersreactor.com/images/news/bp95.gif   '> 
<br />
<br />plus 2.7 beta is getting closer..... I expect to have a working version availble in the next couple of days.. all going well. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I've noticed you can get faster thrust, to the point where your thrust w/ or w/ out engine kill is faster than the cruise speed. what then is the point of cruise? how about setting the cruise higher or adding something for a player to aquire that will up the cruise speed? it just makes sense that cruise SHOULD be faster than you can thrust.  OR work it so the speed mod works w/ this mod. 
<br />yes I play just single player. 
<br />just raising a point

			<div class="content">Thanks for the point, but you may notice that thrusters dont last forever. Also they are alot hard to find. This isnt ment to be a speed mod, but going around slowly on new (and larger) systems gets very annoying. One of the major points of the Epsilon Mod was to make better ships, weapons, thruster, and shield.
<br />Making battles against Ai AND players alot hard. 
<br />
<br />Adding thrusters is another feature and extention of this.
<br />Also you CAN have a speed mod on if you wish.
