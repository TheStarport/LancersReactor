			<div class="content">All right kids, settle down. I have chapter 4 all ready to go.
<br />
<br />Be warned: there is a cameo appearance by an original FL character.
<br />
<br />Chapter 4
<br />
<br />	Deckard slowly awoke to find himself in a dark smelly storage room with his hands bound behind his back. He groaned as he felt the back of his head throbbing. He sat up andlooked around trying to find the case, but whoever had jumped him had taken it. What did you expect, you idiot? he thought to himself.
<br />
<br />	He looked up as a door opened and a figure entered, carrying the case. The figure shut the door behind him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well well, look who's awake,&quot; the figure said. In the dim light he could see the man holding the case in one hand, and pulling a blaster pistol out of its holster with the other.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Now that you're up, why don't you tell me what's in here?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Why don't you get bent?&quot; Deckard replied.
<br />
<br />	The man slammed the pistol into the side of Deckard's head, knocking him to the ground. He sat up slowly and felt the warm blood trickle down the side of his face.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Don't smartmouth me again,&quot; the man said icily. &quot;I'll ask you again: What's in the case?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know,&quot; Deckard replied. &quot;I'm just a courier.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well then, it looks like whoever it belongs to isn't going to get it, because you won't be around to deliver it.&quot; In the dim light Deckard could see a cold smile spread across the man's face as he raised his weapon.
<br />
<br />	Deckard heard a loud thud behind the man as the door was kicked open. Another figure sood there, weapon drawn as the man spun around. The figure in the door fired a single shot into the man's chest. He dropped to the floor without a sound.
<br />
<br />	The figure moved onto the room, and Deckard recognized her as the LSF agent from the bar.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked as she untied him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah, I'm fine.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Come on,&quot; she said, helping him to his feet, I'm taking you to Medical.&quot;
<br />
<br /> 	--------------------
<br />
<br />	Half an hour later, Deckard was feeling much better. The medic on duty had patched up his wounds and had given him something for the pain. He walked out of the infirmary to find the LSF agent waiting for him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Feeling better?&quot; she asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah,&quot; he replied. &quot;Thanks for helping me out back there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Just doing my job. My name's Jun'ko Zane, by the way.&quot; She offered her hand.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Jun'ko Zane? <i>The </i> Jun'ko Zane?&quot; he asked as they shook hands.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You've heard of me?&quot; she asked, surprised.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah, you had a bounty on your head last year. I tried to collect on it, until they pardoned you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh, that,&quot; she smiled weakly. &quot;Sorry to disappoint you. So, what's in the case?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know. I'm transporting it for someone.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;May I ask who?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Maybe,&quot; Deckard said, &quot;if you buy me a drink. Name's Deckard, by the way.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How about you just tell me,&quot; Zane asked impatiently, &quot;and then I'll decide if I want to buy you a drink.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm LSF, Mr. Deckard, it's my job to find out stuff.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Why does the LSF concern itself with a simple mugging by a dumbass Liberty Rogue?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Because the guy who jumped you wasn't a Rogue. He was an Outcast.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Liberty Rogues don't make it a point to follow a guy around with a case. Whoever jumped you knew you had something important. I overheard him asking around the bar if people had seen you. I followed him when I saw him carrying your case. This is more than just a simple mugging, Mr. Deckard. Now are you going to tell me who hired you to transport this case or not?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard hesitated. &quot;All right, his name's Maddox. He didn't give me any other information.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Did this guy have a big scar down the side of his face? Short white hair? Built like a tank?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yeah...you know him?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes I do. I'm surprised you don't.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Why? Should I?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Come on, I'll buy you your drink.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The bar, fortunately, was not very busy. Zane led Deckard to an out-of-the-way booth.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Any reason you picked the most remote booth in the Colonies?&quot; Deckard asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Security,&quot; Zane replied. &quot;What are you drinking?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Rheinland Lager.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Okay. Be right back.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard watched as she strode up to the bar to get the drinks. She was rather attractive, he thought to himself. Too bad she's LSF, otherwise we could've had something.
<br />
<br />	He thought back to what she had said about who attacked him. Outcasts? What was an Outcast doing clear out here? And why would they want to take what was in the case? Wasn't he delivering it to them anyway? None of it made any sense.
<br />
<br />	Jun'ko Zane returned with two of the fine Lagers.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You know, this isn't too bad. Beats the pants off of Liberty Ale.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Bottled water beats the pants off of Liberty Ale,&quot; Deckard replied. &quot;So, who's this Maddox guy?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Samuel Maddox was one of the Liberty Navy's finest. He was a highly decorated officer, probably the most decorated Naval officer in Liberty history. He retired his commission a couple of years ago and is now one of President Jacobi's advisors. His opininons count for a lot in Liberty. If he suggests something to Jacobi, Jacobi usually does it.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So what's the big deal about him hiring me?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's a bit unusual that someone of his stature would hire a freelancer off a job board to deliver a package, don't you think? He has other channels available to him. By the way, where are you delivering this to?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard thought for a moment. Should he tell her, after being jumped by an Outcast? Things could get very bizarre indeed...
<br />
<br />	&quot;Look, Ms. Zane. Thank you for saving me back there, but my jobs are really not any of your business. The only thing I care about is dropping this thing off, collecting my pay and replacing that pile of crap in the docking bay. So if you'll excuse me, I'm on a tight schedule here. Good day.&quot; With that, Deckard stood up and walked out of the bar. He could feel Jun'ko Zane's eyes burning into him as he entered the lift and pressed the button for the docking bay. He hoped to high heaven his ship was repaired.

			<div class="content">All right everyone, keep your pants on. Here is chapter 5.
<br />
<br />Chapter 5
<br />
<br />	It's just like I remember it, Deckard thought to himself as he pulled his jacket tighter around him and scanned the cold gray skies of Hamburg.
<br />
<br />	He had never liked coming here, because of the crappy climate, but the drinks were good and there were good-paying jobs to be had. Besides, he had a new ship to buy. Deckard's original plan was to stop at the battleship Westfalen and pick up a Valkyrie, but he had remembered that Hamburg had a similarly configured ship for sale called the Falcon. He had heard a little about it and had flown against a few, but didn't really know anything else about it.
<br />
<br />	He entered the ship dealer's office and inquired about the Falcon. The dealer led him over to a ship shaped like a bird-of-prey and handed Deckard an infocard. Deckard fell instantly in love with the Falcon and plopped down his credit stick, all thoughts of the Valkyrie forgotten.
<br />
<br />	Half an hour later he was back in space, putting his new fighter through a few maneuvers and loving every minute of it. The Falcon was certainly better that that P.O.S. Barracuda he had been forced to fly. In fact, he thought, this may be one of the finest ships I've ever flown. Why didn't I fly this before?
<br />
<br />	Deckard was so busy enjoying his new ship that it took him a moment to realize he had acquired a wingman.
<br />
<br />	Two wingmen.
<br />
<br />	The ships had taken up a position in front of him, one on the right and one on the left. Where had they come from? It was almost as if they had appeared out of nowhere. Deckard involuntarily tightened his grip on the flight yoke, ready for anything. What came next surprised him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Mr. Deckard, it is vitally important that we speak with you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard keyed his comm system. &quot;Why? Are you just generally sociable people?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;This is a serious matter, Mr. Deckard. If we wanted to discuss smart-ass remarks we'd be at a comedy club on Manhattan. Trust me, we'd rather be there than here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;So what's so important?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We want you to follow us to a little known base in the Frankfurt, called Bruchsal. We will answer all of your questions there. There is a jump hole to Frankfurt not far from here. We will escort you there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trust me, it would be a lot better if you came with us. You are in more danger than you know. Need I remind you of Freeport 2?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How the hell did you know about that?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;As I said, we will try to answer your questions and give you more information if you follow us. Believe me when I tell you that there are people who will never stop hunting you while you carry that case. As for us, we have no intention of harming you. In fact, you may find our assistance and protection beneficial. Please, we would not be making such an effort if it was not of such great importance.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Deckard thought it over. He was just now realizing how foolish he had been to accept a courier mission that payed so much. He was really in over his head now, and he was paying the price for his foolishness. He decided he had no other choice.
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right. Lead on.&quot;
<br />
<br />	----------
<br />
<br />	The three ships emerged from the jump hole inside a dark nebula. What made it worse was that it looked like they had jumped right into the middle of a minefield.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Follow us and be careful,&quot; one of Deckard's escort said. &quot;These are high-yield mines.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The ships picked their way carefully through the field and emerged into open space some minutes later. After a short trip, they approached a large asteroid.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Here we are,&quot; the escort said. &quot;Go ahead and land. We will meet you in the bar.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Whatever, Deckard thought. He set his ship down in the docking bay, and several minutes later was in the bar.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ahh, Mr. Deckard. Nice to finally meet you in person.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The individual addressing him was dressed in a plain flightsuit bearing no insignia. Her companion was dressed the same. Clearly these were people who did not want to be identified. Criminals, maybe?
<br />
<br />	&quot;My name is Rianna Blair,&quot; she continued as they shook hands,&quot; and this is Jason Nelson. Shall we have a seat?&quot; She motioned to an empty booth, and they all sat.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So are you going to tell me who you are and what you want?&quot; Deckard asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We can start there, if you want. Mr. Nelson and I represent the Order, and we want that case you're carrying.&quot;
<br />
<br />
