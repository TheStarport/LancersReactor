			<div class="content">They are called Cruise disruptors, you should look into how they work and how they are used because they are a very effective tool to stop lamers running away from you.
<br />
<br />yes i was in a drake, but no one is forcing you to fly the dagger so why should i fight with my hands tied behind my back? I would have attacked you regardless if you were in an eagle/sabre/titan AND i wouldn't have pulled the classic raider quote &quot;Get a dagger, then i will fight you&quot;.
<br />
<br />The bottom line is that you're clan is this huge n00b magnet who have little to no idea on how the game works AND still you choose to piss off ALOT of people.
<br />
<br />just a very, and i stress very small list of people you have pissed off
<br />
<br />-NoTec
<br />-NEO
<br />-WP
<br />
<br />3 of the biggest clans on elite, not a very smart move in my book.
<br />
<br />anyways I dont want to interfere with you're random acts of lameness and stupidity.
<br />
<br />One last thing that came to mind.
<br />
<br />It has been established on several diffrent threads that blowing up frieghters without taxing them was just lame. However just the other day when I alone was beating you guys around in bruchsal crafty and you both admited to blowing up notec freighters. 
<br />
<br />You're going to say, &quot;But they were notec frieghters&quot;
<br />
<br />But at the time you didnt know they were notecs so you therefore thought it was just a random person, and i am almost certain that you blow up independant traders pissing off the general community as well.

			<div class="content">Carl you are such a sh!thead, but i spose thats to be expected.  
<br />
<br />We kill notec and neo traders.  We have a list of them.  Call it lame if you want.. we don't care.  We will continue to hunt notec and neo traders.  Your sad attempt to discredit the Raiders would be more effective if you weren't known scum.  
<br />
<br />As far as pissing off the Scum of elite goes.. we hardly care.  Everyone except for those 3 power-tripping wanna-be scum clans and their psycophants likes and supports the Raiders.  The fact that your rabble don't like us really makes me want to cry, but I will refrain.  
<br />
<br />n00bs?  Sure we have some n00bs.  It is something we are all guilty of at one time or another.  Your point?  Oh.. you don't have one...  
<br />
<br />nice try though.</div>

			<div class="content">Well, the problem seems to be that people equate killing with a lack of morals.  Thats actually pretty silly in a game.  Perhaps it would be best if we redefined killing as:
<br />'Forcibly respawned without cargo'
<br />
<br />It's not such a big deal at all when it comes down to it.  If the AI kills us we put it down to the challenge level of the game.  But if a player 'kills' us we act like they just slipped a dagger into our sister.  Come on people; lose the double standard.  There are no missions to challenge you in multi-player; you can expect the players to create a little challenge of their own.  If you can't hack the competition then join or create a server where the rules state that combat only occurs in formal duels.  I imagine a great deal of unskilled pilots will flock to the server, so it might even be easier to win a few.
<br />
<br />@cowboysach:  Don't assume.  It makes a fool out of you.  You will notice that all of the anti-neo posts have been made by roughly 8 players over and over again.  Out of the hundreds that play on elite that really is a pretty good ratio.   You've never met a NEO and yet you are willing to believe the word of ~8 players who would rather fight on a forum than in the game?  My, but you are gullible.  I bet you buy products that claim on the commercials 'more people prefer the product' without ever wondering if that phrase simply meant 'More than last year' or something like that.  
<br />
<br />Myself, I rarely play on Elite, but I have encountered enough NEO to know that while they talk the talk, they also walk the walk, and that is worthy of some respect in my book.  Most of the other players I have seen post anti-Neo comments are generally a little noobish when you meet them in the game.  Probably they're angry because they thought they were good at the game from single-player, but became angry when someone in multi-player showed them that human opponents are more difficult than AI.  We used to get that sort back in the 'Quake days' on a regular basis.  
<br />
<br />The exception is cams, who is definately experienced, but has often let 'slip' in the forums that he uses any means possible to attack NEO (who kicked him from their clan).  Those means include propoganda campaigns.  Cams is smart enough to realize that his oration generally only works on the stupid and the gullible, but he also knows alot of people fit that criteria in the game of freelancer.  Even while you back his posts up, he is no doubt laughing at how foolish you were, and how easy to manipulate.  
<br />
<br />I once had a boss who said all the worlds mistakes could be attributed to ignorance and laziness.  In judging a server's players when you haven't even made the effort to go there, you have fallen prey to both.</div>

<br />
<br />I left NEO, this is a fact that even they cant deny, sure they can speculate i was going to be kicked out anyway etc, but thats speculation, the plain fact here was, i left. I post everytime to expose the real NEO, yes i was one of them, and the clan made me sick everyday, i think ppl here need to know what is really NEO, and thats why im here. I flame a lot here, sure not much for neo itself, but with the administration total biased position with the NEO clan, after all i got banned from elite a little after i left a clan where verbal abuses happened on a daily basis (i really dont care if they deny it, NEO has no word as experience will tell everyone of you), and the moment i leave the clan i get banned for verbal abuse, not for cheating/modding/hacking but for verbal abuse.
<br />
<br />Since your comment regarding me was inaucurate and unfortunate i would recomend you take your own advice
