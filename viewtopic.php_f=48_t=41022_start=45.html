			<div class="content">Well, I looked at this thread again and decided that it's time for me to post a little story for everyone.  If you read it, good for you, because it'll maybe help you with your dream of making a mod.  
<br />
<br />This is a story about my own personal experiances, and about how I personally went from a guy with a desire to make a mod but no modding skill to a person who now runs one of the top 25 most active servers and has a mod that has nearly 10000 combined downloads since March.  
<br />
<br />Well, I came to TLR several years ago, and I got into a few things.  First was that I was drawn to the Evolutions Mod, which I loved and introduced me to mods in general, and second I was drawn to the Freelancer Fan Fiction which I still enjoy today.  I played on various servers, wrote a few stories, played some RPG games, and generally made some good friends around the Freelancer community.  
<br />
<br />Something else.  I happened to stumble across this community, but soon thereafter I realized that I was in the right place.  Let's face it, this is one of the downright BEST communities for modding there is.  Everything you need to know can be found right here on TLR.  There are loads of mods already made that feature many, many new things.  There are lots of servers running with lots of players from all different backgrounds.
<br />
<br />#1: So, get to know the community.  Make some friends.  Have some fun.  
<br />
<br />My first crack at modding personally was last summer, when I made one dinky little system in Freelancer Explorer that only half-worked and had maybe two bases.  But, the important thing was that I found I really enjoyed doing it, and I thought, hey, I can maybe make a mod of my own.  But I didn't start by asking for help here, or anything like that.  First I took my experiances from all the mods, all the things I had done, and came up with a unique experiance that I thought would be cool.  I consulted friends, got them on board as testers and idea-bouncers, and then I went right to the Tutorials forum and read up until i felt I understood the basics of doing things like making weapons, commodities, and a few other things.  A lot of it I didn't understand, but I got the basics of most of it.
<br />
<br />#2: Learn the basics of modding.  
<br />
<br />The next thing I did was go take a look at a mod that I had remembered from the frontpage of the site.  It was called the XML Toolkit, and I remembered the description saying that it would help you get started on making a mod of your own.  
<br />
<br />Well, that sounded like exactly what I wanted, so I got that.  I read all the documentation, and looked at the code.  A lot of it I still didn't understand, but I  learned a few new things and decided that I knew enough to be able to start.  
<br />
<br />#3: Use the tools that are already there for you.
<br />
<br />So, I had a basic idea in mind and I started using FL Explorer to edit Sirius a bit.  But then I realized that I would need some new factions.  So, where did I go?  I went back to the Tutorial forum and found Moonhead's excellent tutorial on adding factions.  I used that and made two new factions to put in the universe.  Then I went back to FLE, renamed a few things, and inserted my factions into the univsere.  
<br />
<br />#4:  Tutorials are your FRIEND.
<br />
<br />Once my factions were in there and crashes were minimized, I decided, hey, this is pretty cool.  Then, I added it to the XML Toolkit.  I wanted to build my mod off of that because I liked the features and wanted to add some more things to my mod.  Then I started telling my friends about it.  All my friends from TLR, from servers I'd played at, I showed them all the demo and many of them liked it.  One of my friends had a server he would host it on.  So the mod &quot;demo&quot; was put on a server and a few people started to play it.  But I wasn't happy yet.  I wanted more, so on the next version I tried more stuff, and ran into major issues.  Issues that neither I nor my friends could figure out.  
<br />
<br />That was when I finally came here for help.  I read the sticky first, read the posts by Chips and Argh, and then made a new thread outlining the goals of the mod, the current features, and a link to a download of the demo.  
<br />
<br />I waited, with no reply.  I kept trying to figure out what was wrong, but I didn't know what.  Freelancer would just crash.  
<br />
<br />Finally, I got an email from a guy who had coding experiance who was willing to help me out some.  I told him about my crash, and he showed me the problem and fixed it.  Then he offered to add more things to my mod, things like new equipment, new commodities, and he even helped code a few new ships that I had gotten permission for.  Best of all, he taught me more about coding things and how to fix bugs I found.
<br />
<br />#5:  If you need help, listen to what Argh, Chips, and Aldebaren have said.  They DO know what they are talking about, and it might work for you.  Post your thread and your demo or working beta and see what happens.
<br />
<br />Soon he had to stop helping because of life issues, but I had learned enough to do more on my own.  With the testing help of my friends,  I worked hard, through all sorts of crashes and issues, but eventually I got to the point where I could release my mod to TLR.  This was SIX MONTHS after the start of the project.  
<br />
<br />I got my server running, and lo and behold, people came to play.  Two of the first to play were both skilled coders, and there were a few others I could teach.  It just grew from there, and got easier and easier.  
<br />
<br />#6:  Start a server to draw people in to your mod.  Advertise, set up a site and forums, and do all that to get it to work.  
<br />
<br />Now, working on my third release, surrounded by a team of competent admins and modders, running a popular server, I am seeing my dream come true.  I still don't know everything there is about modding, but I never needed to.   
<br />
<br />In conclusion, I want to say this.  It wasn't easy, it wasn't always fun, and it was a long road.  But now, I look back and know it was worth every hour I spent working by myself, and I know it was worth it.  I know that was the way I had to have it work.  
<br />
<br />If you want the rewards, you're going to have to work for them.  It's just like the real world, folks.  The vast, vast majority of people who play Freelancer don't have a clue how to mod, so it's about drawing those who do in to you, and to do that, you NEED to be able to do it yourself.  
<br />
<br />So, I offer you a challenge.  Sit down and think about your idea.  Read the tutorials, and think about if you are willing to do what it takes.  If you are, then start working on a demo.  If you aren't, then go find an existing mod to play.  But the one thing you CANNOT do is go into this not willing to do the work.  All you'll get is disappointment.  
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading, and I hope it helps someone.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<h3><a href="#p420119" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Me and a friedn decided to make a mod for fun, it involved new ship classes (soldier, sniper, scout, defender, comander and heavy gunner) and as i learnt more about modding i got better and better at it. I made new systemsin my spare time (most turned out excelent!)
<br />
<br />heres a pic of a bit of my fave system ^^
<br /><img src='http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/7241/78085980tl0.png '>
<br />
<br />
<br />but then i got a clearer idea as to how much freelancer can be modded. so now i want to get togetehr a team to make a total conversion mod for freelancer (yes, another one, im sure theres many :p)
<br />
<br />New planets with bigger size useing the 'pretty planets' by argh. planets which are all up to scale and no longer take a few mins to fly around (not even) bigger ships which you can fly, bigger bases, new guns etc. i want to greatly add to the games 'eye candy'. change all the backgrounds to nicer ones, make planets and ships which are all of high quality (nice textures etc)
<br />
<br />freelancer is already a good game. it just lacks a few things like eye candy, which is what i plan on fixing. ive also seen on other servers, AI that can patrol with you etc. for this i will require someone who can code.
<br />
<br />i do NOT want alot of people for this project, and want all the work in it to be original and made by us etc, (with the exception of args planet thing, but thats the only way kno of to rescale planets)
<br />
<br />
<br />so right now, im looking for a coder who can edit AI etc and do stuff like i said above, i need someone who can model (preferably better then me ^_^; if not thats still ok, but im gana be wanting good models) someone to create us the textures, and someone for the systems.
<br />
<br />ive been moding FL for a while (probably no way near as longf as most of you guys) so i CAN do stuff like, implement models into the game (code them etc) make systems useing freelancer explorer (coz i luv that program) but also have a general knowledge as to how to do it manualy. i can model ships/bases. i can basiclay do a bit of everything. the thing im best at would have to be modeling tho. (and i cant say im all TOO good with that, but not crappy either)
<br />
<br />if you CAN help me please email me or contact me on MSN
<br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:Tidus97_fl@hotmail.com">Tidus97_fl@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->
<br />
<br />im also gana be emailing people to ask for help and stuff. this is obviously not everything im planing to do, but i dont want to post all that here (i cant be bothered reading othrs long posts, so i dont want mien to be that long)
<br />but we are thinking of things along the lines of clans being able to find uninhabited systems that we place in our game ourselves. once found that clan can buy that system, and have the jumphole used ot get to it changed to a jumpgate, and a tradelane from there to the nearest base. in there own system they can by tradelanes from us (say 5k of tradelane for 200k or somehting) and place there own bases etc. what they CANOT chang ehowever is what is already in the system (planets, suns, radation field, other jumpholes.) they can only inhabit planets which state it can be inhabited in the info card of that planet. they cant make jumpgate snaywhere they like, only change jumpholes to jumpgates.
<br />
<br />this idea needs a bit more thinking over, but im planing to do stuff like this for the mod.
<br />
<br />so in short,
<br />
<br />i need a coder, a modeler, a system maker/designer and a texture maker
<br />
<br />my msn <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Tidus97_fl@hotmail.com">Tidus97_fl@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->

<br />
<br />
<br />looking forward to wroking with some of you guys.

			<div class="content">Hey guys i am making a mod called the Hellfire freelancer expansion and would like some help here is an overview of my mod.
<br />
<br />Heres my Storyline
<br />
<br />It is 25 years after the Nomads New systems have been discovered and Sirius has flourished. The order have been recognized as a lawful faction and occupy their own lawful system. But in their Explorations Sirius found a new enemy. There are several other colonies in teir region of space. Kusari were Exploring the systems designated as delta systems and they were attacked without provocation and took heavy losses (Screenshots of kusari battleships being blown up will be included) and now war has broken out between Sirius and the Hellfire sector. It was given this designation due to its immediate hostility.
<br />
<br />However.... Only some new factions have remained hostile some have stayed neutral and Sirius is going to try to explore these new factions and see if they can find potential allies.
<br />
<br />Thats it so far also News in game will be altered to include new about new factions from Sirius point of view and also new news from the Hellfire sector point of View also in game it will be possible to find out the back story of each new colony.
<br />
<br />What i am planning to do is include RP events like the completion of the Chugoku gate and the Beginning construction of the tohoku gate. which will be done a few weeks after mod release in a monthly update. some RP events wont need updates like an increase in hostility and such.
<br />
<br />Here is an example still in work
<br />
<br />Chugoku Gate Complete
<br />Just a few weeks ago the Kusari naval forces announced that the jump gate to Chugoku has been completed and Kusari gunboats have begun deploying in the Chugoku system to make way for the construction of a base in that system. They have now begun construction of a Gate from Hokkaido to tohoku. and that will be complete in a couple of months. However there have been several blood dragon attacks on the Gate site so heavy battleships have been deployed in the Hokkaido system.
<br />
<br />Thats an example of what it will be like however i need a couple of model designers to help me with new base and ship models, a couple of info card creator and a couple more coders. 
<br />

			<div class="content">Theres a little thing I wanted to do for quite a while and I'm wondering if anyone is interested (heh..prolyl should have made a poll <img src=smilies/icon_smile_big.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />
<br />Anyway, I'd like to modify Freelancer, the SP specificly and re-balance everything, add changes:
<br />
<br />- all fighters have forward fixed guns
<br />- all factions have following ships classes: light, medium ,heavy fighters, assault fihgters and bombers
<br />- new capship classes such as carriers
<br />- capships with shields and changed weaponry
<br />- a few new systems
<br />- shields and weapons re-balanced and changed
<br />- all SP mission re-done and improved to accomodate changes
<br />
<br />I allready have a lot of models that could be quickly imported into FL and sufficient knowledge to do allmost everything..however it would take alot of time if I were to do it all alone.
<br />
<br />Here: Some pics of some ships
