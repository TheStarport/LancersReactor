			<div class="content">phroot, the cruise issue has been corected. that version it's already here, look in the main page. i also answered your post in the comments, as I said the afterburners cannot be used for too long, the more advanced and powerful the class the less time can be used. and about ship speeds, they are the same as v0.5d, if anybody think they're going too fast and can't control he ship, go buy a slower engine! the pirates have generaly slower ships, except the corsairs' leggionaires(128 m/s).</div>

			<h3><a href="#p140652" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Here's a list of all the versions and the features, changes and bugfixes that contain, so everyone can figure out what my mod is about&#058;
<br />Original version features: 
<br />   -allmost all Light Fighter ships have now a 5/1 weapons configuration. Their speed varies between 128 and 133 m/s. The Banshee is an exception having a 6/1 config, making it the best light fighter available, the patriot and cavalier have 4/1
<br />-the HF ships have a 7/1 weap config and speeds between 118 and 126 m/s. and the VHF ships have now 8/1 weapons config and speeds between 108 and 116 m/s.. The Kusari Blood Dragon know becomes a VHF, with 8/1 weapons and about 8400 armor. It is available at the Blood Dragons base.  . Some tweaks in the power output had been made in order to accommodate the increased number of guns on all fighters.
<br />-All other prices have been recalculated, now they are in relation with the class and capabilities of a ship, like maneuverability, firepower and max weapon class, not only armor as it was before... 
<br />-The missiles are now treated as cruise disruptors and are only mountable on that hardpoint, so they are not mixable with the guns anymore. I think that the producers of the game should have done that from the first place, as i remember in Starlancer that there was separates slots for missiles and guns were mounted in pairs. That's the config i prefer anyway. 
<br />-the npc shields on both enemy and allies now recharge to 1/2 of a normal shield. this is because i find them too easy to kill with their shields not recharging at all. watch for those high level Titans  though, they're much tougher now, with those lvl 7,8 and 9 shields. Some of the pirate fighters armor has been increased slightly, like Rogues, Junkers CSV&#8217;s and Corsais LF&#8217;s.
<br />-the cruise speed is set to 500 and cruise recharge varies from 3 for LF to 6 to freighters. So a LF can get away more quickly, and a VHF or a freighter will have problems with that...<img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. this is good also for mission 6 if one has a light fighter&#8230;
<br />-The ships are generaly easier to find and available at the most common sense locations...there is a Dagger in Magellan, a Barracuda, Banshee and Centurion in Bretonia, and Sabre, Hammerhead and Blood Dragon VHF in Kusari. 
<br />The weapons are also lowered in level requirements, only when they are needed most, like in New Berlin for example(The StealthBlade MKII). There is a Nomad Prototype is available in Toledo for the ones willing to try it... 
<br />The thrusters now act differently, but they add more speed with each class,at the price of more fuel consumption. I think enhancements to thruster must reflect in the propulsion force added balanced with the consumption. The Order Thruster brings your ship near to 330&#8230;
<br />I have fixed the turrets on both Falcon and Eagle and now they fire forward as well...i hope Eagle and Falcon fans will enjoy that...I did! 
<br />The laser weapons from Liberty, Rogues, Bounty Hunters and Blood Dragons have now and increased fire rate and better muzzle velocity, (the Justice, Wakizashi, Tanto, Gunslinger and Winchester are firing at 9.88/s to compensate for their low damage, while the Drail only at 9.22/s). I always thought that a laser weapon should fire faster than a photon cannon, which is bassicaly a chaingun. 
<br />The Blood Dragon fighter of both the pirates and the escorts from the missions with Ozu are now armed with 6 Wakizashis, and a Tanto turret. So they will be very hard to beat but also extremely useful allies in the missions to follow.  Check it out in the Kusari sistems!
<br />
<br />v 0.5b modifications and addons:
<br />  - the Defender VHF is now buyable at BS Yukon without crashing
<br />  - the class 3 missiles(Sweeper, Paralyzer and so on) are now mountable on cruise disrupter slot and not in the gun/missile ones.
<br />  - the freighters have been slightly changed, they are now more maneuvrable, have more energy and new guns, 
<br />   1 for the Rhino, 1gun/1turret for Clydesdale and 2guns/1 turret for the Dromedary. They are also able to mount cruise disruptors 
<br />   and have a higher level for shields and guns.
<br /> -some LF's that lacked the cruise disruptors due to a CMP modification have these mounted back...sorry for this bug. 
<br />-the Pirates guns and turrets do a little more damage than the original ones, so watch yourselfes especially against large 
<br />or high level party's, but  I think this will make killing them and geting those guns more of a challenge and satisfaction. 
<br />-there is more important equipment like better shields and weapon available at some bases, some visited in the plot but 
<br /> others U may have to search for...<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />-i have added a couple of guns for the TIE's, the Stealthblades mk1_m1 and mk1_m3, check them out in Calif. Minor, Mactan base and Battleship Hood, they have SW sounds as well.
<br />-the Positron shields have been tweaked to give more protection as u will need it in Bretonia....some loadouts problems with Barracuda, Hammerhead and Piranha
<br />are corected. 
<br />-the bug in mission 01b when the prison ship sometimes exploded before the player could get there is no more.
<br />
<br />version 0.5c changes and bug fixes:
<br /> -the Tie Defender it's buyable at BS Hood without crashing the game. 
<br /> -the infocards are now updated to reflect the actual ship config, armor and cargo bay/batteries/nanobots. 
<br /> -the maximum speed for that ship is also displayed in the ships infocard(only when F7 is pressed, not at the vendors...)
<br /> -the pirate fighter, Bloodhound and the elite version, Wolfhound now have more weapons and armor, but are slower. 
<br /> -fixed the weapon loadout for Patriot, Stilleto and Cavalier.
<br /> -the speeds for al ships have been recalculated and now match the infocard display, like 128-133 for the LF's, 118-126 for the HF's,
<br />108-112 for the VHF's and 96-102 for freighters.
<br /> -added the infocard and ship name for the BD VHF and the specs for this ship.
<br />
<br />v 0.5d changes and addons:
<br />-added the infocards ship name for TIE's also with specs for them.
<br />-added Incom X-wing Starfighter buyable at planet Manhattan, along with its own infocard(credits go for Cobalt for this one).
<br />
<br />v0.5e features:
<br />-finally some major changes: encounters heavily modified, and varied, Battleships, cruisers and gunboats added to random encounters.
<br />-added Batteships, Cruisers and Gunboats as patrols in Liberty, Bretonia and Kusari main systems(credits and thanx go for Nepilum for his excelent tutorial)
<br />-added the posibility to buy ships engines and display your own in equipment room, also I've added three general upgrades for engines with their infocard description.
<br />-added the posibility to buy ships powerplants and display your own, added three general upgrade powerplants for light, heavy and very heavy fighters, these work for freighters too.
<br />-scanners and advanced scanners are now buyable at the equipment shop, and so are the tractor beams.
<br />-when u scan a ship now u can see all it's real equips, type of engines, scanners, powerplants and tractor beams(if any).
<br />-u can now buy armor upgrades!!! 4 armor upgrades available, coded from 1 to 4, first adds 25% more armor, second 50%, third 75% and 4th 100%(doubles the armor of a ship)*,
<br /> they also have infocard name and characteristics built in. 
<br />*these are not displayed anywhere, but work, u can only see them at equipment dealer and with F7 in flight, internal equipment section!
<br />-the mod has support for the Slave1 Firespray Assault Fighter from Porsche, all u have to do is copy the slave1 directory from his BobbaFett_Slave1.flmod ziped file to the FL /data/ships directory. 
<br />It's configuration and behavior is altered to match a VHF. The armor, maneuvrability and cargo space have been lowered, check the infocard for details.
<br />The ship is buyable from Calif. Minor, BS Essex, BS Nagumo and Freeport 9. 
<br />
<br />v06b:
<br />-fixed the crashes on trade lane docking and planet leaving in New Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and other Rheinland, systems, also fixed crashes near  Yanagi depot in Sigma 13.
<br />-added Powerplant upgrade MKIV and Engine upgrade MkIV, these are very powerful and expensive pieces of hardware. 
<br />You can find them in the Border Worlds at the same places the Eagle and Titan are buyable, and on Planet Toledo/BS Osiris
<br />-make it possible to add missiles to a weapon slot, usually slot1, in adition to mounting them to cruise disruptor/torpedo slots.
<br />-added suport, infocard, new engine and engine sounds for the Dodonna/Blissex Awing. It's buyable on Calif minor, BS Hood and Freeport 9, 
<br />and it's coming in standard package with 2 Raphaels and 2 Slingshot Missile launchers. I recommend mounting a pulse or particle turret to round up the loadout.
<br />-please download the slave1/awing ship pack and copy the directories awing and slave1 form the archive to Freelancer\data\ships directory(this IS REQUIRED for the mod to work properly)
<br />-maked buyable the missing equipment like the Order VHF engine and powerplant. 
<br />-the power and armor upgrades now ocuppy more space in cargo hold, namely 5, 10, 15 and 20 for each superior class. so there is a price to pay other than the cash, for the top performance they offer.
<br />-colision damage doubled to make it more realistic.
<br />-cruise speed set to 500. (recommend u buy the Awing, Banshee or Tie Defender from BS Hood to win the race mission).
<br />-xwing has new engine color making it look more loke in the movies, also elite shield mount and balanced maneuvrability.
<br />-thrusters consume more fuel with each advanced version, very long thrusting it's no longer possible.
<br />-incorporated engine trail mod into mine for better visual effects.
<br />
<br />v06b3grrssk:
<br />-added Grssk 1.05 mod with the new system and jumpholes connection troughout the universe. also unlocked most of them from mission 2(that's why the name of the mod changed).
<br />and now a list of my addons:
<br />-added powerplants to looting&amp;random drops. also added special weapons at high levels to random drops
<br />-added escape pods to loot&amp;random drops, u can now sell the bad guys to the police!
<br />-included Cylon Heavy Fighter with a 4/2 weapon config, a new missile launcher and new infocard. It's buyable at pitssburg.
<br />-rhino freighter now buyable at BS Missouri.
<br />-reduced fuel consumption on high level thrusters, the heavy and advanced models. also slightly reduced on all others.
<br />-weapons effects on right shield are more visible(10% more) and shields offer more protection against a the right type of weapon(graviton against laser, pulse and photon weaps, 
<br />positron against neutron and tachyon weapons and molecular against plasma and particle weapons).
<br />-encounters with BS and Cruisers added within border and edge worlds, those are now piloted by pirates like corsairs, red hessians and outcasts!
<br />-HUGE battles between Outcasts, Corsairs and Red hessians flying fleets of combined BS's, Cruisers and Gunboats have been reported near planet Malta, Freeport 9, Ruiz Base, Leon base, Freeport 5, and Planet Crete!!!!
<br />-blood dragons also fly kusary gunboats, cruisers and destroyers.
<br />-thats a hidden key on awing and firespray that'll make u go at a a super speed(trade lane like)...just an easter egg.
<br />
<br />v06b4grrssk:
<br />-fixed crashes after mission 01b and mission 2, and the jump gate back to new york crash, by removing the aditional jumpholes in NW system...the others remained in place
<br />-added support for Slayn&amp;Korpil Bwing, with infocard, weapons loadout(8/2 gunsturrets) and engine sounds, please install it in the same way, as a Bwing directory in \data\ships. its buyable in Planet Crete, Ruiz base and Frankfurt.
<br />
<br />v06c:
<br />-added Starviper Colonial fighter with infocard, engine sound and a 4/1/2 weapon config
<br />-added Starfury (both ship are from Hostile Universe mod) with 6/0/1 weapons, infocard and engine.
<br />-both ships are buyable at Planet Los Angeles and Battleship Suffolk in New London
<br />-added heavy tractor beam with better range(2500 m) and scanner MKIII with 7000 scan range/3500 cargo scan range. Included them to random drops as well.

			<div class="content">I got V.6b....wow.... no crashes... none.... Great.
<br />
<br />         The battleships and cruisers are great.
<br />
<br />Questions and annoying suggestions...
<br />      - When assaulting a liberty fleet....let's say at Norfolk. I take out a few cruisers and a Dreadnought (Note: I'm using my lvl 38).... when the dreadnought is killed, a new dreadnought patrol group appears out of nowhere....about 2K away... It doesn't even enter through a trade lane....(I blame the programers of Freelancer) 
<br />         This concept works with fighters, but really....a dreadnought? Possible modification...?
<br />
<br />       - Additional random encounter... When assualting a Rheinlander military installation or Battleship Westfallen...only Valkyries and Banshees appear as a counter...no Rheinland gunboats.
<br />
<br />       - After destroying 5 dreadnought battlegroups in liberty....a Rheinland fighter wing  and a liberty cruiser patrol spawns and attacks...
<br />
<br />        - Intergration!!! 
<br />
<br />
<br />BTW Thank you very much for the excellent work, intensive effort, and lots of time spent making this mod for everyone. Thank you!</div>

			<div class="content">A few bugs;
<br />
<br />1) tie defender cannot use weapons of optimal class without upgrades. 5 shots and your outa juice (class 8 sunblast A's and sunblast a turret) have not even attempted trying to deck out a 8/1 heavy fighter with optimal weaps yet.
<br />
<br />2) in a dromedary that has been tweaked it can take forever to dock at certain space stations.. (I.E. freeport 9 with level 3 upgrades)(kinda sucks since the bounty hunters hated me <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  )
<br />
<br />3) same deal with dromedary docking to close to trade lanes. just spins around flying trying to dock.. have to back up and get enough speed.
<br />
<br />4) nomad blasters are dumbed down to 3.03 (ok not a bug but a disappointment)
<br />    before nomad blasters and cannon's did about the same damage per sec. 
<br />    but i guess your making a nomad cannon 'lite' for the heavy fighters :/
<br />
<br />wish list:
<br />make missile max &gt;50 or make em use no ammo (bit unrealistic imho)
<br />increase hit points, turn radius, blast radius, and speed on missiles. (possible for missiles to do blowthrough damage? (i.e. radiation like damage and ignore shields?))
<br />or just increase the speed of the damn torps.
<br />when selling a ship must i always have to repurchase engines and powerplant?
<br />any chance of a shield augmentation or damage resistance add on?
<br />cant sell spare engines
<br />more battleships in other sectors and by different factions <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I wanna kill a corsair battleship in omicron gamma <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />Yeah, a bit too unrealistic for a balancing mod. You should have plenty of money anyway, so just buy a ****load of missles.
<br />
<br />&quot;increase hit points, turn radius, blast radius, and speed on missiles. (possible for missiles to do blowthrough damage? (i.e. radiation like damage and ignore shields?))&quot;
<br />
<br />I think everyone wants missles to be better because the ships move to fast sometimes for missles to hit... I think the ship's cruise and at least the afterburners need to be slown down, becuase I think thats causing small unbalanced problems like this missle issue.
<br />
<br />&quot;or just increase the speed of the damn torps.&quot;
<br />
<br />Maybe by around 25%... torps are big and meant to be slow and powerful... but yet I do think they are a little to slow and underpowered, BUT this is what makes you want to buy missles instead for dogfights.
<br />
<br />&quot;any chance of a shield augmentation or damage resistance add on?&quot;
<br />
<br />I am afraid you will be able to get to a point already where the game is just too easy, and you have all the armour upgrades and the best weapons... allowing more defensive upgrades sounds like you could reach a state of invulernability, and thats just boring...
<br />
<br />&quot;cant sell spare engines&quot;
<br />
<br />Nope... hardcoded so you cannot. Drop the engine in space...
<br />
<br />&quot;more battleships in other sectors and by different factions  I wanna kill a corsair battleship in omicron gamma &quot;
<br />
<br />That does sound pretty cool. Battleships are fun to kill. I have yet to see a random mission where I need to take out a battleship... =\</div>

			<div class="content">Yes, about what Gameshark03 said. When you bring up the system map (F6), and click on something e.g. a station/planet, and click on it's query &quot;?&quot;, the information there still isn't updated. Still mentions selling the old ships etc. Nothing major, just a nit. There were some misspellings too, sorry I forgot to note them down.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, I got all the way to Calif. minor before I noticed &quot;huh? the A-Wing isn't displayed&quot;; forgot to download the slave1 thingy -- was lucky didn't crash. Got creamed during the missions at the Williard base (was that #6?) -- well, not really, but I couldn't take out the fighters fast enough and the battleship Harmony kept being blown up. So I reloaded from previous and did lots (and lots) of $2000-$3000 missions in New York until I saved up enough $$$ for a TIE-fighter (experienced the same low-power situation mentioned a few posts back), then an X-Wing. The TIE fighter is underjuiced perhaps? If I'm not mistaken it's default powerplant is 'bounty hunters light' or something.
<br />
<br />All in all, looks pretty good at the singleplayer start; all the missions I ran in the first ship you get (starfighter?) were tough this time around, cause the Liberty Rogues aren't pushovers anymore. Had the wings blown off on practically every single mission.

			<div class="content">Redlance: about &quot;optimal class&quot; and weapon power consumption problems...I've already increased the power on almost all ships, and if u still have problems firing BUY AN POWER UPGRADE....they are not too expensive, and have generally superior quality. I've included random drops for powerplants in the next version so it should be a new source to updgrade u'r ship...want a Centurion Powerplant? Go kill Centurions! No shield augmentation will be done, the gameplay is perfectly balanced, enemies are tough but not impossible to beat. 
<br />the missile will be improved slightly in turn rate and acceleration, so the less skiled out there to be able to use them more efectively.
<br />Nomads Blaster Prototypes require energy because they are conversions from the original Nomad models to human technology, and they should require power to fire as all human weapons(no pain no gain).
<br />Gameshark and Titanite: There's no millenium falcon yet in the mod, because is no model out there. about the other ships, just read the readme history on this page(page 7) and u'll see the locations to buy them from.  the Tie fighter is not underjuiced at all, it has a Piranha powerplant that should be enough for 4 drails or 4 justices mkIII and a stunpulse turret, but certainly not enough for 2 Pyros type 5 and 2 dragoons type 4, for ex. Go buy a better powerplant, that's why i place them out there!
<br />and Phroot and Redlance, as I said battleship encounters have been heavily modified in the outter worlds an u'll find entire fleets of pirates fighting each other or going after u if they don't have anything better to do. u'll find them all in the next version, alread uploaded here on Lancer's Reactor.</div>

			<div class="content">There is a millinium falcon model.  it is in the BABYLON 5 mod that is on this site.  that MOD also has the bablyon Shadow ship, vorlon fighter and vorlon planetkiller, white star cruiser, the kilrathi Dralthi, and nomad ships.  The millinium falcon looks good but needs a little better texturing.

<br />the HOSTILE UNIVERSE MOD version 3 has the babylon 5 star fury, then two ships from Battle star Galactica,  the cylon fighter and the fighter the humans used (don't remember the prober name for them.)</div>

			<div class="content">LoL, those were just initial observations, don't worry <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I certainly believe in making the player 'work' for the upgrades -- after all, that's part of the fun too besides blowing things up in pretty explosions!
<br />
<br />...I know it's a beta and all, but do you want us to look out for mistakes in the infocards and everything? Spelling etc. Could make a quick list of the ones I notice while flying around (I'm the type who absolutely must land on each base and scroll through everything even though I'm pretty sure my equip already fits my needs, lol).
<br />
<br />Edit: I assume we still have to dl separately the Slave1/AWing pack?

			<div class="content">Thanks for the reply MD. I seen the update on battleships on border and edge worlds.. One word.. SAWEET!
<br />
<br />anyhow on the powerplant issue I understand.. It just stank since i saved my pennies to buy the tie defender and couldnt use the weaps i had on my tweaked out awing. Since i lost all my upgrades except armour in the sell. so i had a ship that could only fire 5 times before running out of juice. good thing i reverted back a save and earnd a few more bucks.. and headed back to freeport 9 for upgrades again.
<br />
<br />drooling with anticipation for new ships <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> time to find the cylon ship.. too bad no colonial viper yet <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">First things first: MD, what a hell of a wonderful work you've done here. Two thumbs up, way up! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />And second things second ^_^ Since everyone's suggesting to add new ships, I'll ask you something: do you know anything about an anime series called Cowboy Bebop? (Those who know must have thought the same thing I thought the first time I entered a trade lane ^_^ ) There's a huge lot of ships from that series that could be imported into the FL universe -it's centered in a bounty hunter, after all-, but I've seen the model of Spike Spiegel's Swordfish II around, but without any textures. Putting some color on that thing would be piece of cake for such a consumate modder as yourself -and an impossible quest for a newbie as myself <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /> -, so I humbly ask if it would be possible to include it in some release yet to come. I would post a suggestion about the ship stats, but you are the modder, not myself -I WANT TO LEARN! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> -. 
<br />
<br />Keep up the good work!
<br />
<br />P.D.: I downloaded a model for that fighter that has been done in BSP/XMESH formats. Should you know what to use to edit that thing, please tell me!
<br />
<br />
<br />&quot;Let me say that again. Don't. Mess. With. Powers.&quot;
