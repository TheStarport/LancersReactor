			<div class="content">I am curious to know what stuff didnt mkae into WC games from WC1-WCP. Some of the stuff thats in the game files but isnt implemented in the game or a idea that didnt make into final cut.
<br />Ok for starters Privateer:
<br />The 5th ship speeder, rumor about ammo depo in a asteroid.
<br />In WC3 original Bemoths destruction in Kilarh system not in Loki.
<br />In WC4 I think dragons weapons layout was suposed to be 2fusion guns, 2thacyon guns and 2 fission guns. Btw is it me or is the animation fission cannon uses same as fusions in RF.
<br />
<br />Well this is just a tip of the iceberg, but if you know more the info would be welcome.

			<div class="content">Well, in Wing Commander Privateer, a few systems had starfields like Freelancer, but they were disabled because in the more complicated systems, like New Constantinople, the computers of the time slowed down to much, and the game became unplayable.
<br />There was, originally, a way to purchase every ship in the game, and more weapons than in the official release.
<br />Again, the computers of the time couldn't handle as much as was originally planned.
<br />
<br />In Privateer 2, The Darkening, it was originally set up so that you could get some ships from Joe the Bartender.
<br />(Like the &quot;Unknown&quot; Talon ship.)
<br />IIRC, it was removed because it required an additional 1.5 CD's, and they wanted to keep costs down, and felt that players didn't want to be swapping disks so often.
<br />
<br />IIRC, the Wing Commander Academy was originally supposed to be part of one of the other games, but time, costs, and other considerations required that it be released by itself.
<br />
<br />In WCIII, The Heart of the Tiger, there were several missions planned for the base where you refuel on your way to destroy Kilrah.
<br />IIRC, they were removed because they required about 1/5th of another CD, and they didn't want to spend the money on it.
<br />
<br />In Wing Commander IV, The Price of Freedom, there was originally a series of missions against the genetically engineered Dragon pilot, but they were removed due to save on the number of CD's required, and that they added little to the game.
<br />
<br />Of course, some of the above may just be rumors, but as far as I know, are correct.
<br />

			<div class="content">It sounds interesting pitty they didnt make into final version because of costs or thech limits. Baldurs Gate 2 has a mod thats called Unfinished Buisness that restores some quests and items that were not implemented or had invalid strings. Could something similar be done with lets say Privateer - WCP?
<br />
<br />In WCP there should have been cloacks but my guess is that when the buggs could detect them with naked eye they became obsolete. So some of the dialouge is there as is the dvice(it showed up with ship editor). Second thing main caps ship guns were never made to use them althoug they should have and guns are in the file.

<br />The armada engine was one step foward, but I guess it has the same problem. The second problem would be TRE files.

<br />Yes and no, same animations for ship selling could be used just change of text. The problem would be the landing scens, weapon sell/buy changes. As for voices thats a small thing. Btw a good artist could crank up art for most things, its the coding that is the hard thing. If needed some animations could be copied from Strike Commander and revorked.
<br />Any detail info on the weapons that were removed, what type?

			<div class="content">In WCP there is the shield killer weapon that Nephilm should use, but it has no effect in game play. It apers that most of the stuff there is half done.
<br />*sigh*What I wouldnt give a game that has best features from I-WAR2, Freespace2, WCP &amp; Privateer.
<br />
<br />&quot;history abhors a paradox&quot;
<br />&quot;There&#8217;s a little going-away present, &#8217;cause you&#8217;re going away &#8212; permanently!&quot;
<br />&quot;Mess with the viper and you will get the fang&quot;
