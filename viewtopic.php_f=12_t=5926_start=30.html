			<div class="content">Hmmmm, where to start. First of all...sorry if I seemed hostile, didn't mean to get all defensive. Anyway, about the telescope thing. I was watching the press conference with NASA yesterday and they said that on a previous mission the drag chute door actually fell off during launch. They used ground based telescopes to try to see what happened and they couldn't see anything helpful. They basically said you would get enough resolution to be able to tell that the bottom of the shuttle was black, something I hope they already knew. Think of this another way, sure we have super powerful telescopes that can see distant galaxies...but imagine using a pair of binoculars to see something right in your face. You get a blurry mess. I realize we have spy stuff that reads license plates...but that license plate isnt speeding past the camera at 17,500 mph. Plus spy satellites are looking at the ground. To get the pictures that are helpful, they would first have to orient the shuttle so it is facing where the satellite will be. Shouldn't be too tough, but they would have to reposition the satellite so that it wasn't facing the earth but instead into space. That is something that may or may not be possible. They would also have to get the military to relinquish the control of their satellite. Why go to that trouble if you are confident there isn't a problem.
<br />
<br />According to NASA they lose tiles all the time, so far it has never caused a safety problem. Everything they knew told them that this was no different. They trusted the math they used all the time and were possibly wrong.
<br />
<br />About an EVA, remember their calculations told them there was no safety problem, so they were probably not willing to risk the life of an astronaut just to check a few tiles.
<br />
<br />I pray that this was just an accident, that negligence did not contribute to this disaster. NASA's only failure may have been the failure of imagination. They failed to imagine that their external fuel tank had design problems.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that a while a mid-launch abort was possible, they didn't know about the debris until a few days later. Try to accept the fact that even if they did find out that there was severe tile damage, the outcome of this flight would not have changed. The only thing that would change is that they would know the cause of this accident.
<br />
<br />They have already stated that they could not change the trajectory of re-entry, because they already use the optimal trajectory to minimize stress on the shuttle.
<br />
<br />I think you'll agree with me that if NASA actually thought that this debris posed a safety issue then they would have done everything possible to find out. Remember hindsight is always 20/20.
<br />
<br />For their calculations. They know enough of physics to be able to calulate every little thing about the debris to make it reliable and not &quot;guess work&quot;. The problem is that they may have trusted the calculations too much and went on the assumption of where the debris struck instead of assuming a worse-case scenario. So even though the math was correct, the starting assumption may have been bad. With a bad assumption you can quadruple check it, you'll still get the wrong answer.
<br />
<br />On a side note, being a resident of Central Florida. Over the past few years I have taken it for granted; the ability to go outside and watched a shuttle launch, which I did for this last flight, or hearing/feeling the twin sonic booms when a shuttle returns safely. Never again.
<br />
<br />I pray that at the end of this investigation the problem will be solved, and NASA gets back to flying. Anything less would mean these 7 brave souls died in vain. If you ever have an oppurtunity to see a future launch, take it. It is truly a spectacular sight, especially the night time launches. Television can't touch seeing it in person.</div>

<br />yes it's possible to get resolution on ground based telescopes considering they can get good pictures of galaxies far far away, perhaps they may not have been in the right position, however it was an option unexplored
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Yes. Telescopes designed to look at galaxies far, far away, not spacecraft whizzing by at god knows how fast. It's easy to say &quot;oh well it can take a picture of a galaxy a billion light years away&quot; but when you do the math, it simply isn't going to work.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />oh, and reading up on the satelites in the paper, they do have limited manueverability to take space photos.
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Yes. Space photos of objects that are probably far away and given the distance between the two objects, aren't moving very fast. Assuming a sattelite with such capabilities happens to be within range of the disabled shuttle, it has to be fine tuning it's orientation REALLY fast, for something that spends most of it's time looking straight down.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />even to me it seems asinine to entrust the lives of seven people to complex calculations written on paper without even trying to double check somehow.
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Every time a human is launched into space, they are putting their lives in the hands of the people who make insanely complex calculations written on paper. And believe me, this crap is double checked.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />another theory tossed around at nasa was that they could have brought them in at a different trajectory to offset the heavily damaged tiles.
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Yep, coming in at a much shallower angle, making the chances of a safe landing a lot lower.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />but it bothers me that nasa didn't do everything possible to bring them home safely, then have a spokesperson with the audacity to claim that there wasn't anything they could have done about it anyway.
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Of course they did. Everything impossible doesn't just include trying to see where the damage is, or what not. It's about designing the best vehicle to their abilities, that has the highest chance to return it's crew. Once they were in orbit, there was nothing they could have done. A space walk would have been suicidal, so repairing it would be out of the question, even if they somehow got pictures of that spot to see what kind of work would be done.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>
<br />I'm just so sick and tired of being patted on the head and being told, everythings allright. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I don't quite understand this. Anyway, let's pretend that somehow there was a way to get a good quality high-res picture of the underside of the shuttle. What then? What do you think they should have done, based on the information you've learned? I'm not trying to flame or be insulting, I'm merely curious.</div>

<br />you are right, even if they could have got pictures there really wasn't anything that could have been done.. a space walk would have been suicidal, and it wasn't possible to dock at the ISS.
<br />i dunno.. i just felt so angered that nothing could be done to save them.

			<div class="content">I know how you feel....I just had to do something last night so I checked out the official report from the challenger accident. Excellent pictures, the thing that went through my mind is that if the right solid rocket booster had a jet of flame coming out of it that was obvious...why didnt they abort. That one really puzzles me, I figured they had people watching view of the left AND right side of the shuttle during launch...guess not. The left side was the only visible side from the TV footage. Anyway, if you are at all interested in the Challenger accident check it out. It's very interesting reading.

			<div class="content">Well boys, it's certainly a tragic ordeal.  Here's my .02.  Columbia didn't have the EVA equipped for this misison, even if they did, the damaged area was outside it's range.  A spacewalk to repair it would have been suicidal, but even if it wasn't, <i>Columbia didn't have any spare tiles on board </i>.  They had no supplies to repair the tiles.  Someone else mentioned it, tiles had fallen off before, it wasn't a catastrophic event (in their eyes at that time).  No, they couldn't have docked with the ISS, their orbits were not similar.  Columbia wasn't carrying enough fuel to be jetting around up there.  As for the guesswork part, someone else said it best, NASA has some of the best and the brightest, if I wanted someone do be guessing, it would be NASA.  I truly feel this was an accident, and that if NASA felt there was a danger, they wouldn't have brought them down.  They mentioned it in their interview, everything that day seemed perfect, the weather was good, the shuttle was on a good approach vector, everything seemed fine.  There's not much that could be done.    
<br />
<br />Ok, I said all that to say all this.   I'm disappointed that NASA is still using shuttles designed back in the 60s and 70s.  Sure, they were designed to last, but when it comes to something as dangerous as NASA's line of work, they deserve to be using cutting edge equipment.  From what I've read about the tile technology on the shuttles, I'm very concerned.  Hopefully, something good will come of this and new funds will rejuvenate NASA as a result.  With funding, they can make something a lot more secure and top of the line.  
<br />
<br />That's my .02.

			<div class="content">Something I'd like to add... Hand holds on the underside of the shuttle would be dangerous, considering they would burn off every time you reentered, and if you brushed up against the underside, you could do a lot of damage. Despite not moving very fast into it, an astronaut in EVA equipment still has a lot of mass, which could easily damage a bunch of tiles. If they had one of the SAFER jetpacks it would be possible, but they would have to constantly thrust back to the surface because they would be pushing off as they installed more tiles, eventually running out of fuel and stranding them.
<br />
<br />The only thing that could save them would have been the OSP system as well as the orbital space tug things they are working on... Those won't be around for a while though, assuming they aren't stepped back completely.</div>

			<div class="content">@ms... exactly the point.. NASA is being forced to use older shuttles due to budget cuts.. i don't have any figures handy, but i do recall tha they were significant cutbacks
<br />
<br /> ...Just a random thought from a random mind</div>
