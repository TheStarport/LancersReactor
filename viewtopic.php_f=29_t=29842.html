			<div class="content">Didn't see one around here, so I thought it would be ok to start one. Specifically, I'm looking for a tutorial or better yet, flowchart on how this berzerko ini system goes from one file to another for the most asked for topics. Like how the missions go from the vignette ini to the pilots population ini to the pilots_story.ini (hadn't a clue about that one until I saw Warzog's recent AI release) to solars.ini to the loadouts.ini. etc...  I'm not sure if anyone is up to pathing the insane micrologic through these things, but I am sure that a) if it can be done, it'll make modding MUCH easier, and b) the people here are the only ones that have a snowball's chance in a supernova of doing so <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Thanks!

<br />
<br />*edit* - sorry, have hijacked your thread Tred, rather than making another one <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Hope you don't mind <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<h3><a href="#p266418" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Missions/mbases.ini - contains information about NPC's on bases, including their names, whom they are etc, rumours (via ids numbers), secrets, bribes on offer, whether the NPC's/ The BASE give out missions, and the level of those missions
<br />
<br />missions/npcships.ini - contains information about the ships that the NPC's fly, linked directly towards the loadouts.ini file, and also the faction_prop.ini file. Basically - npcships.ini file links these files together for the faction_prop.ini file to use as &quot;encounters&quot; and stuff: Also holds the npc ships difficulty level.
<br />Shiparch.ini
<br />Loadouts.ini (or loadouts_special.ini etc)
<br />pilots_population.ini
<br />formations.ini
<br />shipclass.ini
<br />
<br />The others interlink kinda
<br />
<br />missions/Empathy.ini file - contains info about how the factions react to YOU when u do mission for a faction etc, and shoot them/please them, as well as how all toehr factions respond to you doing it for one faction etc.
<br />
<br />Missions/faction_props.ini file - contains info about the formations, names, voices, legallity, scanning of cargo as contraband/wanting it, ships to fly etc, and the factions names, how they are reffered to (voices) and more. EXTREMEMLY closely linked to NPCships.ini 
<br />
<br />missions/lootprops.ini - contains info about the drop rates of stuff by npcs
<br />missions/news.ini - contains the ids links to text for bases as news items.
<br />missions/ptough.ini - money and level area
<br />missions/formations.ini - formations and their &quot;design&quot; - basicalyl the ships positions in formations, and where the player joins them
<br />
<br />
<br />random missions folder:
<br />rmlootinfo.ini - stuff dropped by npc's when killed in random misions
<br />diff2money.ini - mission (random) payouts to difficulty levels
<br />Killablesolars.ini - types of missions given out by the NPC factions. The ones with faction name appearing in the lines for them are giving that mission type. Don't worry if you don't understand, you gotta learn to walk before doing a marathon!
<br />The rest you needn't worry about at this time. Its not important <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Cockpits folder - contains all cockpits for ships - basically contains the turret cam info, and rotation speed etc.
<br />
<br />Thats more than enough for 99% of modders.
<br />
<br />To make systems, your universe folder contains the systems folders. each system has its own folder, along with the system file inside that folder.
<br />So:
<br />
<br />Universe/systems/li01/li01.ini ;contains information about liberty system New York
<br />Universe/sytems/Rh01/Rh01.ini contains all systems inofmation for new berlin.
<br />
<br />Okay, inside these folders (systems folders) they have a bases folder, whre the file for bases are contained. These files only contain links to the &quot;rooms&quot; of the base, which are contained inthe rooms folder (inside bases folder). The rooms foler contains links to the backgrounds, music played, character position (by points on the CMP for base) and other things. It also contains the links for the buttons inside the base etc.
<br />
<br />Going backwards, the audio/sounds.ini contains the links to sound files (sound effects) for the game. The music.ini file contains the music links.
<br />
<br />The FX folder contains the files that deal with the effects of stuff. The main effects.ini file deals with the weapons, wormholes etc etc etc.
<br />Beam effects are the actual stuff SEEN in the game by the guns, but you MUST have them referenced inthe effects.ini file to work.
<br />
<br />explosions.ini file is also in here, and obviously contains links to the effects for different types of explosions used in the game.

			<div class="content">Good lordy lou, what a braindump! Thanks Chips!
<br />Hmm, I don't see anything here that couldn't be stored in a single database file, all linked up and ready to slap a front end on. Does anyone but me get the impression that after Chris Roberts left the project, MS gave it to a bunch of interns to cut their teeth on before they got into &quot;real programming&quot;?
<br />Sigh, at least  I'm nearly done with Fly or Die. Just have to grit my teeth and edit the battlesizes (down) in every encounters file, and it'll be ready for the finishing touches.  Hope people like it <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
