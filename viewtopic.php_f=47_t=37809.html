<br />@ All you fanfic writers out there: This story is completly made up by me, and any similarities to your stories are coincidental, because I have only read mabye four or five fanfics here.
<br />
<br />Sorry, kind of a slow beginning. If you think it was boring then just tell me and I will try to spice my next chapters up a bit. (If my story lasts long enough for a few chapters.)

			<div class="content">Ok guys, I&#8217;ve decided to completely redo my Project: Revolution Fan Fic, even though I have only put one episode up.  So if you decide to read this, then just forget I ever posted the original first episode of Project Revolution. This is set four years after the Nomad incident, and The Order is now in possession of the strange alien artifact that started the whole thing. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Project: Revolution Chapter 1
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;You should find your target at the waypoint we&#8217;ve set up for you. Refer to your Nav Map for more details.&#8221; This was a voice that Trent was getting very tired of hearing. He already knew the assignment, fly to point A, kill some Liberty Rouges, use the tractor beam, and bring Dean Fisher back to Planet Manhattan for pickup.
<br />
<br />Trent picked up his microphone and said, &#8220;Confirmed Mission Commission, I&#8217;ve done this a million times as I&#8217;m sure your computer tells you.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Trent turned off the radio communication to the Mission Commission and docked with the trade lane that would take him to West Point Military Academy, then another trade lane to the abandoned Ithaca Research Station in the Badlands. 
<br />
<br />This was a boring flight off of Manhattan, and it gave him some time to think. Him and King had gotten into a big argument, and Juni was on assignment for the LSF in Texas.
<br />
<br />It had been so long that Trent couldn&#8217;t even remember why he and King had that fight in the first place. We were probably just really drunk, Trent thought to himself as his Anubis emerged from the trade lane at West Point.
<br />
<br />His ship coasted up to the trade lane and activated the docking procedure that Trent had become so accustomed to. Still, he preferred to fly his ship himself, and not give the computer a chance to take over. 
<br />
<br />As Trent was pressed back against his seat and his ship jolted forward, he tried to remember what the fight between him and King was all about. Then it came to him.
<br />
<br />It was an LSF mission gone horribly wrong in California. They were supposed to bring an Outcast convict back to the Battleship Yukon in orbit above Los Angeles for interrogation, but the Outcasts and a group of Rouges followed them. 
<br />
<br />A Liberty Cruiser was passing by the planet when him and King arrived with Jose Sanchez, the Outcasts and Rouges in hot pursuit. Neither of them thought that the pirate ships had torpedoes aboard.
<br />
<br />What they didn&#8217;t know is that there was a field trip of elementary school children aboard the Cruiser who were learning about the sophisticated computers on the ship. As Trent and King were about to dock with the Mississippi, the pirate ships launched all the torpedoes they had aboard. 
<br />
<br />But unfortunately the Liberty Cruiser was just moving in the path, and it was obliterated instead of them. The Rouges and Outcast ships were destroyed by a group of Bounty Hunters as they were trying to escape. 
<br />
<br />King had blamed Trent for not killing them before they got within firing distance of Los Angeles, and the guilt had been eating him up inside for almost three years. King had moved off to Rhineland still very angry at Trent and even Juni for not being there to help. 
<br />
<br />Trent pushed those thoughts in the back of his mind as he neared the end of the trade lane, with Ithaca now in clear view. He saw the Rouge ships on his monitor, and selected Dean Fisher&#8217;s ship as his primary target. 
<br />
<br />He wasted no time in destroying the ship and, when the Escape Pod appeared on his contact list, he activated his tractor beam and pulled the pod into his cargo hold. Then as fast as he came, he was gone, leaving the Rouges bewildered. 
<br />
<br />As soon as he touched down on Manhattan, three armed guards were waiting. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you Mr. Trent, the Bounty Hunter&#8217;s Guild is in your debt once again.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;The pods in the hold guys, now if I could just get my three hundred-fifty thousand credits I&#8217;ll be on my way.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />The soldiers just stared at him, almost as if they were hoping he would forget about the bounty. But when he saw the ad for Dean Fisher with a reward for three hundred-fifty thousand credits, he just couldn&#8217;t refuse.
<br />
<br />After he had gotten paid and the escape pod removed from his cargo hold, he went into the bar and ordered a Liberty Ale, something he had hated at first, but then later found it to his liking. 
<br />
<br />It was hot in the bar, so for the first time in thirteen hours, Trent took off his flight jacket and placed it on the bar stool beside him when his Neural Net Communicator beeped. He pressed the flashing green button on the side of his watch and a holographic image of Juni floated above his communicator, illuminating the dark corner around him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, this is Juni. We&#8217;ve finished our job in Texas and I&#8217;m coming back to New York, will you wait for me?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sure, but you have to bring me a Sidewinder fang from Houston, deal?&#8221; Trent asked sarcastically. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, I&#8217;m waiting in line at the Jump Gate, do you think you can hold off a little longer?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine, just forget about it, I&#8217;ll be here.&#8221; Trent said, clearly disappointed. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Trent finished his drink and sat in the bar for forty-five minutes before he finally called Juni on his NN comunicator again.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Juni? Are you still coming? Hello?&#8221; He said, now starting to get a little worried.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes I&#8217;m here Trent, we got jumped by Liberty Rouges in the trade lane from the Jump Gate, I haven&#8217;t got paid yet and my ship&#8217;s burned pretty bad. I don&#8217;t think this piece of crap can hold together for a planetary landing, can you meet me at Newark?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are you OK?&#8221; Trent asked, already knowing the answer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes I&#8217;m fine. Now are you going to meet me at Newark or not? I just need enough credits to get my ship fixed. I know you just got paid three hundred-fifty thousand credits.&#8221; She said, sounding annoyed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, now who&#8217;s begging for money? I&#8217;ll be there in a few minutes.&#8221; Trent said, but before getting up, ordered another Liberty Ale.
<br />
<br />
<br />Damn, twenty-five minutes for one drink, that&#8217;s a new personal record, Trent thought to himself as he walked out to the landing pad. 
<br />
<br />He was climbing into his ship when he realized he had left his jacket in the bar. 
<br />
<br />So he slowly got back out of his ship and walked as slow as he possibly could to the bar, where he found his jacket on the counter. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Forget something?&#8221; Asked the bartender as politely as he could.
<br />
<br />Trent just nodded and grabbed his coat. 
<br />
<br />After putting it on and making it back to the landing pad, he was ready to get into his Anubis. 
<br />
<br />Trent remembered how when Juni rejoined the LSF she foolishly traded in her Anubis for a Defender. So stupid, Trent thought to himself.
<br />
<br />Just before Trent climbed into the cockpit, a man called his name. &#8220;Mr. Trent, we have to talk. It&#8217;s urgent.&#8221; The man was too far off to recognize, so Trent was forced to get out of his ship and walk over to a part of the landing pad hidden in the shadow of the building.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Who are you? I don&#8217;t have time for any games.&#8221; Trent said into the seemingly empty alleyway. Trent waited for a reply, but none came. &#8220;Look, whoever you are, I don&#8217;t have time for this.&#8221; Trent said, and was answered with silence. So, giving up, Trent turned and started to walk away. He had only taken three steps when a pale hand grabbed the collar of his jacket and pulled him back into the darkness.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now Mr. Trent, I don&#8217;t want to have to resort to violence.&#8221; The man said, putting his hand around a pistol at his side, his face hidden from view by the shadows.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you want with me? I&#8217;m supposed to be meeting somebody now.&#8221; Trent said, now starting to get a bad feeling in his stomach.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You must take this. Everyone wants it, people are being killed for this.&#8221; The man said, shoving a strange white object into Trent&#8217;s hand.
<br />
<br />He had to hold it up to the light to realize what it was. Finally he said, &#8220;Where did you get this? All alien artifacts are illegal in the colonies, especially those thought to be Dom Kavash! Take this back, I don&#8217;t want it!&#8221; Trent said, remembering what had happened here four years ago tomorrow.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, it is too important. You must take it and give it to Orillion! If Liberty finds out about this, they will kill everyone who had anything to do with it! You must take this back to the Osiris. I will contact you later.&#8221; The man said, about to walk off when he caught sight of two LSF officers walking towards them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think I see somebody over here. Let&#8217;s check it out.&#8221; One of the officers said, the other just nodded and began walking over to Trent and the strange man.
<br />
<br />Huh, d&#233;j&#224; vu, Trent thought to him self, and pocketed the artifact. When he turned his head, he saw the man pulling out his gun and adjusting the setting by a little knob on the bottom of the handle. 
<br />
<br />Trent saw the LCD screen on the handle of the pistol say &#8220;Inferred.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey! What are you doing? You don&#8217;t really want to kill them, do you?&#8221; Trent asked, getting very nervous.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Not to worry Mr. Trent, inferred lasers can only kill if it is a head shot, I&#8217;m not going to shoot them.&#8221; He said. &#8220;I just put my pistol on this setting so they won&#8217;t be able to see the shots.&#8221; The man said, aiming the gun at the hover-barge carrying dozens of containers of Hydrogen Fuel.
<br />
<br />Before Trent could stop the man, he pulled the trigger, letting four silent shots ring through the air. They hit the H Fuel containers and they were all engulfed in flames and a violent explosion. 
<br />
<br />It was too far away to hurt the guards, but close enough to get their attention. They turned and ran over to the fire to see if anyone was hurt, and the man seized the opportunity to escape.
<br />
<br />He bolted across the landing pad, where Trent finally recognized him. It was the same man who had given him the Dom Kavash artifact one year ago! A man who everyone thought was dead.
<br />
<br />The man climbed into his Rhino freighter and sped off, leaving behind all of his commodities that Trent assumed were supposed to be loaded into his ship.
<br />
<br />When Trent walked out of the alleyway one of the LSF officers noticed him and pointed him out to the other.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What were you doing back there? Did you do that?&#8221; The first officer asked, pointing to what used to be the hover-barge with the containers of H Fuel, now emitting a plume of smoke into the early evening Manhattan sky.
<br />
<br />&#8220;And how would I have done that? Huh? Do you see a gun on me?&#8221; Trent asked sarcastically, just realizing that was the dumbest thing he could have said, given his present circumstances. You IDIOT! He thought to himself, now they are going to search you for sure! And if they find the artifact, they will KILL you! 
<br />
<br />Trent remembered watching one of President Jacobi&#8217;s speeches after the Nomad incident. 
<br />
<br />She had made it very clear, that because of past events all alien artifacts are banned from Liberty, and anyone caught in violation of this new law was to be shot and killed on-site!
<br />
<br />But strangely, Trent agreed with the new law this time, after what had happened, he learned the dangers of alien artifacts. He had even suggested the new law to President Jacobi, but she had come up with the &#8220;execution&#8221; part herself. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Put your hands on your head and get down on your knees.&#8221; Ordered one of the guards, pulling out his pistol.
<br />
<br />Trent did as he was told, after all, what else could he do? They had guns, he didn&#8217;t. He was now at their mercy.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Keep your hands on your head and stand up, and turn around.&#8221; The officer ordered as he walked up to him, aiming his pistol right at Trent&#8217;s head.
<br />
<br />Trent was wondering what he could do when the guard ordered him to take his jacket off. 
<br />
<br />Again, he did as he was told. The officer tossed Trent&#8217;s jacket over to his partner, where he checked all the pockets.
<br />
<br />Then it happened, the thing Trent had been most afraid of.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What the hell is this?&#8221; The man asked, pulling out the white artifact from the jacket&#8217;s right pocket. &#8220;Is this an alien artifact? You do know the law don&#8217;t you? All artifact smugglers are to be shot and killed on-site!&#8221; The man hesitated. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;But you&#8217;re lucky. You didn&#8217;t put up a fight, so we&#8217;ll spare your life. However, you&#8217;re still under arrest and will have to come with us. Lay down on the ground now! &#8216;Spread Eagle.&#8217; &#8220; The officer barked. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Can I at least have my jacket back? It&#8217;s cold out here. It&#8217;s like what, forty-two degrees here?&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Request sir?&#8221; The officer asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Denied. He&#8217;ll be plenty warm in that arrest pod in our cargo hold.&#8221; The one who wore a more official uniform said. The looked at Trent and said. &#8220;Now, I know you heard him. Get down on the ground.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent let out a sigh, and laid down on the ground, arms and legs spread apart. 
<br />
<br />He was cuffed and thrown into an &#8220;Arrest pod,&#8221; that could only be opened from the outside. 
<br />
<br />The Defender lifted off the landing pad and flew off in the direction of the police station.

			<div class="content">Alright, you have been waiting, and here it is.
<br />
<br />P.S. Sorry, but I couldn't come up with a subtitle for this one.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Project: Revolution Chapter 2
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look officer , I know my rights. One NN call, you can&#8217;t put me in a cell until I get that call.&#8221; Trent said to the jail guard, who just laughed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You're trying to smuggle alien artifacts in Liberty, and you want a freaking NN call? Hah! You should&#8217;ve been shot and killed on the landing pad. I don&#8217;t see why they even had to bring you back here in their arrest pod. You should&#8217;ve come back here in a body bag.&#8221; The guard said, taking a long drink of his Rheinlander Vodka.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look, I read the laws before I ever came to Liberty in the first place. It was about all I had to do on the rescue ship from Freeport Seven. If you&#8217;re arrested then you have the rights to one Neural Net call to whoever you want.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ha! Those laws only apply to citizens of Liberty. The law doesn&#8217;t say you live here on Manhattan, my computer tells me you still live on Leeds with your &#8216;legal guardian&#8217; Tobias. So it looks to me like those so-called rights you have don&#8217;t apply to you. Now shut up, I&#8217;m trying to watch TV.&#8221; The guard said, picking up the remote control lying on the table beside him.
<br />
<br />He flipped to the Liberty News Network where he finally put down the remote and leaned back in his chair. &#8220;Good evening, and welcome to LNN. The assignation of Prince John in Dublin earlier this afternoon has put Bretonia on &#8216;Code Red&#8217; security. The queen has ordered battleships to all Jump Gates and known Jump Holes of New London, where her two daughters live. The queen is still in mourning over the loss of her son, and declined us an int-&#8220; The guard changed the channel. &#8220;Boring.&#8221; He said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey! I was watching that!&#8221; Trent yelled to the guard across the room.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn it, I told you to shut the hell up!&#8221; The guard yelled, throwing the empty Vodka bottle at Trent&#8217;s cell. It just shattered when it hit the bulletproof-glass door.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Will you at least give me my call? I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s asking for too much.&#8221; Trent asked, clearly getting angry.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Only if it&#8217;ll shut you up. My God. You&#8217;re worse than my five year old niece.&#8221; He slurred. The Vodka was clearly taking affect. Of course, Rheinlander Vodka was the strongest drink in the colonies, and Trent was surprised that the guard could hold in almost a whole bottle before even starting to show it.
<br />
<br />The guard pressed a button on the counter, and the bulletproof-glass door opened. The only thing separating Trent from the guard were sixteen titanium bars, running vertically from top to bottom.
<br />
<br />The guard tossed Trent&#8217;s NN communicator through the bars, and he caught it with his right hand.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Five minutes.&#8221; The guard said, now sounding really drunk.
<br />
<br />Trent sat in his cell for a minute, trying to decide whom he should call. He thought about Juni, but realized there probably wasn&#8217;t much she could do about it. Maybe King? He thought to himself. But thought it was best to leave King out of this, the last time they had talked, things weren&#8217;t pretty. Then it hit him like a ton of bricks.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey, you mind giving me a little privacy here?&#8221; Trent asked the guard sarcastically. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your just lucky I got to make a pit-stop. And you&#8217;ve got three minutes left by the way.&#8221; He said as he was getting up. He pressed the button and closed the bulletproof-glass barrier and walked out of the room.
<br />
<br />Trent pressed the green button on his NN communicator, and a contact list appeared as a hologram above the watch. He scrolled down past Juni, King and even Orillion, all the way down to Tobias. He pressed the green button again and waited. 
<br />
<br />Finally a holographic image of Tobias appeared in front of him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, what&#8217;s going on? Do you have any idea what time it is here on Leeds?&#8221; Tobias said sheepishly. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tobias, how many credits do you have right now?&#8221; Trent asked, hoping it would be enough for the bail.
<br />
<br />&#8220;About thirty-two thousand, why? Are you in trouble again?&#8221; He asked, remembering what had happened four years ago. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;You could say that, I got caught with another artifact.&#8221; He said, almost knowing Tobias was ready to shoot him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Another one? Trent, what have you been doing? Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I can&#8217;t help you. I just know I don&#8217;t have enough credits to bail someone out of jail for possession of alien artifacts. What about that Orileon fellow? I&#8217;m sure he would be able to do something.&#8221; He said, clearly on the verge of falling back asleep.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine. Thanks anyway Tobias, you&#8217;re such a good, loving relative.&#8221; Trent said harshly. &#8220;Maybe I should call Orillion, because I know he could get me out of here.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent pressed the red button and the image of Tobias faded. Trent estimated that he still had about two minutes left, and he knew the guard was probably puking his guts out on the bathroom floor.
<br />
<br />He called Orillion and explained what had happened, again.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not still active is it?&#8221; Orillion asked as soon as he found out what was going on.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Not the last time I saw it. I don&#8217;t know where these idiots put it, I haven&#8217;t seen it sense they took it from me on the landing pad.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look on your communicator, tell me exactly where you are. I may be able to get you out of there.&#8221; Orillion said, almost as if he could do something about it. But seeing no point in arguing, Trent looked at his watch.
<br />
<br />&#8220;About twenty-eight degrees north, thirty-four degrees west. Why?&#8221; Trent wondered.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look above you, you should see a ventilation duct.&#8221; Orillion instructed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, I see it. I also see that it&#8217;s bolted to the ceiling. What do you want me to do, teleport up there?&#8221; Trent asked sarcastically.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, how long have you been in that holding cell?&#8221; He asked, almost as if he had a plan.
<br />
<br />&#8220;About an hour, why? What does that have anything to do with this?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just wait about ten more minutes, our man will get you out of there.&#8221; Orillion said, and turned off his communicator, killing the connection.
<br />
<br />Trent just sat in his cell, trying to make sense of it all. Juni was probably pissed at him for not coming; he was supposed to meet her on Newark Station almost three hours ago. He didn&#8217;t dare think of calling King, not after what happened three years ago.
<br />
<br />Finally, after at least ten minutes of just sitting there, the guard came back from the restroom, clearly not any more sober than when he left. He flopped down in his chair and turned the TV up one channel to the LNN. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re following breaking news now, President Jacobi has just been shot four times in the chest. We are now going live to our field correspondent Lance Freeman, Lance.&#8221; The anchorman spoke, switching over to Lance.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tom we are here at the Sleeping Dove Fine Dining restaurant at the very North of Los Angeles. President Jacobi had made a dinner reservation here only hours ago, when she arrived and stepped out of her cruiser a lone gunman attempted to take her life with a well-placed headshot. The gunman was apprehended and taken into custody, and I have just received word that President Jacobi is in stable condition. She is being transported to Living Hope Hospital only a few miles away. No more information has been released thus far. Back to you Tom.&#8221; The man said, now out of breath.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Boring.&#8221; The guard said, and flipped the channel.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey! Will you please stop doing that?&#8221; Trent yelled, now getting very irritated with him. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;And what if I don&#8217;t? Are you going to do something about it?&#8221; He asked sarcastically.
<br />
<br />Trent knew there was nothing he could do, he was stuck in a holding cell with titanium bars and reinforced bulletproof-glass, and the guard had a rifle resting on the table beside him, and a pistol in his waist holster. 
<br />
<br />Trent sat in the cell for over an hour. All he could do was think of possible ways to escape, and think of ways he would like to torture the guard. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Another twenty minutes of just sitting there, it was driving Trent insane. He hated waiting more than anything. Finally, Trent yelled across the room to the drunken guard. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey! How much longer are you going to keep me in here? I&#8217;m really getting sick of the way you smell.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn it boy! If you don&#8217;t shut the hell up, I&#8217;m going wring your stupid little neck. You probably ain&#8217;t never coming out of there. You should be in the morgue.&#8221; The guard yelled, sounding as drunk as humanly possible.
<br />
<br />He reached over to the refrigerator and pulled out another bottle of Rheinlander Vodka. Before he had a chance to open it, the door to the hallway opened, the intense light penetrated through the room, making the guard groan uncomfortably. Another guard stepped in and closed the door behind him. The room was once again lit by the dim glow of the TV.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your shift&#8217;s up. I&#8217;m here to relieve you.&#8221; The man said, glancing over at Trent and back at the guard.
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8217;Bout time, I was getting sick of this little pain in the ass. Want some Vodka? It&#8217;s Rheinlander.&#8221; The guard asked, trying to stand up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, just go. I need to have a little talk with our new friend here.&#8221; The new guard said, pointing at Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Eh, your loss.&#8221; The intoxicated guard managed to say, walking out of the room.
<br />
<br />The area was still too dimly lit for Trent to make out the guard&#8217;s face. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mr. Trent, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to be coming with us. Our leader wants to have a word with you.&#8221; The new guard said, this one clearly sober.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Great, where are we going? Are we taking the scenic route?&#8221; He asked sarcastically, anxious to get out of the holding cell.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t tell you that. But this case isn&#8217;t looking too good for you right now, you&#8217;re facing life in a maximum-security prison, and I&#8217;ve got just the place for you, the most secure prison in the colonies. Only a handful of people even know it exists. Now, your ship is being prepared, we&#8217;ll be leaving in a few minutes.
<br />
<br />
<br />All Trent could do was just sit there. Part of the nauseous feeling was shock, another was disbelief. He was about to be transported to a super-max prison; one that the guard said was the most secure in all of Sirius. 
<br />
<br />
<br />The man sat down in the chair and fell asleep, while Trent laid back on the bed in his cell, trying to make since of it all.
<br />
<br />Ten minutes later there was a knock on the door, and another guard stepped in.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re ready. The ship&#8217;s waiting downstairs.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alright Mr. Trent, lets go.&#8221; The guard said, standing up. They both walked over to Trent&#8217;s cell and opened the glass door, leaving the titanium bars closed.
<br />
<br />This was it, Trent thought. As soon as they let up those bars, I&#8217;m going to bolt for it.
<br />
<br />Trent noticed the guard that had been in the room with him for a few minutes wink at him. Trent noticed this and decided not to run, knowing they would probably shoot him if he did. Or, at least one of them, Trent thought suspiciously. 
<br />
<br />The bars were raised and the two guards walked into the cell and put his hands behind his back. They slipped the handcuffs on and walked Trent over to the door leading into the hall.
<br />
<br />As they stepped out into the corridor, the brilliant light blinded Trent. He had gotten so used to the dim blue light in the room coming from the TV that his eyes just weren&#8217;t ready to go out into the hall.
<br />
<br />They walked down the hallway to an elevator at the end. One of the guards hit the button, the doors opened and they all walked onto the elevator.
<br />
<br />They emerged in a loading deck full of convoys and armored transports. Trent was ushered onto the nearest transport and thrown into another holding cell.
<br />
<br />The ship lifted off the ground and flew out of the decks. Now, looking out the window, Trent could see where he was. There was snow on the roofs of buildings, and more was falling. He guessed he was on one of the mountains that were along the horizon, and this was confirmed as the ship picked up altitude.
<br />
<br />It waited in queue for the Docking Ring and, when its turn came, jetted off to space. 
<br />
<br />Trent looked out of the window in his holding cell. Off in the distance he could see Newark station, and he wondered if Juni was still there.
<br />
<br />Trent could see that five Defenders and three Patriots were joining them. Probably just escorts, he though to himself. 
<br />
<br />The ship docked with the Tradelane to Fort Bush and when it emerged, docked with the other one to Norfolk Shipyard.
<br />
<br />After it arrived at Norfolk, instead of taking the Tradelane to the Texas Jumpgate like Trent had thought, it pointed itself off into space and punched the cruise engines. 
<br />
<br />Then it came to him, he looked out the window, but only saw space. He had to reposition          himself to see out the window, and he saw a Jumpgate off in the distance.
<br />
<br />He sat back down on the bench in his cell. Why were they taking him to Alaska? That was when he remembered about the prison station in Alaska. He tried to remember what it was called. 
<br />
<br />He remembered the name but thought the name of the place didn&#8217;t really even matter. He was probably going there for life, and not ever coming back out. He remembered what Orillion had said about &#8220;Their man getting him out of there.&#8221; He was supposed to be out of there over an hour ago.
<br />
<br />The ship arrived at the passage through the Zone 21 minefield and sped through.
<br />
<br />When they came out in the clearing in the middle of the minefield where the Jumpgate and the Weapon Platform were, the ship cruised up to the Jumpgate and engaged docking procedure. The ship was now on its way to Alaska, and Trent knew, once he came in, he wasn&#8217;t coming out.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry if it seems a little, forgetable. I am probably going to be doing yard work for the rest of the day so I was in a little rush to get it up. I will try to make future chapters better. Again, all comments are welcome.

			<div class="content">Glad to see everyone is enjoying it. But I will warn you now, I love to put suspence in my stories, so be expecting it a lot. 
<br />
<br />
<br />And I'm glad to see that you guys finally think my story is up there with Bret's and Neuromancer's (BTW, there is no &quot;P&quot; in Neuromancer). But next week I will have to start going back to school again so I will hurry and try to get at least two more parts up before I have to go. Because once I'm back in school with homework and exausting days, I may only be able to put one chapter up each week. I hope that will not be the case, but it may be.
<br />
<br />And does anyone know what ever happened to Neuro? I havn't heard from him in about, woh, three or four months.</div>
