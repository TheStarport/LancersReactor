			<div class="content">The text pasted in like that from word (better medium for typing), and I don't know if there's any way to preserve format when pasting here.
<br />
<br />Also, for all of you who critique, how can you have one-line criticisms about my paragraphs?  That puzzles me.  While we're on this subject, think about a paragraph, and every time you quoted something, how would it look if you started on a new line??  I can see for dialogue, but not for witticism and remarks.
<br />
<br />If I started each quote with a new paragraph, it would look something like this:
<br />
<br />...Channel your
<br />
<br />     &quot;Inner Trent&quot;
<br />
<br />That doesn't please the eye as much as keeping it all on one line, but I agree that it would apply to dialogue.
<br />      Now, about the double-spacing issue, I am a strict opponent of it(sarcasm), and see no need to use it (more sarcasm).  In truth, I just don't like to double-space, it is the sign of rough drafts, and as such unappealing.
<br />
<br />But in the end, after all the arguing and accusations, it all comes down to this...
<br />
<br />Where are your positive criticisms of the story??
<br />
<br />To be able to criticise with any effect, you must have a place on which to stand when the eye looks back at you.  Don't shoot down my encouragement if you like the story, you discourage the author as killing that which complements is the same as saying it sucks.  So, it looks like you dislike the story, so what are you still doing here?? And if you hate this story with so much passion, then come outright and reveal its flaws, pull it apart with great satisfaction, but don't try to do it subtly, it makes you out to be cowards, are you??  After all, would you assasinate someone with a twig??
<br />
<br />To the dissidents:
<br />Shut up, sit down, and enjoy!
<br />
<br />Or else, get out.
<br />
<br />To the author:
<br />
<br />Keep up the good work, and pay no mind to those who are incapable of enjoying your work.  Today, dissident=fool, and don't forget it.</div>

<br />
<br />Chapter 5
<br />
<br />BATTLESHIP OSIRIS, SIGMA-13 SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	Silence permeated the room. It was King who finally broke it.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Um, excuse me, but could you say that again?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion smiled. &quot;I thought that would get your attention. Apparently, 
<br />
<br />cardamine is a deadly poison to the Nomads. They won't come through the jump hole 
<br />
<br />into Omicron Alpha because the cardamine buried with the Outcast derelicts repels 
<br />
<br />them. It's kind of like the old mythological belief that garlic repelled 
<br />
<br />vampires. Well, I believe that we have found our garlic for the vampires, as it 
<br />
<br />were.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We intend to figure out a way we can turn cardamine into an offensive 
<br />
<br />weapon. Doing so will inevitably turn the tide in our conflict with the Nomads. 
<br />
<br />That is all the information I can provide at this point. Any questions?&quot;
<br />
<br />	The room was still silent.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very well. Dismissed. Trent, King, would you please stay?&quot;
<br />
<br />	The room emptied, leaving Orillion, Chavez, Trent and King.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Gentlemen, we have to move quickly on this. We need to get cardamine 
<br />
<br />samples here to study. Trent, I will leave that in your hands.&quot; Trent nodded.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What?&quot; King said, a little surprised.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'll explain later.&quot; Trent said. Looks like the gig was up, he thought 
<br />
<br />to himself.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good. Meet me in the hangar in one hour. Secondly,&quot; Orillion continued, 
<br />
<br />&quot;we need to find Colonel Zane. Trent, do you have any idea where she is?&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent winced. &quot;No, she left the LSF and went to Kusari six months ago. I 
<br />
<br />haven't seen her since.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hmm, that's an odd move for her. I will contact Lord Hakkera and see if 
<br />
<br />he can locate her. King, I want you to fly to Kusari and meet Hakkera. See if you 
<br />
<br />can help him find Jun'ko. I'm going to take Mr. Chavez down to meet our 
<br />
<br />scientists and brief them. That's all, gentlemen.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent and King left the room.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So, what's with you and the cardamine? You're not a junkie, are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, I just have...connections.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You know, I'm getting kinda tired of hearing about your 'connections'. 
<br />
<br />No more bull, Trent. What are you really doing?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Look, King, it's better if I keep it under wraps for awhile.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, are you a criminal?&quot; King asked bluntly.
<br />
<br />	Trent exhaled slowly. Well, might as well tell him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sometimes.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The two men looked at each other in an uncomfortable silence.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sometimes? What the hell does that mean?&quot; King asked testily.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What is this, an interrogation?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I want to know what it is you're not telling me. You're hiding 
<br />
<br />something. And if you don't tell me I'll take it up with Orillion. We need to 
<br />
<br />have people we can trust here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent finally snapped. &quot;You do that, King, because he already knows. You 
<br />
<br />want the truth? I'm Carter Logan! I've worked for the Liberty Rogues, the 
<br />
<br />Corsairs, the Outcasts, and a lot of others. You want me to go on?&quot;
<br />
<br />	King stared at trent with a menacing look in his eyes.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Damn, you think you know someone.&quot; King turned and walked away.
<br />
<br />	-----------------
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, I want you to take this ship with you on your run.&quot; Orillion had 
<br />
<br />met Trent in the hanger and led him over to a Border Worlds Sabre. Trent looked 
<br />
<br />and liked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I can live with that. But why?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's better you go incognito rather than as Edison Trent in one of my 
<br />
<br />Anubises. You think you can dust off Carter Logan again?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Do I have a choice? Besides, I think everyone here knows now,&quot; Trent 
<br />
<br />said, shooting a dirty look at King on the other side of the hangar. Orillion saw 
<br />
<br />the look and the man it was directed at.
<br />
<br />	&quot;King knows?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, I know you and King are friends, and I'm sorry that I had to put 
<br />
<br />you in such an awkward position. I felt that we could benefit from some criminal 
<br />
<br />perspective, and a freelancer like you seemed the best way to do that.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It doesn't matter now. I've got to get moving.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What's your plan&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Probably Ruiz Base. It's not too far from here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good. Trent, it is vitally important that we get the cardamine, but it 
<br />
<br />is even more important that you use your contacts to get in good with the 
<br />
<br />Outcasts. We may need a lot more cardamine in the future, and they will probably 
<br />
<br />deal much better with a group of so-called terrorists than anyone else.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Terrorists?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, no one in the colonies except for us and President Jacobi know 
<br />
<br />anything about the Nomad incident. The Order is still considered a criminal 
<br />
<br />organization in the Houses. That may work to our advantage.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I got it. I better get going. See you later.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good luck.&quot;

			<div class="content">Here is Chapter 6. It's kinda short, but what the hell.
<br />
<br />
<br />Chapter 6
<br />
<br />RUIZ BASE, OMICRON BETA SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	&quot;Roger, Mr. Logan. You are cleared for docking. Welcome back.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Thank you, Ruiz Base. Out.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent eased his Sabre into the docking portal, now convinced he would have to convince Orillion into letting him have this ship. It had performed flawlessly, easily handling a Corsair surprise attack in Sigma-19. And, being the top-of-the-line ship of the Outcasts, that certainly couldn't hurt, either.
<br />
<br />	-------
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ahh, Mr. Logan! What a surprise! It's been a long time!&quot; Commodity Exchange Manager Pedro Gallardo exclaimed as Trent walked into the exchange.
<br />
<br />	&quot;How have you been, Pedro?&quot; Trent asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ahh, business has been a little slow as of late. Don't know why. Must be just one of those things.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, maybe I can help change your fortunes a little bit. I happen to be working for an individual who's looking to establish a route for trafficking cardamine, and I recommended you. He would like to have a sample before he makes an offer, however, and I am the courier. If you please, I need a hold full of your best stuff.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Anything for my kind of scum. I'll have it loaded for you within the hour.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Fine. I'll transfer the payment then.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh, by the way, Mr. Logan. If you're interested in making some serious credits, there is a two-million-credit bounty on the head of one Ernesto Chavez. He's a traitorous bastard that has apparently sold the Outcast's most inner secrets to the highest bidder. If anyone can terminate him, it would be you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent smiled. If only you knew, you Outcast weenie. &quot;I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip. You can contact me in the bar when you're ready to settle up.&quot; Trent turned around and headed for the bar. Suddenly his neural net silent alarm went off. He walked to a dark corner of the bar and activated it.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, it's Juni.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent's jaw dropped. &quot;Juni? Where the hell have you been?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, I can't talk for long. I need to speak with you in person. Meet me on Ogashawa in Sigma-19. And don't tell anyone else. Please.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Juni, what the hell is going on?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I have to go. Just meet me on Ogashawa and I'll explain. Juni out.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent turned off his neural net. What was that all about? he wondered. His neural net alarm for Carter Logan chimed.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Mr Logan, your cargo is ready.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Ah, thank you. I'm now transferring payment. Thanks Pedro. See you soon.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good luck my friend.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent made his way to the hangar, wondering what he should do. Ogashawa was on the way back to the Osiris; should he stop and see what was up with Juni?
<br />
<br />	He launched his Sabre into space and decided that he needed to deliver the cardamine first. Orillion needed to hear about this.
<br />

<br />Chapter 7
<br />
<br />BATTLESHIP OSIRIS, SIGMA-13 SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	&quot;And she didn't say anything else?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No,&quot; Trent said. &quot;She said she wanted to speak to me and me only. Has Lord Hakkera said anything about her?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No,&quot; replied Orillion, &quot;you're the only contact we've had with her. Something doesn't seem right.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;She sounded downright freaked about something to me. There's something strange about all this.  I don't speak with her for six months, and all the sudden she calls me. I think she's in trouble.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;That's not behavior I would expect from Jun'ko. I think you may be right. What are your thoughts?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;If she's in trouble, we have to get her out of there. We owe that to her. I think I should go. Alone.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion was silent for a moment. &quot;My instincts are against it, Trent. However, she seems to have a lot of trust in you, or else she wouldn't have contacted you first. All right, go to Ogashawa and find out what's going on. Be careful out there. If there's trouble, I want you out of there. Understood?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Got it. I'm going to take the Sabre again. It's best if I do this as incognito as possible.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very well. Get going.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />-----------------
<br />
<br />GAS MINER OGASHAWA, SIGMA-19 SYSTEM
<br />
<br />	Trent walked into the bar and looked around. There was no sign of Juni anywhere, and Trent didn't want to ask around fo fear that it may cause suspicion. He sat down and asked the bartender if he had a Side4winder Fang. Surprisingly enough, he did.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Excuse me, are you Trent?&quot; said a man behind him.
<br />
<br />	Trent turned around to face the man. &quot;Maybe. Why?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I was asked by a Jun'ko Zane to relay a message to a Mr. Trent. You match the description she gave.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm Trent. What's the message?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;She would like to meet you on C-deck, at the equipment dealer. That is all she said.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hmm. Thanks.&quot; Trent got up and turned to walk away. The man watched him for a moment, and followed him out.
<br />
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />	Trent entered the equipment dealer shop and looked around.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent? Is that you?&quot; a familiar voice said.
<br />
<br />	Trent turned and saw Jun'ko Zane standing by a rack of ship cannons. He noticed that the rack was out of the view of most of the shop. Trent walked over and looked at her.
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's been a long time. How are you?&quot;
<br />	
<br />	&quot;I'm fine. Were you followed?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't think so. Now what the hell is going on?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We shouldn't talk here. Come on.&quot; Juni led him out of the equipment dealer toward a small storage room. She shut the door behind them.
<br />
<br />	&quot;All right, Juni. Now what is going on?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, I wanted to tell you that you and the Order are in grave danger. The Nomads know that you have the knowledge that may destroy them, and they are preparing to invade Sirius and render it desolate before you can use it against them. We won't be able to stop them this time.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Juni, how do you know this?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I have my sources.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent was starting to feel a little uncomfortable. There was something slightly unsettling to all this.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Why didn't you tell Orillion this. Why tell this to me?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Because I knew that if I contacted you, you would come without hesitation. After all, you still have feelings for me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent looked down at the ground, not sure what to say.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You humans are so predictable,&quot; Juni said.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What?&quot; Trent looked up to find Jun'ko Zane pointing a gun at him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Whoa, Juni. What the hell are you doing?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Taking advantage of an opportunity. What better way to destroy the Order, the one obstacle standing between us and domination of Sirius than to send back their top agent as one of us?&quot; Juni walked toward him. Her eyes suddenly glowed with bright blue light.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good God, you're a Nomad!&quot; Trent exclaimed.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very good, Mr. Trent. Now, Prepare to be enlightened. The pain will only last a moment.&quot; Juni walked toward him with eyes blazing with dazzling blue light as Trent backed up with nowhere else to go.
<br />
<br />	Suddenly a loud blast rocked the room as the door was blown from its hinges. Instinctively Trent threw himself to the floor. He heard several shots, then silence. He picked himself off the floor and saw Juni on the ground. King and the man who had delivered the message in the bar were standing in the doorway. King held a stun pistol.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Come on,&quot; King said, &quot;we need to get her into stasis fast! You okay, Trent?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm fine.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Good. Let's get out of here!&quot;
<br />
<br />	
<br />
