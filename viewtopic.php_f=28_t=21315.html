<br />
<br />Special thanks to all at The Lancers Reactor &amp; Kurgan for sending me some great models.
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lancersreactor.com">http://www.lancersreactor.com</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Kurgan now has his own mod out called Kurgans Shipyards. Be sure to check it out.
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT:
<br />
<br />Other mod makers may use any part of Hostile Universe except of the Systems and Bases. Those are HU only files I want to keep because they make my mod look and feel different from everybody elses. I was going to abandon Mod manager support this version in order to put this release into a patch that would make the systems harder to steal. However I have deviced not to in this version. 
<br />
<br />Introduction.
<br />
<br />Hostile Universe is not just a mod, its an Adventure. Always wanted to say that <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />The mod was made to encourage the player to explore the Universe without the mod maker having to explain everything or give the location of all the goodies. It is a mod for players who like to find things for them selves and do not like the quick and easy approach other mods take down the road of instant satisfaction. Everything added to the game in this mod is ballanced against all other parts of the game so you will not find super ships or super weapons here. Hostile Universe is putting back some of the best elements of the single player campaign plus some new stuff you have not see yet. The idea to make playing Freelancer an Adventure after you have completed the campaign. 
<br />
<br />Freelancer FLPatch compatibility.
<br />
<br />Hostile Universe Does not support the Freelancer 1.1 patch. I found the patch places too many restrictions on what I can mod so I have abandoned supporting it completely. The devs only recommended it for people who have problems connecting to servers anyway so it should not be in general use. 
<br />
<br />Installation.
<br />
<br />Please read the player guide and faq before installing Hostile Universe.
<br /><a href='http://www.respawn.co.uk/invboard/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=13&amp;t=831&amp;s=1c403ab61388ce9f2f23557a9abae87e' Target=_Blank>Hostile Universe Forums</a>
<br />
<br />Hostile Universe expects to be installed into a mod managers Mods folder and thus is setup to create a folder called Hostile universe when installed so it will work with both FLMM and Flauncher mod managers. If you do not use a mod manager then you must extract this mod into a temp folder and copy the data and exe folders in the Hostile universe folder across to your freelancer directory so they overwrite the files in there. Using the Mouse Right click + Drag and drop usually works best when copying folders. 
<br />
<br />I have included a complete list of files that I have modified at the bottom of this document. I strongly advise you to backup the original files before you overwrite any files either by launching the mod via a mod manager or by the drag and drop method.
<br />
<br />Please note that in order to support both Flauncher and FLMM I have not used the FLMM file extension. 
<br />
<br />Fixes and changes.
<br />
<br />Fixed the random crashes that started appearing in version 7 in systems that where not modded. 
<br />Fixed several minor problems including the Hessians using Starfurys.
<br />Changed the way the research commodity works so they now take up more space in the hold. Thus preventing players from buying thousands of them whilst in any ship. 
<br />

<br />News and Rumours
<br />
<br />Universe wide News and Rumours to give hints at features added in Hostile Universe. 
<br />
<br />Renamed Factions.
<br />
<br />Libery Factions have been renamed to Earth Force Factions &amp; HomeGuard Factions.
<br />
<br />Prices.
<br />
<br />Prices increased by atleast 300% for weapons, equipement and ships.
<br />
<br />Commodity Features.
<br />
<br />All commodities now take up space. So you will no longer be able to get 40 units of a commodity in a cargo hold listed as being able to hold 40 units. The exact amount you can carry depends greatly on the commodity your buying. Some ships simply will not have the required cargo space to carry some commodities now.   
<br />
<br />Local Noobee commodities.
<br />Water
<br />Oxygen
<br />Food
<br />
<br />Local Commodities are common in all systems and can be brought at all planets and sold for a profit at most if not all Space Station. 
<br /> 
<br />New Cargos.
<br />Passengers
<br />Prisoners
<br />Wanted Man.
<br />
<br />Notes on the wanted man.
<br />You can sell to (turn him in) at any battleship for a fraction of the price you would have gotten if you took him to a pirate base that he wanted to go to. If you take him to Malta or Crete you will get a huge reward. However you can only carry 1 wanted man at a time. 
<br />
<br />New Ship Equipement Available to Buy.
<br />
<br />Ships can now be upgraded with carious equipement including a brand new Electronic Jammer that fits in to the counter measure slot and several upgrades to existing equipement. Other upgrades include, scanners, power plants, tractor beams, thrusters and a few others. 
<br />
<br />Plus a few thousand other changes. 
<br />
<br />To many to list.
<br />   
<br />Known Issues
<br />
<br />The game crashes when plotting the best route through NewYork. I am looking into this. All other best routes that do not pass through Newyork work fine.
<br />
<br />The Hyperspace gate sometimes keeps the player waiting to dock, returning to freeflight and moving closer to the gate before hitting dock again usually works.

			<div class="content">Bug Update.
<br />
<br />I have checked out several bug reports raging from ship destroy missions crashing, Ejected life pods crashing when tractored in to missions second way points and the thunderbolt load out. 
<br />
<br />After much testing I have found only the Thunderbolt issue was replicatable on my system. The other bugs people reported just dont happen here. 
<br />
<br />I recommend trying Hu from a clean install and seeing if that fixes your problems. No need to remove your saved games but dont use an HU save on any other mod. HU's moving in direction that will cause you lots of problems if you try using the HU save on other mods.
