			<div class="content">First time poster here been reading these fourms for quite a bit and thought i'd post some of my thoughts here. One thing I have noticed in this game is the fact that in the higher level systems you see ships that are only able to hold a certian class level for weapons or missile types etc. I was in a system where I scaned a defender. When I looked at the description it said max class level 4 only thing was his weapons where level 8 class. This brought to mind an idea I had if  there where some way to make it so that all ships could use level 10 items it would prevent people from all riding around in the same high end ships and give more usefulness to the lesser low level ships. But you say they have low armor and crappy cargo space maybe if some one made a mod of some type or maybe later on with a patch or such that there would be some way to pay a large sum of money to upgrade armor,cargo space weapon mounts etc. I hear people talk about having a load of money and not begining able to do nothing with it well why not upgrade your ship of choice. I also would base a limit  on how much of what you could add like if it where a fighter class you wouldn't be able to have a massive amount of cargo space but you would be able to get a lot of placement mounts not a crazy amount like an extra 3 or 4. 
<br />
<br />      Now with faction I had an idea its mostly for MP I don't know if this was every talked about. I was thinking that if there where a way when you started a MP game you could pick a faction to work under like when you start I noticed you started as navy. I think it would be cool if you could pick a system it would give ya a list of the current faction with in it and you could select one it would start you off with that systems lowest ship and 2k credits. Or another option if you got really good with a faction they would allow you to join them and in joining you could get some kind of bonus of some kind. If you were also allied with some kind of faction them and there allies would always help you if they where nearby instead of just kind of roaming by and not doing nothing.
<br />
<br />Anyways just some thoughts I mean I love the game thought I'd share some of my ideas with this forum.
