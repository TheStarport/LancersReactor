			<div class="content">&gt;Call it what ever you want, it's still an illegal copy and it is technically flawed.
<br />
<br />No.
<br />It is being legally sold, with a valid license.
<br />You cant, as a company, just pirate a game, then sell it without the license of the initial publisher. Where do you live please?
<br />
<br />Additionally, what technical issues???
<br />The 3D sound problem has nothing to do with this. I dont know of any other &quot;major&quot; technical issues with FL.
<br />A lot of players in our community are playing with Ubisoft Exclusive / Software Pyramide copies and have no issues at all.
<br />
<br />So, wtf are you talking about?
<br />And how do you know all that stuff you are claiming? In another topic I asked you to give some sources for your &quot;exclusive&quot; information (ie. they pirated the game and sell it under their own name). 
<br />
<br />This is a cover of the ubisoft game: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51667ME9F0L._SS500_.jpg">http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/5 ... SS500_.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />You can clearly see the Microsoft Game Studios logo.
<br />Software Pyramide is selling this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51f5yaTYvBL._SS400_.jpg">http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/5 ... SS400_.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />I have heard they are also using a fixed exe, but they also have the Microsoft Game Studios logo.
<br />
<br />Apart from that, there has been a pirated copy of FL in the warez scene from day one. The crack is from 2003.
<br />And as those no-cd copies only get selled since they are &quot;budget&quot; anyways (2005 or 2006?), I can see no reason how this could have made *any* damage to Microsoft or &quot;us&quot;.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p427752" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Honestly, all you need to do is take a look at all the technical problems that's cropped up from mod developments and game play using it. Between that and the Official version, there have been numerous issues that have resulted in file corruption, CTD's and server crashes. You'll find them all over this site.
<br />The two versions of this are just not completely compatable. That should be pretty obvious.
<br />There is  no point in asking everyone who has or uses it to simply &quot;raise their hands&quot; . Really, they're too numerous now. I don't fault anyone for wanting to play the game, nor fault them for trying to get their own copy of Freelancer.
<br />It's just that those who didn't realize what they were getting, didn't know what would actually come out of it. A basket load of problems.
<br />At this point in time, there probably isn't going to be any retribution toward those who have basically messed themselves up and compounded an already difficult modding situation. (Sort of like MS taunting at us; &quot;see what you get&quot;?  &quot;Give you enough rope and you'll hang yourselves&quot; )
<br />
<br />All I'm saying is that the &quot;unofficial&quot; version has been a continuing source of headaches. Not very much we can do about it except try to &quot;Fix&quot; those problems as they crop up now. Okay, so even if this Ubisoft has managed to aquire liscensing rights, that does not mean they got their hands on the code. We're still dealing with a lot of problems.
<br />Okay, so if someone came out with an Exe fix...who was it and what did that accomplish? It still isn't the original exe. (It still doesn't mean they got their hands on the code either, which btw is something many of us have been begging MS for) But, why would MS even bother assisting anyone who in the begining cracked the CD? (which wasn't a good &quot;crack&quot; anyway)
<br />
<br />(Uhm, excuse me...I just cracked your CD which I hate your company anyway, but I'm having some problems with it now and I want the code)
<br />
<br />OH, COME ON! Why would MS bother to help arrogant stupidity?
<br />
<br />
<br />Simply because someone can &quot;hack&quot; or &quot;crack&quot; a CD doesn't mean it's going to produce an identical copy. Still hasn't happened yet.  If you want a &quot;Real&quot; copy, you have to have the code and MS isn't going to part with it faik.</div>

			<div class="content">Blimey.
<br />From what I understood, copy protection is due to publishers, not developers - so they wouldn't require a &quot;crack&quot; to do it. Furthermore, they probably got it without any copy protection, NOT that they got it - cracked it, and then printed the CD's.
<br />
<br />Maybe it's got the 1.1 patch on it, simply get someone to check their files and tell you what version some of their dll files are... maybe that's causing your issues? Not some mysterious hack or evil doings <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Personally, not seen or heard of any beyond &quot;Oh no, i need cd after activating this mod, but the cd is in the drive already!&quot;, other than that never heard of any issues... i would expect most issues will come from exe or dll editing mods though - instead of just ini file tweaks.</div>
