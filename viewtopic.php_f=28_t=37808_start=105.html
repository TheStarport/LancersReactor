			<div class="content">Hello, Black Eagle and Dreyus. Thanks for the detailed replies.
<br />Dreyus: I&#8217;m a single player. So some shortcoming of the mod in my mind may not be your most concern. I can fully understand that. 
<br />I saw Black Eagle put Lord Tekogo into the ship shop of the nomad outpost so I suggested that Juni and other NPCs should also be put into the new bases created by Black Eagle so that it seems the story is going on. Since shipdealer and trader in bases need no voice, I thought it would not be much work. Well, maybe I was wrong.
<br />
<br />About the robots' voice I remember Black Eagle&#8217;s explanation. But I still think machine voice would be cooler. I once met some robots in Rheinland bars, they talk every thing like other human NPCs, except for the machine voice, so I think there IS a machine voice in bar. As in air, I also heard some machine talk when I was docking on some planets. The only part I&#8217;m not sure is if there exists a machine voice for mission consignors.
<br />
<br />The flyable battleships and stolen Liberty cruisers and Mystere are OK, I can live with that<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I know it&#8217;s important to meet different tastes as a multi-playable mod, although I&#8217;m only play single mode.
<br />
<br />And here is a little bug I found in robot 1 system: the bartender and trader of ROS (rob01_04_base) seem to have no hands.
<br />
<br />A little more advice: the explosion effect of nomad torpedo is too dazzling, which is not good for both computer screen and our eyes.</div>

			<div class="content">Hi again!
<br />
<br />Dreyus: Thanks for the post. It explains very well many of my ideas and was in my opinion really helpful for me and for Powerdoll. Thanks for that, Dreyus. (And sorry that I had to quit so fast last time on the Void, but I needed to help Strail with the bugs in the Void and had to do MUCH homework. I hope we will meet again there soon)
<br />
<br />Powerdoll:
<br />
<br />I also played SP only for a long time and therefore can understand many of your points. As I said I will try to add some of the story characters as soon as possible, as this is in my opinion a very good idea and improves the atmosphere in the game (hope this word is right in english <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />About the robot voices. Until now I did not have a second look for them, but I have to say the following.
<br />If you only heard robot voices in bars and during planet landing, it will probably not be possible to add them in space, as they are not there.
<br />Voices for planet landing and in bars are different ones than the ones used in space for pilots or something else. I already have robot voices for the landing sequences on Robot sattions and planets and a robot voice for the bartender. But I'm quite sure that there are no robot voices for the following things:
<br />
<br />pilots, people in the bar except of the bartender and mission consigners.
<br />
<br />The only robot voices that are definitely in the game (I found these already) are:
<br />
<br />bartenders and landing people (e.g.: you are clear to dock).
<br />
<br />I will look for others, but I will probably not find any and making new sounds is impossible for me.
<br />
<br />For the bug with the robot bartender: You are right, thanks for the advice. I already know how to fix this and will do this in the patch.
<br />
<br />The explosion of the Nomad torpedo is really not very good for the computer. But as this weapons and the explosion is quite strange like all the Nomad stuff, I think I cannot change this without crashing the game (Changing Nomad stuff is a big problem for all modders until now). So, this will stay in the mod.
<br />
<br />See you around guys!
<br />
<br />Black Eagle</div>

			<div class="content">Hi kevins and thanks!
<br />
<br />As you seem to know about ini editing this should be easy for you (I also think that it is quite hard and I can only stand against the Nomads. Monkeys and Robots are too hard for me, but I think the players like ti and it is good to have some really hard NPCs in the mod. Also for very good players. This is why I made them so strong).
<br />
<br />Now to turn it of:
<br />
<br />Go to the pilots_population again. Then look at every pilot for &quot;repair_id =repair_fighter_both&quot; or similar.
<br />
<br />The pilots you want to prevent using nanobots, change to &quot;repair_id = repair_fighter_never&quot; and they will not use Nanobots again.
<br />
<br />You can change every pilot, or just some of then (e.g.: monkeys and Robots) like you want.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps and have fun with the mod!

			<div class="content">Powerdoll, I appreciate SP a lot as well, I just started multiplayer recently, my first server. It's just that the major component's of a mod such as game balance and new things are of a higher priority (in my mind at least,) than minor details. Like painting, you do the outline and the colours first then finish it off with final flourishes. 
<br />
<br />Another random question, are Nomad Rebuild Cell's usable by players? If so how, assuming I already had some? And they just act as standard nanobots right, Just more realistic for Nomads?</div>

			<div class="content">Hi Dreyus!
<br />
<br />The Nomad Rebuild Cells are just to have it more realistic. It looked a bit odd, when the Nomads still used Nanobots on their alien fighters. Therefore I created the Rebuild Cells.
<br />
<br />However they are not useable by players. You can loot them, but somehow the game does not show you a number, how many you have and sometimes uses all of them, giving you only the repair rate of one.
<br />I don't know what this is, but they just don't work and therefore I made them non-lootable, so that only the Nomad NPCs have access to them.
<br />
<br />Maybe I will work on them if I have some more time and already got some of the other things.</div>

			<div class="content">' THE ROBOTS ' Pt 3 By Vader{MERCS} , Based on the ' MONKEYS-MOD ' By BLACKEAGLE ( Monkey Mod Magic )
<br />
<br />In our last chapter, Vader , the bounty-hunter from the colonies of SIRIUS,was on the trail of the wanted criminal AZAR Diablo.Having left his Recon post to persue the deadly criminal, Vader has tracked him down to the system ' Omicron-Beta ' , and has found himself in a most deadly situation. Having encountered an unknown hostile vessell of incredible power, Vader soon realizes that he is in a heap of trouble as his ship is seriously crippled in the onsueing battle with the unknown vessell , and with the added re-appearance of AZAR, he is now not only facing one , but two deadly adversaries. Preparing to face his doom, Vader braces himself for impact as the deadly fighters close in for the kill...
<br /> 
<br />           &quot;May-day , May-day.This is Vader MERCS, can anyone here me !? &quot;.I fumble through the switches panicking amidst the sparks and optic-wire casing tubes which have come loose from my onboard computer.
<br />&quot;Missile Approaching &quot;.
<br /> &quot;S#$#, s#$# !! c'mon !!&quot; My heart drops to my stomach as i realize that my missile counter-measure dropper has been lost , and there is no way to stop the approaching war-head. Suddenly , a voice crackles on my comm.link. &quot;WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR !? .., GET OUTTA THERE !!&quot;.
<br />&quot; WHAT !? Who is this!? &quot; i reply.
<br />&quot;GET OUTTA THERE NOW !! &quot;. With no time to think about it, i press the eject-capsule switch.Within 1.5 seconds, my flight chair has become a cocoon of strengthened alloy.With my Transplex released from my cock-pit, my eject-capsule is then launched foward ,exiting my ship at tremendous speed by the powerful but shortlived nano-rockets encased in the outter-lining of the capsule.Spinning violently and in great pain, i can hear the Transplex and alloy smashing into the side of my capsule as i am shot into the void of open space.
<br />&quot;Aaarrghh&quot;. I let out a cry of pain as my head bangs the side of the capsule inner-lining. 
<br />&quot;HANG ON !! &quot;. I hear the unknown voice again, calling to me through my comm.link but i have no time to reply as i feel a strong electro-magnetic pulse surging through my capsule with a loud 'Buzzing 'sound dissabling all electrical components within the capsule. 
<br />' Huh !? ', i'm being tractor-beamed ! what the hells going on !? '.
<br />Suddenly i hear an explosion of immense proportion behind me , then a loud clanging noise as everything becomes muffled and i feel the capsule touch on solid surface.
<br />&quot;HURRY UP AND GET UP HERE !!&quot;.The same voice as before shouts a command , but it is a lot louder than before. ' Whats going on!? ', i think to myself as i manually release the structural clamps on my capsule.
<br />                                  
<br /> Bewildered and confused, i unholster my Nuetron-charge disrupter and draw my weapon as i hop out of the eject-capsule amidst steam and smoke coming from its protective outter-lining.Standing in the middle of what must be a ship cargo-bay, i look around for the entry-hatch when i suddenly feel the floor below me tip on a right angle sending me into the wall of the hull.
<br /> &quot;HURRY UP , I NEED YOU UP HERE !!&quot;.
<br />Bracing myself against the cargo-bay hull, i spot the entry hatch and make my way towards it. &quot;Whoever this is? the hatch is locked ! &quot;. A second later the hatch opens and i enter a small tunnell leading to what must be the cock-pit.
<br />         Clambering towards the hatch at the opposite end , i feel a terrible shift as i am thrown into the wall of the tunnell. Again ,i hear the voice ,&quot; WE'RE TAKING DAMAGE , HURRY UP !! &quot; .I shake off the blow and continue to make my way towards the end of the tunnell.
<br /> &quot;Open the hatch !! &quot; i cry as i draw my gun, still not knowing to whom i am talking to ,and then the hatch opens. &quot;AZAR !!&quot;
<br />
<br />Still seated , but with his gun drawn and pointing at me is 'AZAR'. With my gun also drawn and pointing at him , we look at each other for a breif second when suddenly the ship shudders again violently. BOOOOMMMM  !! As the ship shakes AZAR drops his gun but i manage to hold onto mine.BOOOOMMM !! ,another violent shake.At this point i realize we must be taking fire from the unknown vessell whom i first thought was a member of his faction,then in a desperate tone , AZAR  gestures to me , &quot; Please, we dont have time for this ! .. we gotta get outta here!..now !! &quot;. Letting my better judgement take the benefit of the doubt, i put aside my original mission objectives and lower my gun .
<br /> &quot;Thank you.. , now please.. , you must man the turret !! &quot; 
<br />
<br />                           To be cont ....</div>

			<div class="content">Hey Vader!
<br />
<br />Cool story. Now aligned with Azar fighting, what I think is a Nomad Mystere! I love it. One thing: Maybe I just did not see it, but, which ship were you flying at the beginning of the story? A Hammerhead?
<br />
<br />I am currently working on a mod called Monkey Universe for gestoord. It is the Monkeys with some additions for MP (look on page 5 of this thread, were gestoord posted some information). When I'm finished, I will go on with the Monkeys (I can even use some of the additions of Monkey Universe: e.g.: a new Order system I made).
<br />Vader, I thought about adding some of the guys from this thread here (and also from the old thread) on a new hidden base and also in space. Would it be ok, if you were a Bounty Hunter telling your fan fiction as rumors?
<br />I think this would be a nice addition.
<br />
<br />That's it for now!
<br />

			<div class="content">Hey,I have a idea for the mod.A HF thats as fast as a LF.Oh and it costs alot of money,about 3x as much as the anubas mk2.It also must be powerful,about as strong as the anubas mk2.Still its only a idea.Mabey Consors may enter the lower unknown(for curiosoty,but they dont go in very far.).Of corse these are only ideas,and there ok ideas.And id like Nomads in Valkeys(looks like theyve taken over rinlanders).and i think the nomads need a faster LF.to mach the discovry in speed.But it cant suvive strong attacks(like the discovry).And i think the nomads need a LF,like that fighting orientated light fighter you were talking about before.But these are only ideas(Im not a modder).i hope you like them.</div>

			<div class="content">BLACK EAGLE,
<br />                    Hi this is Vader{MERCS}, how are you? , i am most pleased you like the 3rd bit ,but for myself, i was not that happy with it, the next chapter is the one!!( In the 4th chapter is where i really define the different aspects of the 'MONKEYS' mod in relation to the original ' Freelancer ' Storyline/theme once the storyline missions are complete, for this i spend time reading all the rumours/ bulletins that i can find relating to the 'MONKEYS' and 'ROBOTS' origins ) .
<br />In answer to your question ,i would be HONOURED to have the f.f. included,but please, could you wait till the 4th chapter to see if you like it? and still want to do that? 
<br />
<br />      This is still the best ' Single player ' addition by far!,Vader{MERCS}</div>

			<div class="content">Hi guys!
<br />
<br />Sorry that I were not around for some time, but I had many things to do during the last days.
<br />As you may know, I'm currently working on a slightly different version of my mod for the Monkey Universe Server. I'm now almost finished with this and then can go back to the Monkeys again. The cool thing is that I can use some of the additions from this mod. For example I made a new system for the Order and one for the Nomads, which I can use in the next version of the Monkeys. If you want to see them, just download the Monkey Universe Mod (should be available by the end of the week on the site of SFG. The link is some posts above) and go to the Edinburgh system. From there you can reach the new systems.
<br />
<br />Now for your posts:
<br />
<br />Denstar: The idea of a strong HF is quite good, although I already had a similar idea, but thought about a LF. This would be a fast and maneuverable ship for high level players, which could stand against VHFs in this fighter (Of course only, if they used their maneuverability).
<br />Corsairs in Unknown two would be a nice addition. I already wrote in some infocards that they entered the system and therefore it would be good to have some encounters. Thanks for the good idea!
<br />A LF for the Nomads is already in works. I know that they need an LF and an assault freighter and I'm currently working on these.
<br />Many thanks for these ideas. I like them very much. Keep posting these and have fun playing the mod.
<br />
<br />Vader: I don't know why you did not like the 3rd chapter. I though the things were getting really interesting now. But as you said the fourth chapter is even better, I will wait for this.
<br />As I will still need some time to release the patch to version 1.2 of the Monkeys, you will also have plenty of time for the 4th chapter. I will just add the story as last thing to get as much chapters in it as possible.
<br />It's good to hear that you still like my mod so much. Without you and your good ideas the current mod would not be as good as it is. I will try to get the patch ready as soon as possible so that you have some new things to explore soon! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Keep playing, posting and writing <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Hi!
<br />
<br />Denstar: I would really like to get more ideas, if you have some others. But one question: what do you mean with the level 10 guns not working in MP. Did you test it? and if so, which guns did not make damage to players?
<br />There are already some servers using my mod and normally all the weapons are okay, also in MP against players. The only weapon not working against players is the Nomad torpedo, but this is already fixed for the next version.
<br />So, what did you mean with this (If you are right I have to fix it).
<br />
<br />Thanks for posting!
<br />
<br />Vader: How are you? If you want to see two systems from the next version, visit the Monkey Universe Server during the next week. The mod will be up at the beginning of the next week.
<br />Have fun! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Hi, Black Eagle.
<br />I'm looking forward to the Monkey Univers Mod, too.
<br />Is there any problem if I use the save file of  Monkey1.18 to continue playing in Monkey Univers Mod? Cause  I don't want to start from manhattan with $800 again if I don't have to. 
<br />I've collect all the wrecks of robert system and owned an Anubis with nomad torpedo. Some of the wrecks are extremely dangerous to get, sometimes I had to cruise interruptor to hit the wreck because other weapons were out of attacking range, and if I went a little nearer towards it, I would be a dead man, and if I hasitated a little when the cargos appeared, the cargos would explode and I got nothing. They are really the most skill-demanding wreck exploring in the game. Of course, the cargos picked are worth the risk. Since I worked for the Order and Monkey, it 's impossible for me to buy nomad weapons from their outpost. So the wreck was the only place where I could find my nomad torpedo.</div>
