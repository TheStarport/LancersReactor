<br />IMPORTANT: This mod is not out yet. The alpha relase will be out in about a week, and the actual mod in about 3 months. But since most of the mod is RP based, if you want to fly capital ships you have to apply for a faction on the forum now.
<br />
<br />Note: Only Empire, Rebels and Black Sun will get capital ships. Black sun will not get many, and Empire and Rebels will get roughly the same number. (about 25 at the moment)
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT: I am not part of the mod team, but a high ranking member of the Empire. I can answer most of your questions though. Any other questions can be asked on <a href='http://swcivilwar.bebbet.nl' Target=_Blank>swcivilwar.bebbet.nl</a>. The head modder goes by the name of Dev.
<br />
<br />Note: On the Tides of War forums I go by the name Talon.
<br />
<br />
<br />The Star Wars: Tides of War mod is nearing alpha release! With the final ships being added and systems being designed, things are shaping up well for this brand new mod, which is sure to change the way mods are created for all time!
<br />Why will this mod be different from all other Star Wars mods out there, and EVERY Freelancer mod in general? Here are a few features of Star Wars: Tides of War:
<br />   CUSTOM HITBOXES! Thanks to Dev, our lead modder, All ships in the Tides of War mod will be TO SCALE: Thats right, 1600m ISDs, complete with hitbox, turrets, and they are FLYABLE! This will be the FIRST Freelancer mod to sport custom hitboxes in its FIRST release!
<br />   Thrusters removed, they didn't have thrusters in the Star Wars universe, just throttle.
<br />   Speaking of regular speeds, they have been increased to compensate for the lack of thrust.
<br />   No Cruise Engines, hyperspace lanes have been made throughout the systems for easily transit.
<br />   New custom background for systems, compliments of Dev! The universe appears more vast now, check the screenshots of the ISD (from bridge view) at the Tides of War forum.
<br />   Plenty of ships to choose from! With all ships being to scale, you can buy ships with size and cargo space in mind, not just firepower.
<br />   Did I mention CUSTOM HITBOXES?
<br />To find out the rest of the details concerning the mod, go to the Tides of War website at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.swtidesofwar.com">www.swtidesofwar.com</a><!-- w --> a link to the forum is provided there.

			<div class="content">Ships for the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance
<br />Ship Details Included 
<br /> 
<br /> Galactic Empire 
<br />
<br />
<br />::Capital Ships:: 
<br />
<br />
<br />Imperial Star Destroyer Mk. II (ISD2) - 1600 meters. Unmatched, the most powerful ship in the mod. Heavy turbolasers and ion cannons will make short work of all but perhaps an MC90, though enemy fighters at close range may prove difficult to shoot down. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Imperial Star Destroyer (ISD) - 1600 meters. A little weaker than an MC90, but still exceptionally powerful. Heavy turbolasers and ion cannons like the ISD2. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Victory Star Destroyer Mk. II (VSD2) - 900 meters. An uprated version of an old capital ship that is used to handle missions when an ISD is not available. Still a powerful ship in its own right and not to be taken lightly, the VSD2 can take on an MC80 without difficulty despite being smaller. Outfitted with heavy turbolasers and a moderate complement of ion cannons. As with the ISDs, fighters could prove problematic to handle alone. As a comparison, it would take about two and a half to three VSD2s to match an ISD. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Loronar Strike Cruiser - 450 meters. Easily produced, strike cruisers neatly fill the role of a small, fast capital ship that can engage and destroy enemy corvettes and transports. Though somewhat old, they don't date back as far as dreadnaughts or the original VSDs. With a large complement of turbolasers, the strike cruiser has a slight advantage over the dreadnaught in terms of raw firepower; in maneuverability it is far superior. Perhaps seven strike cruisers would match up to an ISD. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Dreadnaught - 600 meters. Very old ships, dreadnaughts are easily outclassed by more modern capital ships but can still hold their own in many situations. Commonly operated on the outer rim so that the more valuable ISDs can be deployed to vital regions. Armed with a moderate amount of heavy turbolasers and heavy laser turrets, making them somewhat of a threat to capships and fighters. However, they will not stand up to the mon cal cruisers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Nebulon-B Frigate - 300 meters. Packing suprising firepower for its size, the nebulon-B is not particularly agile but suitable for convoy defense against small capital ships and fighters alike. With numerous light turbolasers and laser turrets, this ship would only lose if badly outclassed. Even so, it would take well over 10 nebulon-Bs to match up to the might of a single ISD. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Carrack Light Cruiser - 350 meters. A jack-of-all-trades ship, the Carrack is quite fast and can engage smaller capital ships as well as enemy fighters with a very good chance of success, though heavy capships will eat them for breakfast. Armed with some turbolasers and many laser turrets. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Lancer Frigate - 250 meters. Built for the sole purpose of engaging starfighters, the Lancer mounts many fast-tracking laser turrets and is able to move about the battlefield rapidly. However, its lack of turbolasers makes it a prime target for enemy capships both large and small. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />::Fighters:: 
<br />
<br />
<br />TIE Defender - Hands down the best non-custom starfighter in the galaxy, the defender boasts four laser cannons and two ion cannons, as well as concussion missiles and/or proton torpedoes and thick shields. On top of this, they can outrun anything else in space and in truth should be able to outfly everything as well; however, this would just make them too dern good, plus it would take away from the glory of the interceptors (I am, naturally, quite biased in favor of the interceptor). Still, they are quite agile. All in all, not a ship you want to tangle with, especially if the pilot is good. 
<br />
<br />
<br />TIE Avenger - With four laser cannons and two missile/torp launchers as well as respectable shielding and great speed, the avenger may be weaker than the defender but is still more than adequate to take on the fighters of the Alliance. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Assault Gunboat - The assault gunboat is an interesting departure from the classic TIE philosophy of imperial fighter design. Mounting two laser cannons and two ion cannons, twin missile/torpedo launchers and respectable shields but having somewhat less maneuverability than its TIE counterparts, the assault gunboat is still a versatile fighter that can often be deployed without additional fighter support. 
<br />
<br />
<br />TIE Bomber - The bomber sports twin lasers, a proton torpedo launcher, a concussion missile launcher, and a proton bomb dropper (the bombs are awesome, trust me). Though unshielded, they have maneuverability that defies their designation as a bomber, and the firepower they can unload on a hard target is not to be ignored. Bombers make for prime targets and so should be guarded well against enemy fighters. 
<br />
<br />
<br />TIE Interceptor - The most agile ship in the galaxy, the interceptor mounts four laser cannons and can outrun all Alliance ships but the A-Wing. Interceptors must rely on their vastly superior handling and firepower to survive, as they lack shields and are only moderately durable. 
<br />
<br />
<br />TIE Fighter - Though quite nimble and easily a match for older fighters such as the Y-Wing and the Z-95, the TIE/f is painfully fragile and quickly perishes against any fighter it cannot drastically outfly or outgun. Still, with so many examples already constructed, the TIE/f routinely sees front line service, and in most cases performs acceptably well. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Rebel Alliance 
<br />
<br />
<br />::Capital ships:: 
<br />
<br />
<br />MC90 heavy cruiser - 1250 meters. The heaviest ship in the rebel fleet, capable of taking on an ISD in single combat or many smaller ships simultaneously. Armed with heavy turbolasers and ion cannons; expectedly, fighters at close range may be difficult to handle. 
<br />
<br />
<br />MC80 cruiser (with and without wings) - 1200 meters. Not initially intended to be a military craft as was the case with the MC90, this ship is thus drastically less powerful despite being about the same size as its newer cousin. As with the MC90, it is armed with heavy turbolasers and ion cannons and may not do well against fighters. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Assault Frigate - 600 meters. Built on the chassis of a dreadnaught, the assault frigate flaunts much improved firepower and shield strength. It can act as a backup to the MC ships or even as the heavy capital ship of a fleet when a mon cal cruiser is not available. They are quite nimble considering their size, and therefore are quite dangerous to smaller enemy capital ships. Armed with many turbolasers and a few defensive laser turrets, an assault frigate is more than a match for a Loronar strike cruiser, though taking on anything heavier would require considerable courage. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Dreadnaught - 600 meters. Same as the dreadnaught used by the empire, an old ship that is a moderate threat to enemy capital ships and fighters. Because of the overall shortage of rebel capital ships, these may see more front-lines action than their imperial counterparts. Armed with a few turbolasers and numerous heavy lasers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Nebulon-B Frigate - 300 meters. Same as the one used by the empire (indeed, these ships were stolen from the empire); capable of engaging both capital ships and fighters, they make for solid additions to any rebel fleet. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Bulk Cruiser - 600 meters. Though large, the bulk cruiser is a very old and slow capital ship that was originally intended to be a transport more than a man of war. Armed with numerous heavy laser turrets, they would still be in danger from a fight with a small vessel such as a Carrack. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Corellian Gunship - 120 meters. Small, fast and very deadly, the gunship is designed for combat and nothing else. With numerous light turbolasers and fast laser turrets, they are a good choice for hitting lightly-guarded convoys and chewing through enemy fighter squadrons. However, care must be taken to keep them out of range of enemy heavy capships, as they will not survive long against turbolaser fire. For comparison's sake, it would probably require three gunships to successfully defeat a carrack light cruiser. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Corellian Corvette - 150 meters. A ship that has seen countless variations, the corvette is a fast vessel but cannot match up to its smaller cousin in terms of raw firepower. Still, with two double turbolasers and four laser turrets it can wreak havoc on soft targets and hold its own long enough to escape if the situation turns ugly. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />::Fighters:: 
<br />
<br />
<br />B-Wing - The heavy bomber of the rebel fleet, though in truth it is still maneuverable enough to serve as a tolerable fighter if the situation absolutely requires it. Armed with a heavy load of proton torpedoes, a powerful laser cannon, twin fast laser cannons and three ion cannons, the B-wing is a serious threat to enemy capital ships, which is why imperial pilots often target them first in a fleet engagement; the shields of the B-wing are strong but can only do so much against concentrated fire. 
<br />
<br />
<br />A-Wing - Despite only mounting two laser cannons, the two concussion missile launchers, fantastic speed and small profile of the A-wing make it the supreme interceptor of the Alliance, allowing it to easily dispatch imperial fighters and conduct hit-and-run operations deep within the borders of the Empire. 
<br />
<br />
<br />X-Wing - The X-wing is the classic rebel fighter and a good all-around ship. Its four lasers and two proton torpedo launchers make it a severe threat to imperial fighters and capital ships alike, and though it is less mobile than the TIEs it fights against, a superior pilot at the controls can easily overcome this difference. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Y-Wing - An older fighter, the Y-Wing served as the primary bomber of the fleet until the introduction of the B-wing. Less maneuverable and slower than the other fighters it flies with, the Y-Wing can be easy prey for enemy TIEs, though with two lasers and two ion cannons as well as twin proton torpedo launchers it can still turn the tide of a fleet battle. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Z-95 - Another old fighter, the very common Z-95 cannot match up to the combat effectiveness of other Alliance fighters but is well suited to patrol and security duties. Two laser cannons, a complement of proton torpedoes and moderate shielding as well as respectable maneuverability give it sufficient punch to chase off pirate forces and the like.

<br />The Empire controls most of the known galaxy. Its forces stretch across the entire core but has little influence in the outer rim. The Emperor's word is law here, and those who oppose him often retreat into the outer rim for safety or take shelter on a moon within the core systems.

<br />Freedom fighters who oppose Imperial rule. These brave men and women station themselves mostly on starships scattered throughout the outer rim systems. They run hit and fade attacks on the Empire within the core and often exploit their advantage in fighter technology. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Black Sun- led by Prince Jadean
<br />
<br />
<br />The most advanced and organized crime faction in the galaxy. Basing themselves on Coruscant, the Black Sun operates within many fields, including smuggling, information gathering/selling, and even some legal business to gain easy profit. The Black Sun's information web is often compared in effectiveness to that of the Empire's.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hutt Syndicate- lead by Ramza The Hutt
<br />
<br />
<br />The Hutts control their own section of space, where crime is a way of life. Hutts rule as a mafia, often allowing anyone and everyone to hide from the public eye in their space...for a price. The trade for spice and slaves also originates mainly from Hutt space, and is kept intact due to the Empire not dabbling in the affairs of the Hutts. This is rumored to be an affect of a secret treaty between the Hutt lord and the Emperor.
<br />
<br />
<br />Bounty Hunters- Only 6 of these are allowed.
<br />
<br />
<br />These ruthless men and women will kill anyone for money, simple as that. Few bounty hunters gain notoriety, but those that do are feared throughout the galaxy.</div>

			<div class="content">Forums are on swcivilwar.bebbet.nl , or if you cant remeber that, swtow.tk.
<br />
<br />Diifferences: 
<br />
<br />To put it simply, twice as many systems, much more RP (all factions have an actual command structure), huge captial ships, &quot;hyperspace lanes&quot; (like trade lanes, but no objects, so capital ships can dock with them), only real SW fighters from the films and X-Wing series, no incredibly hard missions to start with, and much more. Only 1 server, so everybody meets everyone. Just check out the website and the forums to see it all.

			<div class="content">And seven days later, a reply... The mod is still very much alive and well, and in fact we are ever so slowly approaching the holy grail of a version fit for public consumption.  We have generally decided that a release on TLR won't be made until the mod is essentially complete, meaning that all of the systems are built and stable, the galactic economy is complete and all of the ships are satisfactorily balanced.  However, if you would like to join in on the post-alpha/pre-beta testing as well as take part in some preliminary roleplaying, please stop by <a href='http://forums.starwars-tidesofwar.co.uk' Target=_Blank>our current forums</a>.  Hopefully I will have the next release out within a week, although speaking from past experience this may just be a fool's hope.  Please bear in mind that the mod is still very much incomplete; if you want a complete mod, wait for the TLR release.  Also, if roleplaying is not your thing, our community is probably not for you.
<br />
<br />Edit: Just as a side comment, it's still pretty amazing to me that this thread is almost a year old.  I look forward more than ever to the day when I declare that this mod is now the ultimate power in the universe.  Yes... but anyway, my point was that the mod has changed quite a bit since this thread was first formed, so don't pay too much attention to any of Talon's earlier posts.  On that note, while this mod is intended for use on our roleplaying server, my objective is to set it up such that it could also be used on a general free-for-all server, or maybe a roleplaying server with different rules.
<br />
<br />Edit2: figured I should make the link actually work...

			<div class="content">Hi!
<br />
<br />At first, great work with the mod, but I have one question:
<br />
<br />Did you really create custom sur files? And is your method usable for other modders? Because, if you know how to do this and have a working tool for generating custom surs it would be great, if you could share this with the community. Of course it's nice to have your mod be the first with this, but if it needs some time until release many would be more grateful, if you could release the tool or the code for making custom surs before the mod.</div>
