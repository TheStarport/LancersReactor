<br />
<br />Prologue:
<br />
<br />               350 years after the first Nomad incident, the Nomads came back with a vengeance. They destroyed or infested most of the systems with lightening speed and there weren&#8217;t anyone to stop them.
<br />
<br />	The houses, Liberty, Bretonia, Kusari, and Rhineland, thought the Nomads were no more a threat and ordered The Order to be disbanded, because a lot of their income went to funding The Order, which to the houses was becoming a problem, since they were only interested in trade. Liberty hoped to setup their own research station in Dyson&#8217;s Sphere and therefore played a critical role in disbanding The Order. The Osiris was handed over to the Liberty Navy and renamed USS TRENT, in honor of the late Edison Trent who successfully led first war against the Nomads. The research station was never opened. Soon after The Order was disbanded, Rhineland declared war on Liberty. The other houses, Bretonia and Kusari, condemned the war and joined Liberty&#8217;s side. The war was unparalleled to any other great conflicts in history. Rhineland battleships were arriving in pairs of four everyday and soon controlled large sections of New York, including Manhattan. With law and order in chaos and possibility of the president being killed in the raid of Planet Manhattan, Liberty quickly surrendered to Rhineland. Many people joined the Rogues in the Badlands a place The Rhineland Fleet avoided for suspicious reasons. It was clear that the Rhineland government was controlled by Nomads, because shortly after Liberty accepted the surrender terms a huge fleet of Nomads took over Liberty infesting most of the people who weren&#8217;t infested during the war with the Rhinelander&#8217;s.
<br />
<br />	It also became clear that The Badlands had an eerie atmosphere which the where the Nomads couldn&#8217;t tolerate. Their battleships were shattered as they tried to enter The Badlands, and the victims they sent became in normal again as the nomad seeds in their body got destroyed. It became a safe haven for humans who were not infected. Soon there were more the fifteen bases alone in the Badlands. Rochester base was still operational and the base was only used by authorized personnel as an outpost. It needed to be heavily defended was given the best weapons platform money could buy by the Bretonians. A faction was formed by the people living in the Badlands, calling themselves FRIENDS OF HUMANITY. They began attacking Nomad battleships and strategic locations. This was the start of an epic battle between FOH and The Nomads. FOH had early victories and successfully captured the USS TRENT in a spectacular battle with the combined forces of Liberty Navy and The Nomads. The first leader of FOH was Field-Marshall Tito. Good times didn&#8217;t last long as Tito was assassinated by The Nomads while visiting Rochester. Now without an able leader to replace Tito, powers were shared by a handful of Tito&#8217;s closest generals. When things began to look good after some setbacks, disaster struck again.
<br />
<br />	This time Rhineland declared war on Bretonia, FOH&#8217;s closest ally, and overran much of their systems. The Bretonians also quickly surrendered, like liberty, and became another colony with Rhineland rule imposed. And as predicted, soon a wave of nomad fleets took over Bretonia. Unfortunately for civilians not infected yet, there weren&#8217;t any places like The Badlands and most of the Bretonians were infected by Nomad seeds passed by the Nomads. Few dared to use jump-holes to get to somewhere safe and a minority of the few managed to find and go there. Most tried to go to the Badlands, but many also tried the Border Worlds which was becoming a sanctuary for pirates and refugees.
<br />
<br />	It was obvious that Kusari was Rhineland&#8217;s next target, but what the planners didn&#8217;t know was when the attack would come and how. After 3 years of relatively quiet and peace with Bretonia, Liberty and Rhineland, a huge Nomad fleet decloaked in front of the capital of Kusari and took over in what seemed to the toughest battle yet for the Nomads, but after a year of fighting the government finally gave in and with New Tokyo in control, the Nomad&#8217;s launched a blitzkrieg on the remaining systems and captured them all meeting with heavy resistance but managing to win by sheer numbers. Now the Nomads were truly in control of Sirius.
<br />
<br />	The Corsairs along with the Outcasts amid the war with Kusari declared themselves a joint faction and a new house, Hispania. They were safe for the moment, because their systems had nothing valuable to the Nomad&#8217;s. Also another refugee site was the Border Worlds where all the pirates from all over Sirius came. They also formed a new faction, Pirates of the Border Worlds or PBW for short. So the Newly Formed Hispania and PBW along with FOH joined hands in the Triple Entente, pledging support to each other if attacked by any of the other houses or Nomads. Even still they feared of destruction by the Nomads and the battle goes on&#8230;</div>

			<div class="content">thanks for the information but i think it also seemed quite unlikely for the nomads to take over liberty first or for that matter any other houses. rhineland was an easy target because they had been infected before, thats why i chose them to be the ones to be infected again &amp; attack the rest of the houses.
<br />keep the feedback coming.
<br />chapter 1 will be out as soon as i am done with it.</div>

			<div class="content">Chapter 1 &#8211; A New Beginning
<br />
<br />A man was pacing up and down the corridor in the hospital wing of the Battleship Crimea. It was 3 am local time in the Badlands, when a doctor approached him
<br />&#8216;Congratulations Brigadier, you are a father.&#8217; The doctor said to him and walked off.
<br />The man couldn&#8217;t be happier. He quickly went into the ward where his wife was laying and kissed her. On a side of the room, there was a cradle, he looked and saw a small child with piercing blue eyes and fair skin with a little bit of blonde hair. What he didn&#8217;t know was that one day this child would be the last hope of humanity. The Brigadier was approached by a lieutenant.
<br />&#8216;Sir, Intel picked up unknown ships during a routine scan approaching the Badlands,&#8217; the lieutenant paused &#8216;and General Marshall wants you to investigate, Intel says there is a high probability that the ships are Nomad ships.&#8217; The lieutenant ended.
<br />&#8216;What? Nomads can&#8217;t survive the atmosphere here.&#8217;
<br />&#8216;I know but, that&#8217;s what Intel says and three Liberty Battleships are amongst them.&#8217; 
<br />
<br />Brigadier Romnel quickly left his family in the Crimea and went to investigate. In the docking bay was his ship, The Apocalypse. Some argued that it was the best ship ever built, but one thing was everyone was sure of was the fact that it had the most powerful shields in the Sirius, and only a score of them existed. He left the docking bay and entered the Badlands. The place was very congested because of many bases and battleships stationed there. It is estimated that there are at least 20 bases and 15 battleships in the Badlands. He rendezvous with his squad at the USS TRENT and went to the given waypoints in the neural net.

<br />Intel was right about the three Liberty Battleships, but where were the Nomads? The three battleships quickly attacked with a bunch of Defenders and Patriots but the Liberty ships were no match for the group of an Apocalypse and a bunch of Titan Exterminators. With the smaller ships down the group attacked the closest battleship, the USS MISSOURI. It didn&#8217;t take long for it to suffer heavy damages but soon came the face of General Marshall over the comm.
<br />&#8216;We need all fighters back in the Badlands, I repeat all fighters.&#8217; Shouted the General.
<br />&#8216;Okay men, you heard the general. Disengage and return to base.&#8217;
<br />
<br />When the squadron returned to the Badlands, they understood why the general wanted them back so badly. The place was being overrun by Nomads. The FOH ships were falling like flies and Romnel quickly went to the Crimea leaving his squadron to fight the Nomads. Once inside, he took his wife and newly-born infant to an escape ship in Buffalo Base which is supposed to take them to the Border Worlds first and then to Hispania. As he kissed his wife good-bye more missiles struck the base. He quickly left the docking bay and engaged all hostiles. It was phenomenal; everything on the display tab was red. He quickly took out the nearest hostiles with his Hell-Raiser guns. He then took on a Battleship and armed with his Astatine Torpedoes, he with lightening speed annihilated the USS NIMITZ. While the ship broke apart, he saw a ship leaving into the Magellan system. Knowing his job was done, he quickly docked with the battleship USS TRENT. Romnel went to the briefing room where he was met by General Marshall and a host of Brigadiers and Colonels.
<br />The General started, &#8216;What happened out there we don&#8217;t know. But right now, we know that the Nomads have managed to breach our defenses and&#8230;&#8217; he never got to finish his sentence as a torpedo hit the room. There was a rush to escape from the room as the battleship took on heavy damages. Romnel left the battleship soon after and engaged all hostiles. He knew the FOH has been dying for sometime but now it was truly dead without a leader. He was thinking of what is going to happen to them, when he was hit by a missile. He quickly came back out of his dream and went back fighting and began taking down a bunch of Defenders and Patriots, but he also was taking in steady damage. After fighting what seemed days the last of the fighters were taken down and only one battleship remained. The remaining fighter made quick work of it and all those still living, docked with five bases and two battleships remaining. Romnel with the remaining Brigadiers went to Rochester.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile Julie, wife of Romnel, looked at the empty vacuum of space with her newly-born son as their ship traveled through the Magellan system, wishing her husband was here, when all of a sudden their ship was attacked by the Bretonian Navy, but the escorts were more powerful than six crusaders and made mincemeat of them. As all the residents in the ship saw the crusaders being sent in the scrapyard, they knew that this was going to an epic struggle for survival&#8230;</div>

			<div class="content">but i thought as soon as nomads entered any area of the badlans they instantly died?!?!?!?!?  must be some new technology i quess.  good story though a bit exiting but try to not make the whole story a big battlescene.
<br />
<br />its cool when there not always fighting and theres more to the storie like he enters the ship and suddenly out of no where the base is under attack again.
<br />
<br />a BS dosent move that fast and teh scanners would have picked it up before the guy could have docked..
<br />
<br />My one peice of advice:  draw out the talking scenes a bit mroe so its not all shhot and run shoot and run.
<br />
<br />but otherwise it sounds awsome!</div>
