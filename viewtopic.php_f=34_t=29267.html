			<div class="content">To Chips,
<br />
<br />I have a few questions about how you've done your game.
<br />
<br />1. Tobacco as a commodity is apparently illegal and can be scanned ( I haven't shipped any yet, just saw it on Corsairs base).  But the only places to really sell it and make some money are other Pirate factions.  I understand that these lawless factions would desire something like that, but wouldn't it be a higher price on the bigger planets where the stuff is banned outright?
<br />
<br />2. Is Leeds not supposed to be able to buy Pirate Pilots? I noticed this planet and 1 other (in the list so far) I can't remember off-hand which one, didn't allow the selling of Pirate Pilots to the commoditites dealer. Was this a choice to do it that way?
<br />
<br />3. Did you alter the settings on the friendliness you need with a faction to buy from them?  It sometimes seems a bit excessive, or maybe because you've added so many new items to the game that the list of what I can't buy is so much longer.  However, the commodities rarely work for me to buy them if I am only neutral and that doesn't seem right.
<br />
<br />4. I forget what system this jump was off of, but there is an &quot;Unknown Jumphole&quot; with a lot of ship carcasses around it that has a Nomad attack zone around it.  My question is, having seen the beautiful system on the other side, is there any place to go and dock or is just for a peek?
<br />
<br />5. Since when do Nomads have Cruise disruptors (the main impediment for me searching that system)?
<br />
<br />6. When you make flight patterns in your new systems, are they separate coding from what appears as flight patterns on a normal FL map?  Because it is really hard to find anything without them.
<br />
<br />7. What posessed you to come up with Cardamined Pets? <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />That's all for now, maybe I'll have more. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />it seems like the pirates are adicted to tobaco but the tobaco is outlawed on the planets  
<br />

<br />leeds is home of the biggest moron in the game TRENT nuff said

<br />he made it so that trading is not so easy anymore

<br />
<br />you went to 1 of the 2 nomad systems [SPOILER {WARNING MASSIVE SPOILER} the one in theta i think lead to an system with 2 planets gammu and primus you can dock but i doubt you can find anything good there.
<br />
<br />5. Since when do Nomads have Cruise disruptors (the main impediment for me searching that system)?
<br />
<br />they have them beacause chips made the Ai smarter but i havent found any of it they still flash like a crhistmas tree
<br />

<br />
<br />seems like those lines are hardcoded.
<br />
<br />7. What posessed you to come up with Cardamined Pets?
<br />
<br />his bro lives on the caribian and puts cardi in his body and his folks always call him doggy</div>

<br />I realise that, but wouldn't the place they are banned have the highest value to those who can't get it otherwise?
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>leeds is home of the biggest moron in the game TRENT nuff said <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />Point taken. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>he made it so that trading is not so easy anymore <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font> Okay, it works.  I think it is a good idea for game play, but from a market supply &amp; demand background it's bad business technique for bases not to sell to certain people, just because they weren't drinking buddies.  The prices on the commodities could have been lowered instead of limiting the friendly selection.

I thought because of the design of their ships that they were all energy based, thus only had guns.

			<div class="content">Yeah - sorry, patrol paths are a bugger sometimes <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> (scuse the language) and although one was made to work by firebase, its near impossible to get the damned things to work, they cause crahes <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />The reps for trading is based around value usually (although some mistakes were made) - but for most stuff your rep needs  to be 0 instead of -1 (ie perfectly neutral).
<br />
<br />Cardmined pets - dunno - i was drunk i think, and thought how drugs were smuggled in real life, and semi resented the fact i was about to include such a poncy commodity as pets..........so my warped mind made &quot;cardamine en fido&quot;.
<br />
<br />Nomads have cruise disruptors cause they were always WAY to easy since they were supposed to be tough and scary. this is an attempt to improve that.
<br />
<br />Gammu and other one - I have added somethign there now, it will be worth it <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />
<br />Tobacco should actually sell best to prison stations - where it can be sold for the most money...........crims in jail always pay <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />In next version i have tried to make &quot;semi&quot; patrol paths, but they won't appear on nav map. It will be for areas of space that have no tradelanes........you click on an NPC and click formation - and tehy will fly you the 30k or so to the jumphole <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">@Chips, good to hear about the commodities being listed.  But I thought of a new question ... is it possible to limit the number of commodities that are sold at a particular base?  Privateer did that and it was always random chance that you came across enough commodities to make a really great run.  If it is possible I'd much prefer that as opposed to not being able to buy anything.  Or even lowering all the prices would be preferable.
<br />
<br />Also, as it is now, it seems like all the best runs are to the same 4 systems.  Omicron Gamma, Tau 37, Omicron Alpha &amp; Omega 41.  A little evening out might be in order.
