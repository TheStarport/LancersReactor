			<div class="content">Ok folks here it is In one word. WOW!
<br />
<br />For those of us who like the WC, Privateer, Elite and many others, you know who you are.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif  border=0 align=middle> This is a must have! The Sp campaign might be a tad short, but let me add it  gets very intense. We percieve the story line as being short because the story is told so eloquently, much  like a good book it leaves you wanting more. This is not a negative! It is my sincere hope thata DA makes an expansion pack or FL2. 
<br />
<br />The graphics are very good and most importantly it plays very well on a PIII 600. Sure some of the textures could have been better but they are darned good.  
<br />
<br />The only real downside is the BAR commentary, you will tire of hearing something like &quot;We do not truly own this place but we have influence with those who do.&quot; or &quot;You New here?&quot; That aside is just a mere annoyance. It should not color your judgement on the real game.
<br />
<br />The interface is easy to learn, so much so that I never read the manual. Tool tips are great. The mouse control is done extermely well. Much better than anticipated, it does take some getting used to. Once you do it seems very natural.
<br />
<br />The combat modle is nothing short of outstanding! The computer AI is really not bad as AIs go. I did find myself wanting a roll manouver, but other than that combat is rock solid.
<br />
<br />For those of you who do not like combat then be a freighter pilot.
<br />
<br />The sound on a Dolby 5.1 surround sound is absolutely stunning! The cinematics are as good as it gets, when combined with GREAT voice talents and some very recognizable personalities in the game.
<br />
<br />Travel between planets and star systems or what is known in the MMO world as Zoning is handeled extremely well. The best I have seen, very seemless.
<br />
<br />I now understand why it took 5+ years to make, the level of detail in the game is simply unbelievable. Sure there are a few aforementioned short comings but they are bot bad. 
<br />
<br />All I can say about the story line is WOW. You really have to experience it. There are many surprizes waiting for you throughout the SP game. I never knew who to trust. This was great!
<br />
<br />In the end I would like to see MS/DA take this game into the MMO world. Not with servers that can handle up to 128 people but with 2-3 thousand per server group. This game would absolutely rock! 
<br />
<br />I wish to formally thank the DA team, Chris, Erin, the FL team and MS for a truly wonderful experience. This game WAS worth waiting for IMHO. 
<br />
<br />Now I need to go figure out how I want to play online! The other really great aspect of the game and find out what I haven't seen in this truly wonderful sector of space.
<br />
<br />9.5 overall is how I would score it. Excellent game! 
<br />
<br />See you all out there some where!
<br />
<br />Lance
<br />
<br />I need how much cash to fix my rep? You take credit...right?
<br />
<br />P.S. I almost forgot. Outside of a couple little sound issues and the color coding on the commodity prices being backwards, the program is all but bug free. Great Work Team!
