			<div class="content">As the title of the topic say, I'm going back to school this fall.  Classes start on the 23rd of August.  I just finished filling out my federal aid about 6 minutes ago.  I'll be taking a one year certificate course for Network Administration.  After that, I still have to decide where I want go next.  It's a start for now, and I finally got off my lazy hide and did something about it.  I'm pretty excited about going back to school.  I'll be going to a local state college.  My brother's taking business classes at another college and my mom's taking art classes at the University of Utah.  I figure it's about damn time I get my life moving forward.  It also sounds more fun than high school.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p408867" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Ah, the joys of public school, where teachers are so stupid you'd wonder how the hell they got their degrees to teach, administrators are tyrants, everyone on the school board has their head up their ass, etc...
<br />
<br />Ah, good times good times. Thankfully, I won't be having to deal with that kind of [censored anymore. My parents are finally starting to get a vague idea of the kind of [use imagination here that I go through every day at that school (bout time) and it still took them forever to be willing to do anything about it. My neigbhor's daughter was going through the same thing, and her mother finally took her out of public school and in to a home schooling program. Because we went to the same school, her mother knew the kind of crap I was getting from them, and if she hadn't stepped in, my parents would have never even considered home schooling for me. (This is what years of smoking pot does to you, makes you so stupid that it's almost unreal.) You just wouldn't believe how stupid they can be sometimes.
<br />
<br />People down here have their heads way too far up their asses. I almost got suspened for theft because I took two ketsup packits from the lunch room instead of one (they gave us burgers AND fries that day, and one pack just isn't enough.) I got suspened for two days for &quot;racist comments&quot; because I called some black girl a ***** (she started this crap with me, I tried politely asking her to leave me alone to begin with and she wouldn't, after thirty minutes of this I eventually lost my temper.) I was suspended for three days (almost expelled) because I flicked a piece of &quot;graphite&quot; that's maybe a millimeter long off the tip of my mechanical pencil and hit the dude in the arm. (I'd twisted my ankle the day before and it still hurt, he walked by and purpously kicked it, causing it to hurt again.) There was no conflict, we were done with our work and waiting to go to lunch, and to pass the time we were just joking around. I did it, my teacher starts screaming at the top of her lungs that it's assault, it could've landed in his eye, etc. The school saw it fit to press assault charges against me, thankfully I didn't have to even go to trial because of my excellent lawyer. The guy I shot was my friend, and he kept saying that it was no big deal, and he asked to have the charges dropped. Of course, sence when did the school listen to the students?
<br />
<br />Anyway, enough of my boring story. I'm just glad I'll never have to go back there again. My social stuides teacher was bipolar, my LA teacher was an old hag that thought she knew everything and could do whatever the hell she wanted, my science and my math teachers were probably two of the best I've ever had. At the end of the prevoius school year, I was improperly placed into the advanced math class, and my math teacher could have let me just fail. But, she pulled strings, worked with me as much as she could, and when she realized it was a mistake for me to be in the advanced class, she pulled more strings and did everything she could to make sure that I was moved into her slower class so that I wouldn't have so much trouble. I've always struggled in math, it's never been easy for me, and it's always been my worst subject, next to Language Arts. My science teacher was one of those teachers who's just plain cool, he'll work with you, sure he mostly taught by lecturing, but he'd joke around, you could stop him at any time to ask him to clarify something, etc...
<br />
<br />It's such a shame that more than 5% of the teachers here can't be like that. 
<br />
<br />@Everyone DO NOT send your children to public school in the state of Georgia. It'll be the worst mistate of your life, and the worst mistake of their lives.
<br />
<br />(Sorry for the long post/rant but I've been having a bad week and I needed to blow off some steam.)

			<div class="content">I used to be in Fayette. So sad that the assistant principal at FMS was such a (you know what.) I said I thought a girl was pretty and she suspeneded me for sexual harassment. Not to mention, this one dude kept assaulting me and wouldn't leave me alone, and my parents (I couldn't stop them, I wanted to just kick the dude's ass and let that be the end of it) pressed charges against him, got him sent to Juvi for three months, and now all of his friends and all of the gangs he was involved with hate me. If it wasn't for those two people, I would have gladly stayed there.

			<div class="content">^ True. But my school is already overcrouded. In most cases, they have to assign four people to a seat on the buses (WE'RE ALL TO FRIGGIN BIG FOR THAT NOW!) But does the school board care? No. Do they get new busses? No. If they actually didn't have the money, then I would be a little more understanding. However, they have enough money to treat their teachers to nice lunches, to hold these stupid pep rallies where the band plays (they suck) the cheerleaders cheer (they're ugly) and usually some guy will come out into the middle of the gym and speak to us about not taking drugs for two and a half hours. Also, they love to bring in a bunch of guys called The Power Team. Sure, they do some cool stuff, but it costs hundreds of dollars every time they're brought out there, and they're brought out there a lot.
<br />
<br />Although my school was voted the worst in Henry county by the schoolboard, there is one thing that I do like about it. They haven't had to start using trailers yet. And thankfully, I'll never have to go back there. It does suck that I probably won't be seeing some of my friends again, but I just can't deal with this anymore. They've already screwed my life up enough and let all the blame fall on me, and they're just going to keep doing it to everyone.
<br />
<br />*Sighs.* It really is depressing when you think about it, because most parents don't believe their children when they try to tell them what goes on at school. Then, the teacher just says they're lying and that's the end of it, and the child is usually punished because the teacher is an asshole. And after a while of that, it gets degrading, because you eventually become convinced that no one will ever believe you no matter what you say, and eventually you just give up and take the crap. That's why nothing has been done about this, but I'm really suprised that the students haven't gone into full-fledged riot mode.</div>

			<div class="content">I'm surprised that my UNi's students haven't gone into a full fledged riot...
<br />Last year, or the year before, some bright minister said that we have too mnay UNi's or somethign like that...the result of that was that colleges and uni's had to merge.
<br />So  my uni, UNISA (university of south africa) merged with two other colleges, all correspondence based.
<br />This happened middle last year I think.
<br />So, this year they come up with this absolutely brilliant new website...the forums works in this way.
<br />The student starts a topic, then have to email the lecturer that the topic can be activated and someone actually post in it!
<br />This despite the fact that we get told in out tutorial letters how busy the lecturers are. APart from this...we use the forums for student interaction...the students also help each other, esp when the lecturers are too busy.
<br />Now, I'm in the School of Computing section of the uni. In my first year I had a subject called &quot;Human computer interface&quot; teaching us the basics about designing usable and good interfaces.
<br />I saw email correspondence one of the students had with the bugmaster of the site, in this, bugmaster claimed that the users from the School of computing are the worst users of the system...well duh! We know what a proper website/interface should look like.
<br />This being one frustration...being countered by the fact that the School of computing has its own site/forums (our lecturers actually advises us to use that one)
<br />
<br />Apart from that, the assignment marking is so far behind, it's rediculous. 
<br />This whole merger thing is a mess.
<br />pfft.
<br />
<br />
<br />Meezo...good for you for going back to school, I hope you'll enjoy it!</div>
