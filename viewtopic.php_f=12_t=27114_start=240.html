			<div class="content">REACTIVATION ORDERS - OPS ULTRA TOP SECRET
<br />
<br />From: The Office of His Celestial Glory Sultan Fear Factor IV
<br />
<br />To: All loyal commanders of His Celestial Glory's front-line units currently on stand-down, especially mechanized divisions of the 1st Draconian Measures, 72nd Bear Maulers and armor division 51st Dragon Slayers (aka St George's Iron Paladins), and tactical fighter/bomber wings 101st Clarity of Thought.
<br />
<br />BRIEFING CONTENT:
<br />
<br />As you all know, loyal sons of Factorovia, we are currently in a stand-down status, 10 days after your initial deployments to the borders of our realm, in preparation of our brewing PDRNS and to support our brothers and sisters in Mustantopia, and to liberate the paper-bagged women under the oppression of Tawakalna. I know that you all are optimistic about the New Year peace talks, but celebrations or peace will have to wait. After careful studies of recent events, I am recalling the stand-down orders and cancelling all leaves. All units are to upgrade to highest defense condition, although weapons are still tight.
<br />
<br />This is the situation: 
<br />
<br />roughly six hours ago, a group of elite special forces of unknown origin and allegiance took control of one of our nuclear silos, previously believed to be secret and safe well behind the borders, killing 41 security and science personnels stationed there. Fortunately our launch operatives managed to put the lockdown procedures in place, securing the silos and themselves in their reinforced bunkers. However, the intruders appeared to have the codes and hacking skills necessary to unlock the firing mechanisms, apparently trying to aim our missiles against major cities of PDRNS.
<br />
<br />Our reaction was swift and deadly. O-Niwaban special forces was mobilized and quickly entered and regained dominance over the site, however no further informations are acquired since those not killed by our warriors took their own lives to keep their identities secret.
<br />
<br />Conclusion:
<br />Our Hive Intelligence Tanks, after careful analysis of this event, combined with the orbital photographies, and confessions of the captured spies, concluded that there is a 76% possibility that the splinter-nation of DUSK is behind this. Behind their false pretenses of neutrality and volunteering to host the peace talks, they actually intend to escalate the conflicts between Mustantopia-Factorovia Alliance and PDRNS and her allies - driving to make us the scapegoats in this conflict. The belligerency previously displayed by DUSK's leader freighter fighter (aka  ff, not to be confused with ME, that's FF with capitals) while still a lapdog of PDRNS is not compatible with his current peace-loving stance.
<br />
<br />Satellite shots demonstrate a hostile convoy of armored and mechanized infantries heading towards the peace talks location. I am ordering our envoys to evacuate, and this is where you boys come in. Your orders:
<br />
<br />1. Bear Maulers and Dragon Slayers are to swing round and enter the DUSK borders by force. Crush all opponents using the pincer attacks on objectives Able, Baker, and Dog. 
<br />
<br />2. Once in position, dig in and send out a patrol to meet our evacuating envoys and escort them back to safety.
<br />
<br />3. Once orders 1 and 2 are met, wait reinforcements. I am currently activating our reserve air and infantry assets to watch your flanks. Before they arrive, you can only hope for Clarity's close air supports.
<br />
<br />4. As for the 1st Draconian Measures, maintain defensive positions around PDRNS borders, should they be foolish enough to try and take advantage of the Maulers' and the Slayers' absence. As the only elite-rated division on the frontline, you are the only ones able to prevent that, either through fear and reputation or by absolute combat ruthlessness.
<br />
<br />5. Clarity of Thought fighters and bombers are to maintain CAS to both fronts until reinforcements arrive.
<br />
<br />Possible scenarios:
<br />Although we do not know yet what is Tawakalna's intentions in the whole scheme, we conclude that he is also a victim of his own former servant, ff, since those intruders DID try to level Tawakalnian cities. We shall know the truth when ff's thugs reach the peace talks locations and if they capture Taw's envoys. HOWEVER, if proven otherwise, our generals and Mustang's generals have devised Operation Blue Spoon, aimed at launching one final strike at him and <i>reduce his status </i> to dust. The Measures are to march and link up with Lord Mustang's 2nd and 6th Armies, and get the job done.
<br />
<br />May His Celestial Glory's immortal wisdom guide you.</div>

			<div class="content">Operation: Blue Spoon has long been the planned action against the Red threat of the PDRNS. It has been formulated by the Knighthood of the Moderaytior, a mystic and ancient society of which both Sultan Fear Factor IV and myself are members of. For centuries (by that I mean a couple of years) the Moderaytior have held a deathly vice-like grip on the Forumlands of Utopia, and have used thier powers to control her financial and political movements for thier own gain. 
<br />
<br />We have allowed the rise of Comrade Tawakalna to power as his aggresive political and war like stance has allowed all countries of Utopia to enter into armed conflict. This inturn, with the production of weapons of war, has dragged the economy into a new golden age. The Knighthood of the Maderaytior has advantaged by this by buying heavily into companies producing weapons of war and has further strengthened it's stance within Utopian society. 
<br />
<br />However Comrade Tawakalna has now served his purpose and he is no longer required by the Moderaytior. Therefore the enabling of Operation: Blue Spoon will ensure his termination from leadership and will allow us to install a new puppet government with-in the lands currently held by the PDRNS.</div>

<br />&lt;seeth&gt;
<br />&lt;kicks cat in petulant frustration&gt;
<br />
<br />Soldiers of the Revolution! Loyal Cadres of Tawakalna! Your Motherland (and me) is in imminent danger! Beset on all sides by our enemies, despite our sincerest efforts to live in socialist fraternity, we face total annihilation! I hereby authorise all forces to ENGAGE THE ENEMY with all force immediately, before the FF-ists and mustantopians can bring their dreaded *click* weapons to bear!
<br />
<br />Marshal Locutov, repeat your heroic defence of the chip shop! Stand firm, let no invader set foot upon our sacred soil (well my sacred soil I've just got me turf as I want it)
<br />Commissar Indinsky, mobilise civil defence battalions and mobilise support amongst all citizens. Shoot anyone who resists. Get me out of this!
<br />General Orilliosk, send all your reserves into battle. Crush the enemy with err.. suicidal frontal assaults against technologically superior forces! then destroy everything afterwards so the enemy can't use it 
<br />Comrade Aceaz, your Revolutionary Guard battalions are to show no mercy and annihilate enemy forces with whatever means available. Fight to the last man and the last bullet! Now! Throw yourselves into battle with revolutionary zeal! yes, that's it..
<br />
<br />(hmmm remarkably inspiring orders so far if i say so myself...)
<br />
<br />Comrade Scientist Esquilov, I sincerely hope my secret weapons are ready! the Motherland desperately needs an anti-click defence system and a modyerator neutraliser! like yesterday..
<br />Comrade dark_reaper, as Commissar for Military Intelligence I want the enemy's weaknesses unearthed and exploited immediately.
<br />Comrade Griffon_26, as Commissar for Special Actions you must defend myself and the Politburo from harm from the enemy AT WHATEVER COST.
<br />
<br />Comrade zeratural remains deep undercover and i am unable to inform him of his mission. Oh s*d it, he'll figure it out.
<br />
<br />No matter what may come upon you, defend the Revolution to the bitter end! Remember, the Revolution is the Will of the People, the Will of the people is manifest in the Party, and I am the Party. Once again you are called upon to sacrifice yourselves for the defence of my errr OUR Utopia, and to pay the ultimate sacrifice if necessary.
<br />
<br />the glorious Armed forces and Citizens of the Revolution march off to war, while myself and Commissar Indy prepare for the defence of the Motherland, in which of course we will be removing ourselves to a place of safety. probably Cuba.
<br />
<br />I leave you with a final inspirational scene, of myself and Commissar indy reviewing our brave troops as they march off to the front, while we plan the security of the Revolution...

			<div class="content">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
<br />Version: 8.0.1
<br />
<br />To: Great Leader Tawakalna
<br />From: Ministry of Science, Technology &amp; Weapons Development
<br />Subject: Top Secret
<br />
<br />Hail Most Gracious Leader! As you are aware, the security of my Ministry has been compromised. The PGP Keys stored on our servers were leaked to DUSK, which has apparently allowed them to create countermeasures to &quot;Project Xi&quot;. I have fully investigated the ministry, and have discovered the informant. He appears to have been swayed by the propaganda prepared by DUSK, and under extensive &quot;persuasion&quot; has cast serious doubts as to the performance of the &quot;missile shield&quot; that we have heard about. In fact, it would appear the the missile shield is currently only in its experimental stages, and will not be operational until after the peace summit. The spy has an astonishing amount of information for a simple field operative, and further questioning is recommended in order to establish his true identity.
<br />
<br />Regarding the new stealth missiles designated &quot;Project Phi&quot;, payloads have been configured to bear maximum payloads, and the target has been set. The missiles should be effective despite the supposedly fully operational &quot;missile shield&quot; possessed by DUSK, as they are completely undetectable. They have also been configured to be to activate in all weather condictions, and the new ION-based propellant will remove the threat of heat-seeking missile defences.
<br />
<br />This email has been upgraded to the newest version of PGP, and is now using new public and private keys. All staff in the Ministry have been screened, and a few &quot;examples&quot; have been made to insure their full cooperation. There is no need to fear another security breach, as the families of all staff have been removed to secure bunkers for their protection.
<br />
<br />Death to the Capitalists!
<br />
<br />
<br />Esquilaxiov.

<br />Head of Ministry of Science, Technology &amp; Weapons Development.

			<div class="content">Aha! our pacifistic ff now shows his true nature. But I think you are bluffing. Crashing the moon to Earth will result in total MAD, killing everyone including yourself.
<br />
<br />News from the front: Both divisions sent to conquer DUSK have accomplished their objectives, but suffering over 70% casualties (no, not KIA, but rather got sent to the army shrinks for mental breakdown. Apparently killing human wave attacks employed by the Tawakalnian Revolutionary Guards was too much to handle for our peace-loving warriors) To alleviate this problem, we had to use a much less personal method of killing, using airstrikes by Clarity bomber wings.
<br />
<br />Believe me my loyal sons and daughters, I share your tears! bear with this burden, and you will all soon go back to your families.</div>
