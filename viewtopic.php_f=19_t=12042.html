			<div class="content">This is the lamest excuse I have ever heard for making money. I play on E2 and met a guy who was all cool, we did co-op missions together, discussed everything from the game to personal lives, was a really cool guy to know and play with. Today, im talking to him and asked him if he knew about Ripper Mines, he said he just got it off of a wreck, along with a WildFire and some Blue Blazes. So I asked him which wreck, and he said hes not sure. He said he goes around, harvesting everything off of ships all around the galaxy, im calling this ASL (Abandoned Ship Leeching) basically, what my &quot;friend&quot; does is set waypoints around all of E2's expansive galaxy, then go around once every 5-6 days on all the wrecks, and collects every single gun they drop, after wards he goes, repairs them and sells them. For a tidy profit nonetheless, I have been looking for a pair of WildFires for a very long time and finally realized why I could never find any. As you can tell as soon as he told me he does that I was completely mortified.
<br />
<br />I found it so hard to believe that someone I get so well along with could possibly exploit the game in such a way, afterwards, my respect sank for him to a level where I basically considered him a cheater. Why would he do something like that when he can go do a mission on Planet Crete for 240k and get a huge payoff in roughly 15 minutes? I dont know, I just know I was very surprised, what a pathetic excuse for a freelancer player, going around harvesting guns, making a HUGE disadvantage for people who actually need weapons, I mean, have any of you realized how much it sucks to get super happy about a wreck you have found, only too shoot it and get jack-squat, and fly away grumbling about how cheap it is. I swear it makes me wanna catch these people, throw em on planet malta and make them swim for 12 straight hours in the yellow grass (it has rumors that people have bled to death with only a few feet into the fields).
<br />
<br />I cant control it, but sometimes I wonder where peoples morals have gone, I mean seriously, what happened to Netiquette, honor and morale, now everyone is just scouring for more exploits and easy money to make, and screw others over. So the morale of the story is, no matter how nice they are over the internet, even the nicest of people can be involved in a little &quot;tainted&quot; business, be careful who you choose as your friends.................

			<div class="content">whoohahahaha...I feel sorry for you...whiner...Do you think it's easy to harvest the wrecks? Painless? I guess that you have not been harvesting the corsair fighters in omicron gamma then. SO...if the guy decides that harvesting is the way for him to make money it's NOT exploting the game..it's playing it. Unusual way, yes...but cheating? you must be kidding.
<br />In Elite (the original space trading game) if you bought lots of goods on one planet for a cheap price, the price would go up for next player who landed on that planet...so if the guy youy are talking about bought lots of goods cheap from lots of planets...would that be exploiting the game too?
<br />I believe that the guns are for the taking for anyone...and if someone decides that harvesting is his thing it's up to him! NOT YOU!</div>

			<div class="content">So someone has a better knowlegde of the galaxy than you and its their fault? 
<br />Its not like many wreck weapons are good enough to keep, anyone can get nomad weapons which are free, also if your &quot;need&quot; weapons go buy them there are plenty of them around.
<br />
<br />You say go do a mission at crete for 250,000k but thise missions are simple, its a lot more of a challenge to fly around the galaxy &quot;Salvaging&quot; taking about 2- 3 hours and possibly making a lot less while encountering 100's of enemies.
<br />
<br />The bottom line is if you dont like it scan other players cargo and if they have a heap of wreck weapons kill them and tractor them.
<br />
<br />The point of the game is to be a freelancer taking jobs of your choice and letting these jobs reflect your moral judgements. In this game my choice of career is to be a weapons merchant, I hunt nomads, corsairs, outcast and anyone else who gets in the way for hours then return to NY and trade the weapons with other players for token amounts of cash, most of the time I give anything under lvl 7 away for no charge and this is my choice. Just because people choose to make their own proffession thats not in the manual it does not mean they are cheaters or exploiters, their are plenty of of other careers you can make up like being a bounty hunter hired to kill other players, an escort etc its what makes Freelancer what it is

			<div class="content">i play on E2 as well, ive seen you there, most of the wrecks are salvagable it would be impossible for him to go to everyone, there isn't really anything wrong with what he is doing i would fing it boring though and btw who is it? (you probably wont tell me, but since i play on the server too it would be nive to know)

Mind you, I've only looked in the core systems. Is it me? or is there a re-spawn period for the hulks in MP... cause I cleaned almost every one out in SP!!! All I can say is DOH!!! Nothing... nada... zilch!!!

<br />  And as far as &quot;Wreck Harvesting&quot; goes... QUIT YER WHINING!!! Ever tried it? 
<br />  Or are you just soooo l337 that you can tackle anything w/out a worry... and if 
<br />  so, did you hack the .ini files or hex-edit your memory?  hmmm???

			<div class="content">ok, well Godlike, you had the right idea, no, i wont tell you what his name is, albeit i do think what he is doing is wrong doesnt justify me to tell anyone who he is. Anyway, i do know about most wrecks, and, im NOT looking for weapons, so in other words some of these replies dont really make sense, i just find it stupid for a guy to be going around harvesting wrecks and selling the weapons to stations, maybe there is nothing wrong with it, but its a really cheap way to make money, and i disagree, many of the best prototype weapons in the game are dropped of wrecks, but ok, seeing as you guys think its ok, i guess i will too, though it just doesnt feel right to be watching a guy collect every weapon thats a prototype off of derelicts and leaving empty wrecks for everyone on the server, although i am quite to blame for it, seeing as i gave him Co-Ords of many major battlefield and wrecks in the game **slaps forehead** ok, forget the post, anyway, godlike, yeah, i did see you on E2, i was flying around the Hispania wreck, you were sitting there and me and this one other dude were having a little in character fun, so even though those bounty hunters were neutral and attacking a the hispania, both of us being corsairs we reacted with a &quot;Defend the Hispania!!!!&quot; and took them out, hehehe, amazing what people come up with when your bored and overpowered

<br />As far as I know, the only way to get level 10 weapons or a Sunslayer is wreck hervesting.
<br />
<br />As far as I am concerned, wreck harvesting is just as valid a way to make cash as running missions or robbing freighters. Besides, the wrecks regenerate after 2 hours so anyone can harvest later. It's not like the stuff is permanently gone.</div>
