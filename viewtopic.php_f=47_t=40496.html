<br />
<br />
<br />PART 1 - THE NOMADS REPENT
<br />   
<br />   For decades it has been the Order's job to keep Nomads away from Sirius, and it' population. However, this job will become twice as difficult when there is almost no Order left! It has been approximately 2 years since the Nomad homeworld was destroyed.However, a bigger problem was about to emerge. It started one day, just a typical day. The Osiris was stationed in the system called &quot;The Bottom Unkown&quot;, launching patrols to keep the Nomads from escaping into Omicron Beta. It was then that it happened...
<br />
<br />   It was the worst thing that could have happened. A Nomad ship, more larger, leathal, and dangerous than anyone could have imagined, uncloaked in front of the Osiris. It was the Nomad mothership. It began to &quot;breed&quot; Nomad fighters. They just formed off it. They opened fire on the Osiris. All of the available wings in the sector opened fire. In less than 15 maybe 20 minutes, 4 of the 5 wings in the system were destroyed. The last wing, Red wing, covered the Osiris as it engaged it's cruise engines twoards Omicron Minor. 
<br />
<br />   Once the Osiris  arrived 2 days later, it's crew witnessed a sight more horrible than death. A Nomad invasion of Toledo. Nomad fighters and Anubises were scrambling and shooting everywhere. &quot;Oh my god&quot; is all the Order Leader, Orillion, could say. After the biggest fight in Sirius history, the Order was able to fend off the Nomad invasion. Leaving no more than 50 Order Pilots, a total of 10 wings, and the Osiris. This day would be known as the raid.
<br />
<br />  Several months after the invasion, the Order began to notice more and more Nomad activity in Omicron Minor. They couldn't keep losing pilots like this. They needed an ally. Someone good. Someone they could trust.
<br />
<br />  A meeting between Orillion, the Order leader, Admiral Green, leader of tactical operations, Advisor Cartel, the diplomat of the Order, and other Order officials was held to decide what to do.
<br />
<br />  &quot;Well, gentlemen, it doesn't seem as though we can handle this on our own,&quot; said Orillion, &quot;We're losing pilots and equipment too fast. We need some help so we can organize an attack on this new mother ship. Green, how many wings do we have left?&quot;
<br />&quot;A total of 8 sir,&quot; he replied, in his Scottish accent.
<br />&quot;Hmm. That's not enough to attack. That's only a total of 40 pilots. Cartel, what do you suggest?&quot;
<br />&quot;We need to ally with someone. A strong military faction to keep us safe until we can get back up on our feet&quot;.
<br />&quot;Who do you suggest?&quot; asked Orillion.
<br />&quot;Someone close to hear, someone we can count on... It can't be a house faction. I know! How about the Corsairs?&quot;
<br />&quot;Do you think we can trust a bunch of criminals?&quot; asked Orillion
<br />&quot;Yes. Well, at least these guys. My uncle was a Corsair. I'm sure my ties could help.&quot;
<br />&quot;It's settled then,&quot; said Orrilion &quot;Contact your uncle and tell him to meet us on the Luxury Liner Hawaii.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes sir&quot;.
<br />&quot;Green, what is the best way to get there?&quot;
<br />&quot;A new jump hole formed just east of here headed for Sigma 17. I had some weapons platforms put there just in case. It is fairly young, but should be stable enough for the Osiris.&quot;
<br />&quot;It's settled then. We shall meet on board the Osiris at 19:00 hours. Dissmissed&quot;
<br />
<br />   And as planned, the Osiris went through the jumphole and pulled up near the Hawaii. A small shuttle transported Orillion and Cartell over. After some intense negotiations, a pact was formed between the Order, and the Corsairs. In exchange for the Corsar's protection, the Order would offer equipment and base usage.
<br />
<br />More soon

			<div class="content">Nice Fanfic! Your Story has potential!!!
<br />
<br />Now I'll give you a little constructive feedback (I hope).
<br />
<br />1.) You are a little to fast with the Story: What you have written so far, would be a good Introduction into the story, but not 2 full chapters (in my opinion)
<br />
<br />2.) Please describe the things more detaild:
<br />Time         - How much time has past since the end of the game
<br />Equipment - Your story plays in the future, describe possible advancments and other things that have changed since the end of the game
<br />Ships         - Describe the Nomad mothership and other ships that may be in the mod, but not in the original game
<br />Planets      - If there are any new ones
<br />Battles      - Brings more Atmosphere in the story
<br />Character  - Bring in Characters and describe them (why do they do, what they do; where are they from; etc...
<br />
<br />That should be enough feedback for now.
<br />
<br />Keep it up and write more.</div>

<br />PART 2 - NOMAD INVASION OF THE BORDER WORLDS
<br />
<br />The Corsairs and The Order have been able to keep a hold on Omicron Minor for a good amount of time now, about 9 months after &quot;the raid&quot;. Things, however, have been going from bad to worse. The Nomads went from sending small fighters, to sending Battleship and Fighter patrols, to sending massive portions of their fleet. With the Order nearly gone - a mear 9 pilots left, and the Corsairs starting to back ot of the deal, it seems as though hope is lost. It pretty much is.
<br />
<br />December 12th, it happened. The entire Nomad fleet, including the mothership, uncloaked at Toledo. The Corsairs and the Order knew that it was time to go. All remaining Order piltos borded the Osiris as it set out to find a new home. It made a new base in Omicron Gamma, in the Asteroid Belt near Tripoli Shipyard. The Nomads began flooding into the Border Worlds. One by one the bases fell, Malta, Cali, Crete, Tripoli Itself, The Hawaii, almost evertything gone. Leaving almost nothing behind. The Order and the Corsairs, the last factions in the Border Worlds, now must fight to keep all of Sirius from collpasing.
<br />
<br />Find out the solution on the next NOMAD TAKEOVERRRRRRR!!!!!!
