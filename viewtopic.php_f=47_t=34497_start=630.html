			<div class="content">Arilias, my post about prometheus was only meant as a joke. However, whether you reaize it or not the Genesis project is striaght out of Star Treck II: The Wrath of Kahn (I believe my fellow trekies can back me up on this). I remember this movie very well because it made me so mad when they killed of Spock (even if they did bring him back). In fact the planet where they left his body was the planet terraformed by the Genesis technology. Your delivery system is different but the concept is exactly the same.</div>

			<div class="content">*Somewhere in the deep space darkmatter clouds between kepler and galleio.*
<br />
<br />This is freelancer alpha 12-28 to navy command, no sign of the junker pirate, continuing pattern, wait.... something's wrong with space in front of.... OH GOD! This is freelancer alpha 12-28, I need immediate assistan---- *Line goes static.*
<br />
<br />*Bridge of the LFS-Kep Salu*
<br />
<br />Damm, I wish we didn't have to do that, but this yard must be kept secret. What is the current report from New america and Pan America (Our new system. New america is off cortez in the dark matter cloud zone edges. Pan america is out in the boundry nebula hispainia way. Oh, and I didn't engage the main rhineland fleet, we flew around it and hit and ran on the convoy.)
<br />
<br />*Aide steps up to the command chair.* Sir, evac has been completed. Our scientists report that Seattle and Lousiana have been equipped with thrusters and the AM reducer coils. They should be moved soon. Boston is almost to the hole. We managed to connive agiera into giving us two of their Idun shields and have placed them on New Richmond and Philidelphia. It should protect them from the blast should an enemy fleet jump in and we have to detonate the  completed system wide minefield. Rhineland is reportedly moving against us, and the hunters have refused our offer of a square, fair fight.
<br />
<br />*Richardson ponders this for a moment, then goes on to more pressing matters.* What about this new Jump Envelope technology that our scientists have supposedly stumbled across?
<br />
<br />*Aide checks his notes.* Yes, we got it installed before we left dock. Basicly, from what they say, it allows us to generate a small pocket of jumphole space around a ship, and from intital reports, the ship managed to travel to cortez and back, they start to get hard to understand at this point.....
<br />
<br />*Ponders hard over this* When will our first commitment class hybrid ship be done? Also, can you tell me when they hope to destroy the jump hole re-router in New america? We need to hurry.
<br />
<br />*Aide checks clipboard again.* Well, boston should be through at any second and shipped to the asteroid belt in the Pan america system between montreal and Hudson. Also, so you don't ask, they have already set up docking rings in orbit of both planets from pre-fab kits, and they have put up a mining platform. *Checks his clipboard for anything else he is missing.* Hmmm, we may no longer need to worry about being discovered on our raids. Our scientists have found an interesting use for the jump envelope technology. Apparently, within a distance of 2 lightyears, it can be used to remotely pull goods into jump space and return them to the initiating ship. Some genius tried it with one of the asteroids in the belt and nearly got squished. * A package is delivered to him* Um, sir, here is your detonator for the New america mines.
<br />
<br />*Richardson picks up the detonator, designed like one of the plunger style blasting boxes used  before space travel.* Excellent. Tell the first taskforce to remain guarding the starbase construction facility, and we'll take the pass out and back to new america. We'll use the envelope.
<br />
<br />*Checks something.* Sir, we're going to need more permenant protection for the site, it's going to take a while to complete.
<br />
<br />Damm. Arrange for the constitution to get off guard duty to deliver some weapon platform kits, and see about harvesting some of the darkmatter to convert into anti-matter for our new torpedos. We're running out of warheads.
<br />*The LFS Kep Salu activates it's drive, and  drops into a jumphole- like singularity. Space shimmers as the envelope of jump space shoots away.*

<br />
<br />Today, rhineland, and liberty forces are baffled by the mysterious dissapearances of goods. They suspect the rogues, but are currently unable to pin anything on them, as all sightings of the ships were a system away from the sites when the dissapearances occured. In ther news, the rogues have broadcast an offical declaration of intent to &quot;End the Axis/Alliance war by any humane means possible. They have also shot back at liberty command saying that they, like the hispanic alliance, have not trafficed drugs or artifacts since the near beginning of the war, and in fact have repented of their ways and some of their top leaders are willing to stand trial when the war has been stopped and liberty freed from oppressive martial law. 
<br />
<br />We will provide more information as the story unfolds.
<br />
<br />=End of broadcast.=
<br />
<br />*New america system, ort cloud.*
<br />
<br />Sir, we're in place. Seattle and Lousiana are through the hole and the router has been destroyed. Richmond and Philidelphia have been secured and are being prepped for the move, if we can manage it. We're sending Richmond through first. I hope to envelope can get big enough, even with 12 generators working on the problem. *The aide pulls away to check on other trouble spots.*
<br />
<br />Begin the procedure.* Richardson pleads with god for this crazy, whacked out idea to work. It begins fine, richmond easing into the humongous hole, but then, things go horribly wrong, the hole collapses on a tenth of richmond, the tectonic pressures released shatter the planet, sending fragments hurling towards the Kep Salu, Philedelphia, and anyone remaining in the system. The inner system minefield is disrupted greatly. 1500 technicians and some of the rogues best scientists have just died.* WHAT IN THE NAME OF HELL JUST HAPPENED!?
<br />
<br />*The scientist in charge of the experiment/ evac turns his head to richardson.* From the looks of things, we aimed too big. Even with a marc for every envelope generator, the fields were too massive and power consuming. And richmond was half the size of philidelphia. There is no way we'll be able to get it through.
<br />
<br />*Outraged.* YES, YOU WILL FIND A WAY TO GET IT THROUGH IF YOU HAVE TO PUT 10 MARCS TO EVERY GENERATOR! FAIL AGAIN AND YOU'LL BE ON THE SHOCK SQUADRONS! Get out of my sight. *Last was deadly cold.*
<br />
<br />Yes, sir. But, I doubt even 20 marcs to a generator is going to work.
<br />
<br />
<br />Then do a hundred.
<br />
<br />But sir, the heat generated could make the surface uninhabitable.
<br />
<br />Get IT THROUGH. Consult with agiera if you have to, but get the damm planet through.*Shoves the man into one of the lifts.*
<br />
<br />Sir, we were right, our hole was unstable, it just collapsed. Only way in is by artifical holes or rifts, or our envelope. 
<br />
<br />Good, let them come. I'm ready to sacrifice this system if it means that their fleets are diminished. Send word to the Reliant, Mobile and Atlanta to tow the junker bases through jump envelopes to Pan america.
<br />
<br />*Aide writes the orders down.* Refit the junker fleet when it arrives and have them assist in building up mining operations and let them borrow Lousiana until they build their own shipyard?
<br />
<br />Yes. Get me a notepad.
<br />
<br />*Top secret message sent to New Albany by means of the reliant*
<br />
<br />When you get this message, you will be within moments of being brought to the Pan America system for refit and upgrading. Unfortunately, Richmond was destroyed when we tried to move it to Pan America, but you will be offered hudson. We ask in return that you form A &quot;Peace Leauge&quot; with us to combat the coming storms of the axis and alliance's coming second onslaught. We also ask that you help us with stripping the resources from New America with several new technologies from us. However, we must ask that any ship equipped with these new technologies self-destruct before they are captured or destroyed, as these new systems could be a great hazard to us should they fall into either side's hands. We will let you borrow our new shipyard, &quot;Louisiana&quot; Until you can build your own shipyard. 
<br />
<br />President Richardson
<br />
<br />*Top secret message delivered to King of bretionia.*
<br />
<br />I would like to ask you if you could arrange safe passage for myself and ym flagship to New London to discuss my wishes, so that you may better understand the grave problem the axis/alliance war presents to the continueing future of mankind. If you grant me passage and sactuary for my stay, I will keep my ship's weapons and shields powered down as a gesture of peace to bretonia and her people. Please reply by means of the messanger your answer.
<br />
<br />
<br />*Rogue congress meeting.*
<br />
<br />Mr. President, if what you want is passed, we will no longer be the same people we are today, a large portion of what we stand for will be lost to this cause.
<br />
<br />Sir, what you say will be lost now was lost long ago when we began our quest to change liberty back to what it should truely be. Our actions in our former existance were wrong, and the only reason we have begun any type of action resembiling that previous life is because we must stop the supplys in order to stop the war. Choke the Axis, and Alliance war machines to death, and we have easy access to Liberty and our final mission. The name change is mearly the final declaration of intent to prove we are committed to the course.
<br />
<br />Fine then, I cannot hold my vote against you then if what you say is true. Motion ratified, 26 to 25 to formally change our mission and name to become the Liberty Reform Force. And may god have mercy on our souls. We'll dispatch our envelope capible fighters to begin exploring the surrounding systems soon.
<br />
<br />Thank you, members of congress, your support has helped finally fix our purpose and resolve. Let us hope something worthwhile greets us in our neighbooring systems.
<br />
<br />
<br />=LRF news network= *One week after name change.*
<br />
<br />With the formation of the exploration fleet, hopefully we can begin to come up to level with the powerplant houses, and hopefully form a symbol of peace and prosperity through more enlightened ways. In other news, our old allys, the junkers rejoining us has been recepted well by the public, and hopefully we can provide them shelter and safe haven until they can assist us in our fight to bring peace to sirus and especially our true home, and hope, liberty.
<br />
<br />In other news, our new envelope drive is confounding both sides of the conflict. Some of their experts are blaming everything from mini-black holes evaportating, to freak jump hole shifts, to the other side's sabatoge, but the high commands are conviced it is us, but how they don't have a clue how we do our job. In related news, we have recently stolen from a convoy of hispania transports bound for their major positions. Inital estimates are that we have enough weapons to completely mine Pan America and New America strongly enough so that even with the complete set-off of all anti-matter mines, a second round of these stolen missles, mines and fuel could still do heavy damage to a second fleet wave. LRF command says they intend to lure several fleets to new america and detonate the mines. It is hoped that with the mines 5 k assured destruction range, the mines will not be noticed until they explode.
<br />
<br />We know this course of action is despicible, however, we cannot stand up to them in a straight fight yet, and we must do all we can to weaken them until we can end this on terms favorable to all. 
<br />
<br />LRF news signing off.
<br />
<br />=Broadcast ends.=
<br />
<br />(OOC: Like the news guys said, we're all packed up in Pan america and got the trigger finger on the mines, just waiting for you guys to run into new america thinking it was our central system. Go ahead, you can try to see our mines and escape, but they're one for every 5 cubic k and cloaked semi-well. And I intend to indeed cut off supplies. The envelope system needs work though, but you can still catch a fighter brigade or two if you're lucky. Just a little something to spice things up. And yes, whoever is working on the list of systems, add Pan america to the rogues systems, change the HQ to Montreal, and change the name to LRF)

<br />Now I have RH and the BHG?
<br />DSQrn, why did you abandon me???
<br />
<br />@OC- I am sorry, but since I called Blitzkrieg, I cannot pull out of your system.  Also, your jumpdrives CANNOT go long distances, I am officially sanctioning that rule.  
<br />The rule is:
<br />Use of jumpdrives, rifters, etc. are limited in their jump capabilities.  YOU MAY ONLY JUMP TO A NEIGHBORING SYSTEM, OR BETWEEN SYSTEMS IN THE SAME GROUP.  (ie- Rheinland, Omegas, Sigmas, Omicrons, Iotas/New Greece.  Therefore, you must own either 
<br />a) a system in the group you want to go to, or 
<br />b) a system neighboring to the system you want to go to.  
<br />
<br /><i> Rheinland Leader Dies!  </i>  DSQrn, the Chancellor of Rheinland, died today of unknown causes.  His will has been found, and on it, it says that he gives command of the House of Rheinland over to ww2jacob, the BHG leader.  Once doctors examine the body, they will be able to determine what killed him.  A day of mourning has been declared throughout all of the Axis.
<br /><i> New House Formed!  </i>  In his first act of command of the BHG and RH, ww2jacob has melded the two factions together into one.  The new faction is called House New Rheinland, and it will consist of the former BHG and Old Rheinland Empires.
<br />
<br />TO ROUGES:
<br />I am now the leader of New Rheinland, and I wish to offer you a deal.  We will leave you in peace, if you will leave us in peace.  We do not wish to fight you, so I will withdraw my threats to attack you, if you stop attacking us, and leave us be.
<br />
<br />TO GMG:
<br />We will assist you in this, and we did see the video.  Fortunatly, we have discovered a way to counter this.  We are sending ships to aide you.
<br />
<br />Technologies:
<br />Jumpdrive research compleated!
<br />Research begun on (Confidential) Project.
<br />
<br />New Ships:
<br />HG-
<br />To all SF systems
<br />500 Phal
<br />4000 wngs Hop
<br />To Omicron Theta:
<br />500 U WS
<br />900 WS
<br />800 C-Ships
<br />1000 wngs GrW
<br />
<br />DSQrn, could you post your current ships and bases here?</div>

			<div class="content">(OOC: I found a reason not to go long distances with the drive, and why I should not use the remote retrival system from anywhere over 1/2 lightyears, which increases your chances of getting to chase me. If you noticed, the drive failed, and trust me, it will never work on something that size, it just takes more power than anyone can produce and if we could produce enough power, it would melt the surface of any planet we tried to send the scientist guy was right. We only wanted to evac the planet and would never have used it as a doomsday device.)
<br />
<br />*Message to leader of new rhineland*
<br />
<br />We will only leave you in peace once this insane war of power and greed is settled fairly for all parties involved. Also, when we work to reform liberty, KEEP out. We will not rest until then. I will consider a possible confrence to discuss why I have these two points if you are perplexed. Also, you will not get our new technologys at all. Consider that a warning. Our ships will self-destruct if you attempt to capture or disable them to analize the drives. And they are powered by antimatter. 
<br />
<br />Keep these things in mind chancellor. We will not engage your fleets, we will not kill your people, we will only take them prisoner as war participants and treat them fairly. We will only take your war supplys until you are unable to fight. If it makes you feel any better, hispania is reciving the same treatment.

			<div class="content">yeah you know this tech thing is getting out of hand...I believe we can trace this to the prometheus idea (no offence Arilias)...and now people are kinda going WAY over the top with new technologies (hint hint OC and Richardson).  This needs to be kept to a minimum.  All of this super weapon stuff...no.  This doesn't work.  Otherwise everyone takes this thing out of hand and well the ending result isn't pretty and fairly quite childish.  Don't let losses drive you into desperation.  And Axis leaders, don't you start this too.  Jacob, seeing as you're probably in charge with DSQrn not around as much anymore, I think you can decide when someone's going over-the-top.
<br />
<br />We mourn the loss of DSQrn.  Wilde, GMG Presiding Leader, will be attending the funeral in person.  No pies involved.</div>

<br />
<br />We have aboslutely NO intention of taking over the houses, even liberty. we got involved in this war because it is tearing apart the systems, and you are heading to the point of no return where you will destroy the human race. Anyone who is participating in this war is having their war supplys raided. Any supplys for any other purpose are bing left alone. And you are in no position to be talking about the dismantling of fleets rhineland. At last count you possesed more ships than any other power in this war, most destructive warships with no other purpose than to bring pain and annialation. We at least have a secondary idea for what to do with our fleet after we reform liberty. Also, are you willing to be held accountable for killing with a massive weapon compareably to the WMD's of old earth? Are you willing to pay for the total destruction of the leeds system? You are as much a group of terrorists and criminals as house hispania. At least they acted out of need rather than greed.
<br />
<br />We will send the flagship LFS Kep Salu to your rendevous with myself aboard. Do not attempt to invade our system, as you will be dealt with in extreme force. We will not be proud to do so, but we will crush your fleet if that is what it takes.
<br />
<br />Prove to us that you can be committed to peace, do not slay those you capture, and rebuild what you have destroyed, and we will begin to rethink our opinion of you.  
<br />
<br />Richardson out.
<br />
<br /> Captain of the Kep Salu
<br />
<br />Trekkie and proud of it!</div>
