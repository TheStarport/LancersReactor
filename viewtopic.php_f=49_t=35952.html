			<div class="content">The town of Coffersville, was like most any other. It had it&#8217;s highs and it&#8217;s  lows. The Coffersville college was no exception either. The campus, situated by the river on the eastern part of town, had many a students that had high ambitions and desires. To be the best at what ever they finally decided to be. That left a lot to choose from. It did have its roses though. 
<br />
<br />The campus was busy on Monday morning. Classes had just started for the fall quarter. Most of the student population, was from the town. The other part, were from the surrounding area. It wasn&#8217;t like it was a larger university, or offered any special courses. It was, for the most part, relaxed. There were the business degrees, the accounting studies, and others that would lead to good jobs. 
<br />
<br />It had no sports teams to speak of, other than Tennis. But, many found there little niche and fit in nicely. That included the young man headed down the main stairs toward the street. He was the campus photographer. He also did work for the local paper when he could get it. Looking through the lense of a camera was his passion. He took quite a few pictures that had received a good review among the staff and students. 
<br />
<br />He would shot almost anything or anyone. Corsair, though, was one that did not appreciate having his picture taken. Not that he was shy, but, more that he believed no one could get his &#8220;good&#8221; side. He would give Ben hard time, sometimes playing tricks on him, like hiding his equipment. But, Ben never seemed to let this bother him. He had his eye on a flower that he waned to shoot. He just needed the right location. But the problem was, she was never in the right place. 
<br />
<br />Bethany was the quiet type, never wanting to be out in front. She sat in the back of class and meetings. She also worked at the paper with Ben. They had worked together on pieces, she writing the articles and him taking the pictures to go with it. He just could never work up the nerve to take her picture when they were alone. But, between the job and school, he did not have to much free time to chose from.
<br />
<br />The morning had him all over the campus snapping shots of the new teach3ers and some of the students for the monthly publication. He was proud of the work he put out. His was some spectacular shots and some, wondered how he got th shots. The angles looked as though it would take someone climbing walls to get them. That he reminded himself, was a trade secret that he told no one. He smiled at the thought. He grabbed his bag and headed to Lit class. He was not as fond of it, but it was required for his degree. So, he trudged on through it. He grades were in the 3.75 range and better. 
<br />
<br />His home was the dorm room. It was set to his preferences. Cosy and all. Computer set on the back wall so he could look out of the window. He was able to get sm incredible pictures from there.</div>

			<div class="content">His home was the dorm room. It was set to his preferences. Cosy and all. Computer set on the back wall so he could look out of the window. He was able to get some incredible pictures from there. There was a board mounted over the bed with numerous pictures of prize shots that he kept. He wanted to put them in a scrap book to protect them, but, for now, he just enjoyed looking at them. He wanted to be a freelance photographer more than anything, but his parents made sure he had a full education first. After all, you would need it in the business world, weather selling a picture, or in marketing yourself.
<br />
<br />Another student new to the campus, Dick De Boom from the Netherlands, transferred in. His specialty was Japanese culture and history. He was staying a year to get his core classes before moving on to another university. He too loved to walk the campus. He enjoyed the beauty of the flowers in the spring. He was seen on the quad studying often. Ben noticed one day and snapped a few shots to add to the school news letter. Ben swung around for any other shots that were here. He lined up on one of the new teachers, but froze. Bethany was talking to the teacher now. He lost track of the shot and set the camera down on the table.
<br />
<br />Breakfast in the central hall was as much fun as a wall of jello, but, if you did eat, that was where you headed first thing. Some of the student got their food and headed back to their rooms, in spite of the rules against it. Ben was pretty much the same. But today, he grabbed a plate of pancakes and some eggs and sat at the TV and watched the news. Some story was on, but it was the pictures being used that intrigued him the most. They were shot like he was learning to take. Well, he had hope for a career then.
<br />
<br />Dick walked in then and picked up some fruit, juice and milk and asked Ben, &#8220;Mind if I sit here?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Ben looked up from the TV and nodded. Dick pulled the chair out and slid his tray onto the table. After opening his carton of milk and setting it down, he reached for his orange juice and took a sip. He asked Ben what was so good on the news. Ben turned back to Dick and said it was the quality of the pictures that the new service was using. He explained that he wanted to be in that position one day, to be in demand for his work. Dick thought for a moment, then replied, &#8220;Well, if your that good you will be&#8221; his smile was infectious. Ben smiled as well, and said he hoped his was that good, one day. For now, he loved taking pictures for the school and the local paper.
<br />History class was a pain today. They decided to change topics and dove head first into Japanese history. It was an area that Ben was weakest. He wasn&#8217;t sure he could pass muster in this one, at least, not with out help. He would have to look for a tutor to help him this time. He had enough money to pay for one. The pictures he sold the paper helped with his school expenses. But, who would he find that could help. He headed to the quad again. It was almost empty, except for some girls engaged in small talk, and Dick. He headed over and said Hi. Dick looked up from his books and returned the Hi. He motioned for Ben to have a seat and asked what was up.
<br />
<br />After half an hour of explaining the situation, the long way, Dick had a grin spread on his face. This made Ben ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s so funny&#8221;. Dick explained the studies he had back home before transferring and also where he was headed to learn more. This might just turn into an opportunity that Ben sought for. He asked what was the charge for tutoring him, and Dick said, if Ben would teach him to use a camera well, they could call it an even trade.

			<div class="content">After half an hour of explaining the situation, the long way, Dick had a grin spread on his face. This made Ben ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s so funny&#8221;. Dick explained the studies he had back home before transferring and also where he was headed to learn more. This might just turn into an opportunity that Ben sought for. He asked what was the charge for tutoring him, and Dick said, if Ben would teach him to use a camera well, they could call it an even trade.
<br />
<br />Saturday rolled around fast. Ben was waiting in the quad for Bethany. They were headed for a walk along the river. It was a beautiful, sunny day. He breeze just wisping the leaves, as the robins sung along. Nature in harmony. Bethany strolled up with two bottles of water. And they headed towards the river dock. It was the best place o start the tour. The wild flowers were so beautiful, that you could not help but to stop and admire them, or at least take a whiff of the wonderful fragrance they had.
<br />
<br />The river was quiet today,, not more than a stream is speed, about thirty feet wide, and they said somewhere around fifteen feet deep. It was still cold for a dip, but in a few more months, it would be perfect.
<br />
<br />The dock, small and un pretentious, was a perfect place to just sit and relax. Ben loved to kick his shoes off and let his feet stir the water. The small minnows would circle and he managed to get a few good pictures of them and a turtle that decided to take a look around.
<br />
<br />Bethany put her arm around Ben as they walked. She loved the times they could spend together. She wanted more times, but settled for those thy had, and made the best of it. He always had his camera with him, which got between them sometimes, but she settled in to the fact he love what he did and wanted to be the best at it. If it meant sharing hm with a camera, she would do it. She loved him very much and would do what she could to help him succeed. 
<br />
<br />Thirty minuets into the walk, they came to some violet flowers that grew hanging out over the river, and Ben saw a perfect shot. It would be perfect for the paper n the home and garden section. They paid five dollars a shot for his picture. It wasn&#8217;t much money, but paid for the film and developing and helped him get exposer as a good photographer. He hoped, one day, to land that perfect job.
<br />
<br />An hour later, they headed back to the campus. They had friends meeting them for lunch and needed to get changed to head to the Pizza Restaurant. It was the college hang out, and had good food. On the way back to his dorm, Ben passed Professor Ed Indy. He was teaching social studies this year, and Ben had him in his third class of the day. Ed seemed to have something on his ind, as he did not see Ben until he nearly ran him down. After apologizing, Ed headed off to his office, he had also asked Ben to stop by latter, if he had time. 
<br />
<br />Ben tried to turn it over in his mind, but could not think what his teacher could possibly want, but, he set about getting ready and would ask Bethany&#8217;s opinion later. She seemed to have her ways of finding things out. Her nose for news and answers was astounding. That would lead her far in the journalism field. He just wanted to be there with her.</div>
