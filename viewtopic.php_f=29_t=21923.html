			<div class="content">CREATING GUNS AND MISSILES TUTORIAL
<br />
<br />Ok... I wanted to show a way to modify some missiles and guns so everyone could understand the methodology.  These examples also show you how to make them mount on any weapon mount.  You should download these programs from the editing utilities forum...
<br />
<br />bini lite or bini.exe
<br />fled_ids
<br />Also handy to have to see all the ids numbers is FreelancerMiscDataBase.xls, you can put in your new numbers too!
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />You will modify these files in the Freelancer\data\equipment directory: 
<br />
<br />weapon_equip.ini &lt;---describes what the weapon is and what it does
<br />weapon_good.ini &lt;---tells Freelancer it is available for sale and what it costs
<br />market_misc.ini  &lt;---lets you put the weapon up for sale at a particular location
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The first (bini lite.exe) will let you change your weapon_equip.ini (or any other of the .ini files in the game) into a readable text file which you can edit. Always without fail backup your original file before you rename the created text file to an .ini file. That is, when you ask bini lite to decrypt the file it will not change the original... it will make a new text file that you will later re-name to an .ini file when you are finished modding it and wish to use it in the game.  Make the old file &quot;weapon_equip.ini.bak&quot; for instance, or weapon_equip.ini.old or follow whatever convention you see fit, but use the same method on all the backed up files for consistency's sake.
<br />
<br />You will begin I suppose, by examining the files. You will see that every gun file has two parts... the munition it fires and the gun itself. For the weapon we chose, the munition part reads like this... 
<br />
<br />[Munition ;&lt;----be careful to put the closing bracket here, they do not show up on this forum but they have to be there!
<br />nickname=li_gun01_mark01_ammo ;&lt;---change to whatever you like, we used &quot;longsword_ammo&quot; in this example. 
<br />hp_type=hp_gun
<br />requires_ammo=false
<br />hit_pts=2
<br />hull_damage=16.3  ;&lt;---yeah... this is how much hurt it puts out!
<br />energy_damage=0  ;&lt;---shields will be damaged by whatever is here plus half the hull damage figure... this would be 8 in game
<br />weapon_type=W_Laser01
<br />one_shot_sound=fire_laser1
<br />munition_hit_effect=li_laser_01_impact
<br />const_effect=li_laser_01_proj  ;&lt;---this is what the &quot;projectile&quot; will look like in the game.  You can change it from another gun
<br />lifetime=0.8
<br />force_gun_ori=false
<br />mass=1
<br />volume=0.0001
<br />
<br />And so we could make it...
<br />
<br />[Munition ;&lt;----Again... be careful to put the closing bracket here.
<br />nickname=gun_longsword_ammo  
<br />hp_type=hp_gun
<br />requires_ammo=false
<br />hit_pts=2
<br />hull_damage=100
<br />energy_damage=50 
<br />weapon_type=W_Laser01
<br />one_shot_sound=fire_laser1
<br />munition_hit_effect=li_laser_01_impact
<br />const_effect=li_laser_01_proj  
<br />lifetime=1.00
<br />force_gun_ori=false
<br />mass=1
<br />volume=0.0001
<br />
<br />
<br />and the actual gun section...
<br />
<br />[Gun ;&lt;----again, make sure the bracket is closed
<br />nickname=li_gun01_mark01 ;&lt;---make the change to &quot;longsword&quot; here, without the quote marks of course.
<br />ids_name=263357 ;&lt;---you will want to change this number to 320003 to preserve the old weapon 
<br />ids_info=264357  ;&lt;---ditto for this number.  Change to 321003 for this example
<br />DA_archetype=equipment\models\weapons\li_heavy_ion_blaster.cmp
<br />material_library=equipment\models\li_equip.mat
<br />HP_child=HPConnect
<br />hit_pts=400 ;&lt;---I would pump this up to about 4000 so they won't come apart at the wrong time, but hey...  that's just me. 
<br />explosion_resistance=1
<br />debris_type=debris_normal
<br />parent_impulse=20
<br />child_impulse=80
<br />volume=0
<br />mass=10
<br />hp_gun_type=hp_gun_special_1  ;&lt;---you could add more mounts and mount to any weapon mount...  see below
<br />damage_per_fire=0
<br />power_usage=5.09
<br />refire_delay=0.1012
<br />muzzle_velocity=800
<br />use_animation=Sc_fire
<br />toughness=1.3
<br />flash_particle_name=li_laser_01_flash
<br />flash_radius=15
<br />light_anim=l_gun01_flash
<br />projectile_archetype=li_gun01_mark01_ammo

<br />auto_turret=false
<br />turn_rate=90
<br />lootable=true
<br />LODranges=0, 20, 40, 80, 100
<br />
<br />And so the gun becomes...
<br />
<br />[Gun ;&lt;----again, make sure the bracket is closed

<br />ids_info=321003

<br />flash_radius=15
<br />light_anim=l_gun01_flash

<br />separation_explosion=sever_debris
<br />auto_turret=false
<br />turn_rate=90
<br />lootable=true
<br />LODranges=0, 20, 40, 80, 100
<br />
<br />As you see you can make sense out of most of it but there are a few things to know that are not obvious. 
<br />
<br />1. The shield (energy) damage is half the hull damage if you do not put anything in the energy_damage slot. Here we see the hull damage is 16.3 (will be 16 in the game) and the shield damage listed as energy damage will be 8 in the game. However if you put an entry in the shield (energy) damage section, then it will also take on half of the hull damage figure as well... Thus if you put in say, 20 for energy damage, it will also take 8 more (or half of the hull damage) and show up as 28 in the game, whereas hull damage would still be 16... strange huh...!
<br />
<br />2. Also note the lifetime figure. Here it is 0.8 or 8 10ths of a second. That is how long the &quot;blast&quot; lives after being fired. Now if in the gun section below the munition section the muzzle_velocity is listed as 800 you will get a &quot;range&quot; figure of 640 in the game (.8*800=640) So if you wanted to increase the range of your weapon to say 800m then you would modify either the lifetime to 1.0 or the velocity to 1000. If you changed them both to those figures (lifetime of 1.0 and velocity of 1000) then you gun would have a range of 1000m at a velocity of 1000m/s... see? Look at the section above to see what I mean. There you also see the ids_name and ids_info numbers I refered to earlier. The hit points in this section only refer to how much damage your weapon can take before being disabled, not how much it can dish out, but it would be prudent to pump this figure up some (say triple it or more!) if you cruise around in radiation fields or get shot at a lot.
<br />
<br />3. hp_gun_type= refers to the type of hard point the gun is mounted on and gives the level of the gun. This says hp_gun_special_1 This is the lowest level for a gun. If you changed it to 10 your gun would be a level 10 gun but you couldn't buy it until your character had got to level 26 or so. Therefore leave that part alone if you want to be able to use the gun from the beginning of the game. You will also note that there are turret and torpedo hard points in the game as well. You may want to modify a turret gun like li_turret01_mark01 to have a &quot;set&quot; of guns you will use in the game.
<br />
<br />There are three more important stats that your gun has that you will want to modify.
<br />
<br />4. Power useage... this determines how much power the gun uses every time it spits out a pulse. If this number is high, you will always be running out of power in a prolonged fight. I would lower it to a modest amount with heavier weapons, say 3 or 4. 5 is probably ok for this weapon but some level 8 and above guns can run you out of power quickly and those are the ones I would be most concerned with. You could, of course, also modify the ships power output but that is beyond the scope of this reply, but easily done.
<br />
<br />5. Modify the refire rate. Seen here as refire_delay=0.1012. This shows how many times per second this gun will fire. 1 / .1012 will yeild about 9.88 times per second. This is pretty brisk! You may find yourself blinded by muzzle flash and unable to hit the target if this figure is set too high. .125 will yeild 8 shots per second, .25 = 4 shots, and .5 = 2 shots etc. The idea is to get your weapon to output a certain amount of power per second, and then cut it up into managable slices or shots per second. For instance a level 10 gun puts out a total power output of about 2200 units per second. Most of the level 10 guns fire only 2 times per second, so that would mean a hull damage of about 1100 and shield damage (energy damage) of 550 per shot. You have to be very accurate to hit with a 2 per second pulse rate, so I would pump that up to 4 or 8 but cut back the damage per pulse proportionately. Thus at 8 per/sec it would be 2200 * .125 or 275 per pulse @ 8 per/sec for hull damage and 137 for shield damage. I would set the energy damage figure to 138 to start with(remember... the shield damage will always add half the hull damage to itself), so when the gun fires in the game it would have 275 hull and 275 shield damage for a nifty 10+ level output gun. See? Of course a good starting weapon would be about 1/4 that output and you could probably get through the whole game with one set to 8 pulses per/sec with 100 hull and 100 shield damage per pulse a range of 1000m at a velocity of 1000m/s. That would be a formidable gun. Matched with an equally formidable turret you would be one tough cookie! You could experiment with the power level of the turret(s) pumping up the shield damage, for instance, to really pull their pants down so to speak.
<br />
<br />6. Make sure the ammo type is reflected in the gun section.  If you don't do this you can modify the ammo all you want but the gun will shoot the original ammo and not your new stuff.  It is the 6th line from the bottom of the gun section.  Thus, the line: 
<br />projectile_archetype=li_gun01_mark01_ammo 
<br />has to be changed to: 
<br />projectile_archetype=gun_longsword_ammo
<br />
<br />The second program, fled_ids, lets you look at the ids_name and ids_info numbers you will find in you weapon_eqip.ini file and allow you to change the information displayed on the screen for the weapon you are modding, thus changing the name from Justice mark 1 to Longsword (or anything you want...  like MuiCrushero...hey, I'm not in marketing, that's someone else!) or make a new weapon. 
<br />
<br />The Justice mark 1 will appear as 263357 or li_gun01_mark01 in the weapon_equip.ini. You would simply enter that ids_name... 263357 into the appropriate box in the Fled_ids program and press the button &quot;get ids_name&quot; and it will show you &quot;Justice Mark I&quot; on the screen. You could simply rename it to whatever you want by overwritting it with say... &quot;Longsword&quot; on the Fled_ids screen and clicking on the &quot;save ids_name&quot; button and it would forever after be seen as a Longsword on the right side of your equipment dealer's screen when you go to buy weapons. A better way would be to change the number entirely to say... 320003 ( which is an empty number slot in the 4th DLL... more on that further down)  and record the information as described.  
<br />
<br />Then you need to change the information that shows up when you click on the weapon in the dealer's screen by modifying the ids_info (which happens to be 264357... or 1000 more than the ids_name number, you could change this to 321003 to use a new number and not overwrite anything, so preserving the old weapon as well as creating a new one.) also using the fled_ids program and the second box where you would input that number which is listed in your decrypted weapon_equip.ini file. It will show a bunch of information which looks like this...
<br />
<br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-16&quot;?&gt;&lt;RDL&gt;&lt;PUSH/&gt;&lt;TRA data=&quot;1&quot; mask=&quot;1&quot; def=&quot;-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;JUST loc=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt;R6-A &quot;Justice&quot; Liberty Laser Cannon Mk I&lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt; &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TRA data=&quot;0&quot; mask=&quot;1&quot; def=&quot;-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;JUST loc=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt;This is a laser-based weapon that provides a high refire rate at a reduced damage output. This weapon is most effective against positron shields, and weakest against graviton shields. &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt; &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;POP/&gt;&lt;/RDL&gt;
<br />
<br />Do not under any circumstances whatsoever modify anything other than the actual text of this infocard. That is, do not change anything other than the actual description of the weapon which comes after JUST loc=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt; and before &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt; or your onscreen infocard will be jumbled up. Then again a little farther on where it says &lt;TEXT&gt; again you can change the blurb about the weapon as well. So you might change it to look like this...
<br />
<br />&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-16&quot;?&gt;&lt;RDL&gt;&lt;PUSH/&gt;&lt;TRA data=&quot;1&quot; mask=&quot;1&quot; def=&quot;-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;JUST loc=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt;Longsword Improved Laser Cannon &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt; &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TRA data=&quot;0&quot; mask=&quot;1&quot; def=&quot;-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;JUST loc=&quot;left&quot;/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt;This is a laser-based weapon that provides a high refire rate and high damage output. It has an increased range as well and thus the name... This weapon is most effective against positron shields, and weakest against graviton shields. &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;TEXT&gt; &lt;/TEXT&gt;&lt;PARA/&gt;&lt;POP/&gt;&lt;/RDL&gt;
<br />
<br />You see... only change the stuff between the &lt;TEXT&gt; markers and you will be ok. 
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------multi-mount code below-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />As an aside, you can make your gun mountable just about anywhere by expanding the hp_gun_type= in the gun section to include all weapon mounts like this:
<br />
<br />hp_gun_type=hp_gun_special_1,hp_turret_special_1,hp_torpedo_special_1,hp_torpedo_special_2
<br />
<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />------------------------------------------------------------A new missile for your shooting pleasure----------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />You can do the same for missiles as this following example of my JSG Cudgel Missile shows...  The ids_name and ids_info are for an 8th DLL that I have added to my own mods, but you could use a free number in a weapon file and assign it with FLed-ids as talked about in the above section.  You would of course also have to make an entry into weapons_good_ini and then into market_misc.ini to make the weapon available, but more on that later. The Cannonball missile ammo ids_name was 265151, and the ids_info was 266151, whereas the launcher [gun for the Cannonball ids_name was 263151, and the ids_info was 264151.  You could use some logic and assign a new number to a current DLL using FLed-ids by using a little math. 
<br />
<br />There are 65536 numbers available in a DLL file.  Since the numbers indicated above are 266151 for the highest it would indicate that they are in DLL 4, which is the EquipResources.dll.  If you add 65535, or one short of 65536 which would put you in DLL 5, you come up with the last number in this dll or 327679.  The game designers did not use all those slots, so if we go back a couple of thousand numbers, say to 320001 for the ids_name, and 321001 for the ids_info you could start using them as legitimate numbers for your weapons mods.  So using 320001 for the ids_name and then putting in &quot;JSG industries Cudgel Missile Launcher&quot; and hitting &quot;save ids_name&quot; in FLed-ids will put that number into the 4th DLL.  Similarly, you could pull up the blurb from the original missile launcher for the ids_info by inputting 264151 in the ids_info box, click the &quot;Get ids_info button&quot; and modify the blurb as per instructions listed above this section, then change the ids_info number to the new one ( 321001) and save it (I usually change the number immediately so as to prevent boneheading the thing and overwriting info I don't want overwritten, backing up the EquipResources.dll file which resides in the exe directory of Freelancer before modification is the best safety valve).  Then do the same for the ammo part of this weapon using say, 320002 for the ids_name and 321002 for the ids_info, and you would have a new weapon and accompaning ammo.  It takes longer to describe it than to do it so try it and see! 
<br />
<br />You then make an entry into the weapons_good.ini like this... it is the convention to put it at the end of the file as the last entry. That makes it easy to find, and easy to group all your modified files  The same is true of all the modified files... put your stuff at the end.  This is copied from the existing cannonball missile file entry and then modified.  You will of course do the same things to the gun file above in order to have a good to sell in the market_misc.ini.  You simply copy the li_gun01_mark01 weapon_good_ini file entry using the find option under the edit menu, and copy it to the bottom of the file, make the necessary changes to the ids_name and ids_info sections, nickname and equipment= sections, and of course price= section and your good to go for the cannon...

<br />That being done only one more series of changes need be made to get your weapons in the game...  You must now add the weapons to the various locations where you wish to sell it.  You could simply copy and paste them to the bottom of each and all the various bases in the game, or you could be selective and put them only in a few places.  It is up to you.

<br />seeker_fov_deg=35 ;&lt;---the angle off the target you can be and still get a seek
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />This one is a little crazy - you can click right on them sometimes and not get a seek, but at the same time - I have missile turrets that work fine firing backwards...
<br />
<br />If anyone knows exactly how this variable works - I'd love to hear it...
<br />
<br />Any case - you can make it 180 and the missile will never lose it's target.
<br />Like in Xwing or Tie-Fighter - the missile will (given time) come back for another bite at the apple.

<br />max_angular_velocity=2.90333 ;&lt;---the force of turn vs. gravity or 2.9 g's I think.
<br /> <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />I'm pretty sure this is the Maximum Angular Velocity, it is measured in radians/second
<br />
<br />G-Forces are a measure of acceleration. To calculate it from angular velocity you need a few other variables, like mass and linear velocity.
