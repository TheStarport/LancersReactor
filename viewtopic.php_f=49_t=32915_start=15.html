			<div class="content">sycho_warrior loved to sit at her desk and write. The story she was working on was a good one. It was fiction, but it gave her a little more leeway with the story. It was called Reactor Adventures. It was set aboard a ship with two different classes of midshipmen. It was a tale of adventure and surprise. 
<br />	
<br />The back room in the of the Dry Gulch saloon was lit only by three lanterns. Most of the people present were in darkness. They had all waited till after dark to arrive. Secrecy was imperative. The map laid out on the saw horses could be seen by all. It was crudely drawn, but was sufficient for the task. The men assembled were a motley bunch. Mostly cutthroats that were needed for carrying a gun, nothing more. The leaders of this bunch were former military officers, some had been in the war of 1812. No one knew why all of this was happening, just that they would be payed very well if it all went off with out a hitch. An imposing man moved into the smokey light. His bearing was on of sharp cunning and determination. Someone you did not want to cross.
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;All right, lets get down to business&#8221; he said, his voice deep and foreboding. &#8220;Kelsy, you and your bunch will hold up here&#8221; he said pointing to a position on the map. &#8220;Clayton, you take your men to the depot, here&#8221; pointing to a location a little ways from the first. &#8220;Ike, you take your ten to the White ford junction, and wait for my telegraph&#8221; He spoke, looking Ike in the eye. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me down Ike, I won&#8217;t be as forgiving this time&#8221;. Ike looked at the floor, the map, anywhere but at this mans eyes. 
<br />
<br />The Forum was back in full swing. All the regulars were there, and all with one thing on their mind. What was going on? The gossip of the forum being closed and the Marshals being in town stirred memories of ten years ago, and that only got tongues wagging more. Esq started the first discussion asking if any one had seen Bargib lately. A couple of hands shot up and one replied that he had seen him with Fear Factor over at the livery stable. That got the background chatter up a bit. Esq asked if any other Marshals had been seen around. &#8220;Yeah, me&#8221; replied a voice at the swinging doors. Locutus walked in, rifle in hand, wearing two pistol holsters and two bandoleers of rifle ammo. That got everyone&#8217;s attention and a murmur started. Locutus, to everyone&#8217;s consternation, simply headed to a table occupied by Mustang and sat down.
<br />
<br />Wolfy was so tired tonight. He had wanted to stop at the Forum before heading home, but he still had to give sw a ride home. For some reason, it gave him butterflies in his stomach when he was around her. He like her as a friend, but had never got to know her better. He, after all had been her student not too many years ago. She was after all, four years older than him, wise in worldly things. But she had done a good job teaching him and he graduated, passing all his studies. He had to admit, he did like helping some of the other younger boys, as it gave him a chance to see sw more. It always got him to daydream of when he and Eh_Steve use to get into trouble and sw help calm things down. Ah, the good old days, he thought, grinning.
<br />
<br />Chips had completed his rounds and started back to the jail. He kept getting curious looks from towns folks. He looked down at the hardware he was wearing. Two pistols and a rifle the latter which he carried out. He had to admit, it seemed like over kill, and he worried about alarming people when he really could not say why he was armed this way. Bargib and Locutus had asked for volunteers and he had, so he had to keep to orders for now. He had to admit, it was going to be an honor, meeting someone so important as the President. 
<br />
<br />Dr. Taw and his Mrs were staying home tonight. He had been under the weather a bit lately and did not want to give Esq the pleasure of an &#8220;I told you so&#8221;.  He did like the quiet days, as he had need the time to heal from what he had experienced in the gold rush fever that had hit people. The death of pSYCHO had hit him even harder. He wanted so bad to change things, but knew he couldn&#8217;t. He had to move on. His wife was ever caring and supportive. Esq and the others had stopped by to offer heir support, but he was proud, and said he was ok. Esq, of all people, could see right though him. 
<br />
<br />The meeting had broken up and the man rolled up the map. &#8220;You must not fail in the objective&#8221; a voice from in the dark spoke. &#8220;There is much planning on what will happen&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know,&#8221; the man answered, &#8220; I have led men before and know how to accomplish the objective&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We, just want to make sure you know the consequences for failure&#8221; the voice spoke again and faded away. 
<br />
<br />To Be Continued

			<div class="content">&#8220;We, just want to make sure you know the consequences for failure&#8221; the voice spoke again and faded away. 
<br />
<br />Wizard was back At Bargib&#8217;s place. &#8220;Bargib, I got to tell you, this set up is a bit strange to me, I mean, using deputies as marshals and all&#8221;.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ya&#8217;ll are well trained and I trust you with my life&#8221; Bargib explained, &#8220;Besides, this is just for a week or so.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, you and Chips will have your hands full&#8221; Wizard said with a wink.
<br />
<br />Sw was full into her story. She loved writing almost as much as teaching. She paused to think about earlier when Wolfy had brought her home. He was real sweet, but her heart would not give in just yet, She would pray first. In the mean time, back to the story at hand.
<br />
<br />The candle light flickered on the hotel wall. Danced around to wicked patterns. Fear Factor was prepared for the task, but he was still unsure of the town. He and Locutus had information that no one else knew. But they had been instructed to reveal it only if needed, on an as needed basis. Knowing more would change the outcome, but it would save lives too. And that was worth the risk. He strapped on his holsters and grabbed the rifle and headed over to Bargib&#8217;s house to talk.
<br />
<br />Indy had his nose itch even more, so he headed to the place where he could find out things, the Forum. He saw Mustang at the back and headed over. &#8220;Pull up a chair Indy&#8221; Mustang said, signaling for another round.
<br />
<br />After about thirty minuets of small talk, Indy got around to hinting to what was going on. Mustang just downed his drink, got up and put his hat on, getting ready to leave. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t help you Indy, Bargib&#8217;s orders&#8221; he stated and headed up to the front to join Stinger who had been signaling. His rifle was on his shoulder as he turned and left. Indy watching and scratching his head. He had to figure it out. 
<br />
<br />Orillion was just locking up to head home when Boscoe rode up. &#8220;Evening Orillion&#8221; Boscoe called out.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Evening, Boscoe, long time no see&#8221; Orillion replied as the latch clicked. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yea, been busy out at the ranch, Mare&#8217;s gonna have a foal soon&#8221; Boscoe returned. His attention was now on something down the street. Orillion turned to look and saw Locutus waving to Boscoe to head over. &#8220;Talk to you later, Orillion&#8221; Boscoe said as he turned his horse towards the Jail. Orillion just stood there, a look of wonder on his face, Oh well, he figured, might as well head home. 
<br />
<br />An hour later, all were in the jail. Locutus had some plans spread out on the desk. It had taken a bit of arguing with Fear Factor to get him to agree to this. &#8220;All right, even though this is against my better judgement&#8221; Locutus said, glaring at FF, &#8220;Here is what&#8217;s believed to be going on.&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Over the next two hours, Locutus laid out the plan some people had to kill the President. It was apart of a much larger plan that was not clear at the time. That was why there was such secrecy, to keep information from getting back to the wrong people. Locutus, had a serious look on his face when he added, &#8220;This is an assignment I requested and don&#8217;t won&#8217;t to, no, Can&#8217;t fail at, no matter what&#8221; He paused, &#8220;This has to end here, somewhere I know and can prepare for, now do you understand?&#8221; he looked at all the men present, all nodded. All now had a clearer understanding of what was up and what was expected of them. A serious matter indeed. One had will be harder to deal with than the outlaw bunch. 
<br />
<br />Morning came quickly. New riders had arrived right before dawn and were over at the livery stable. Thirty in all, guns and badges all. Locutus looked out from his room at the hotel. He was ready for this part. He had received the telegram of their arrival two hours ago, from Washington. 
<br />
<br />Sw was ready to go when Wolfy pulled up in his buggy. He hopped out and went around to help her in. After she was seated, he put her case in the back and they were off for the school house. &#8220;I appreciate you help, both today and for taking me back and forth, Wolfy&#8221; She said, flashing a smile and blushing a bit too. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Your more than welcome Ma...sw&#8221; Wolfy replied, catching himself. 
<br />
