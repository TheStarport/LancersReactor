			<div class="content">&quot;NukeIt to Black Gold...I can't make it to you. There are too many patrols out here, and I don't want this to escalate any further. Leave the system under cloak and I will contact you when it is safe to do so. Out.&quot;
<br />
<br />Not waiting for a reply, NukeIt switched off his transciever and stared out the canopy as if it was empty space. This was not going at all according to plan- from the moment he had set foot on Freeport 10, the situation had clearly deteriorated beyond his ability to repair. He had detected trace amounts of that vile substance when he was on board, and now it was confirmed- Cardamine. Concealed by the freighter's empty aft holding clamps, NukeIt had been given ample time to thoroughly analyze its sole container, and it turned out to be full of the stuff. Freeport 10 was now a distribution hub for the stuff, and it was leaving in shipments of unprecedented bulk. Shipments large enough to supply battle fleets for weeks at a time. This could mean only one thing: the Outcasts, with the four houses weakened by war, were making their move against the Sirius sector. 
<br />
<br /><i>Well, </i> he thought with a grim satisfaction, <i>this'll be one less shipment that reaches the front lines. </i> He squeezed all four firing triggers simultaneously, slicing cleanly through the spine of the transport with high-powered lasers and starting a chain reaction within its fuel cells. He jetted away moments before the vessel blossomed into a fireball, quickly vanishing to leave nothing but a few scraps of metal...
<br />
<br />The next move was clear. Activate all operatives in all four houses. A handful of battleships and cruisers were crewed by operatives in Liberty and Kusari...but lacking a direct means of communicating with the Osiris and Orillion, NukeIt was left with no choice but to try and contact each of them individually...</div>

			<div class="content">The door of Griffon's cell slid open. &quot;Ok, time to get out.&quot; Griffon recognised the voice immediately. &quot;Took your time&quot; he said, as the two men paced down the corridor. &quot;I had enough trouble getting past security as it is. They fixed it up alright, but if a higher ranking officer finds out we'll be blown.&quot; Griffon knew that by &quot;They&quot; the man was referring to the people they worked for.
<br />
<br />They reached the docking bays, and stopped at Griffon's ship. &quot;New orders&quot; rasped the man. &quot;You're to head to freeport 10, we've had word that something is going on down there. On arrival you're to inspect the company's interests and if necessary use force to protect them.&quot;
<br />The orders were vague at best but Griffon knew better than to question them.
<br />&quot;Stay very close to my ship. Their sensors wont pick you up till you're far away enough to make the jump. I'll deal with any followers.&quot;
<br />
<br />Griffon felt good to be back in his ship. It was his element. He gazed out through to cockpit to the stars beyond, then turning towards the ship of his nameless friend, exchanged a quick salute, and set his drives for Freeport 10.</div>

<br />
<br />&quot;Barz&#251;l!&quot; he cursed as he started a stream of curses that would terrify even the hardiest of the corsairs. Storming to the deck computer he roughly shoved the el-tee maning the station out of his char and checked all of the military reports.
<br />
<br />&quot;patrol gamma to pitsburgh
<br />alpha squadron to texas
<br />Rouge to !SYSTEM UNKNOWN!
<br />beta 6 to magellan&quot; &quot;thats it!&quot; he said and ordered his shroud preped for combat.
<br />
<br />upon entering the cokpit he launched and immediatly activated his warp drive to the magellan system.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT. The warp and jump drives on my shroud are far more powerful than the alliance ones. this is because they are enhanced with sirius's tech. never attempt to out run me in this ship, it is impossible,</div>

			<div class="content"><i>Meanwhile, somewhere in the Magellan system... </i>
<br />
<br />A flight of four Anubis-class fighters brushed lightly by NukeIt's black Patriot. Their drive flares momentarily illuminated a pair of Liberty cruisers before receding into the  denser bands of the particle cloud. NukeIt saluted the pilots, although they could neither see nor hear him- they were the first to respond to the call to arms. It had taken some extremely careful maneuvering, but he had caught up with the cruisers Savannah and Albany just inside the Liberty border. 
<br />
<br /><i>Not much yet, </i> he thought, <i>but enough to play hell with the enemy's supply lines until we can call out some heavy re-enforcements. </i>
<br />
<br />*Gravitic anomaly detected. Possible jump-hole formation. Recommend evasive action.*
<br />
<br /><i>The hell? That ought to be impossible...this area's too stable for... </i>
<br />
<br />NukeIt's train of thought was abruptly interrupted by the sudden appearence of Shroud's Shroud right outside his cockpit canopy. Not willing to take any chances, he kicked over full power to weapons and shields, foot hovering over the thruster control and a steady hand above the mine release. At this range, he knew, a Ripper detonation would likely cripple both ships, but he would not hesitate to unleash his tiny ship's full fury if this newcomer should prove hostile.</div>

			<div class="content">Detecting an energy spike he decided it would be best to play it on the safe side so Shroud diverted energy to shields. Hailing the patriot he broad casted: &quot;This is Lieutenant Colonel Shroud to unidentified craft cut you engines and send ID immediately. Several seconds passed before the patriot did something. Shroud detected a subspace broadcast from the patriot aimed right at the lane hacker base. Immediately engaging engines he called for back up, then engaged his cloak in the hopes that he could trail this ship until the rest of his squadron could get out here.
<br />
<br />Squadron rules and regulations!
<br />
<br />Each player is allowed a squadron of fighters that s\he commands. This squadron must use similar ships as you, so no patriots flying in a bunch of sabers. Their armaments can vary so you could have say 2 heavy defenders In case of a capital ship fight with the rest being patriots holding cruise disruptors.
<br />
<br />If it ever existed in the lancer series i'll allow it.
<br />
<br />Squadron Data: you should have a list of: Call signs, Ship Type, Equipment, etc.
<br />
<br />Squadron Power: Same thing happens for PvP as for your squadron combat. just instead of losing a limb you lose a ally.
<br />
<br />My squadron:
<br />
<br />1. Call sign: Copperhead, Ship: Alliance Patriot, 2 screamer pods and the rest are Vagabonds
<br />2: Call sign: Wolf, Ship: Reaper, 3 jackhammers with the rest being Hawks
<br />3: Call sign: Demon, Ship: Wolverine, Solomons
<br />4. Call sign: Desert Fox, Ship: Mirage IV, 2 Havok, 2 Imp
<br />5. Call sign: Gamma 1: Ship: Hades, 4 Nuclear tipped Torpedoes
<br />6. Call sign: Gamma 2: Ship: Hades, 4 Nuclear tipped Torpedoes
<br />
<br />Note how all of my wingmen fly ships from the same faction, with matching equipment. i have 2 men in there that take down capital ships, while the rest are dog fighters.</div>

<br />Shroud, I don't know if you got my email, because I didn't get a reply (could possibly be a bug on my end)
<br />
<br />Be advised I may make EVE references rather than Lancer references.  If you spot one, give me a shout <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />Finally, Mr. DM, please give me something to do.  If you don't I'll just end up creating really contrived encounters in a belated attempt to get Langford off this backwater planet. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> </i>

<br />Langford was one of those people who did not find it funny when Command failed to specify that his transport was leaving half an hour early to 'make up for lost time'.  He was now stuck on this scrapheap until he could find someone willing to lift him off.  What fun.

			<div class="content"><i>Seeing as how there are already a pair of Order-controlled Liberty Cruisers and a quartet of Anubis fighters sitting pretty not 100 meters away from this little standoff... </i>
<br />
<br />NukeIt, noting a trace of antagonism in Shroud's voice, took the precaution of sending an alert notice to the cruisers Savannah and Albany- which, as it just so happens, sit directly between NukeIt's fighter and the Lane Hacker base Mactan. Seconds later, Shroud's fighter vanishes. Gritting his teeth, NukeIt fired up his engines and made tracks for the cruisers. Sensing that this could get hairy, a transfer of command seemed appropriate.
<br />
<br />&quot;Savannah, NukeIt. I am assuming command of your vessel. Prepare your shuttlebay.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>Since these ships were already in existence at the time Shroud dropped the latest little regulations, I figured it would be better to switch ships and command a pair of cruisers and their escort, rather than a Patriot dragging along a pair of heavily armed cruisers. The Patriot will get remanded to personal transportation for those *ahem* places where one just can't take a cruiser. The crusiers are bog standard Liberty fare; we all know what they can and can't do (swarms of fighters being one of their &quot;can't dos&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. Their escort consists of four Anubis fighters loaded for escort duty- Cruise disrupters, Death's Hand turret, Death's Hand II's on all other mounts. All other gear is Order standard issue. </i>
<br />
<br /><i>About five minutes later, on the Savannah's bridge... </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain, lay in a course for the Leeds jump hole. All ships to defensive formation...no surprises. Waste anything that even looks like it's preparing to fire a weapon...got me?&quot;
<br />
<br />The Savannah, now under the command of a certain Order special-operations branch Operative (read that: assassin), followed by the Albany and a flight of four Anubis fighters, lights off its sublight drives and pivots on its axis, burning hard for the jump hole. In the moments before the cruiser plummeted into the gulf between systems, NukeIt keyed the comms system and sent a broadwave out to Shroud- wherever, that is, he was hiding under his cloak.
<br />
<br />&quot;Unidentified vessel, make no attempt to pursue or engage. We are not here for a fight, but will not hesitate to defend ourselves if attacked. The security of the colonies depends on the successful completion of our mission...Savannah out.&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />IC: Upon reciving the tranmission shroud called off the alert. That sounded suspiciously like the order, and given there spy networks capabilites they might be able to help him find out what was going on. he deleted all info about the fighter from the liberty archives and engaged warp back to the missouri. Still the order was difficult to contact and he was currently piloting the only ship capable of finding them alone. Tracing the data from the broad cast back to a liberty crusier he locked on to the signal. he wouldn't follow them, but he would keep an eye on them.
<br />
<br />Upon docking he found multiple guards waiting for him. When questioned they said nothing other then having orders. Shroud made a break for the bay when he saw weapons fire shoot over his head. time for his ace in the hole. shooting the bay doors control he blew everone in the bay into space. That meant that he was also the only one safe. he remote tractored himself into his shroud and warped to britonia with the rest of his squadron. Maybe now he could find out what was going on without protocols getting in the way.
<br />
<br />OOC: TET this is what you need to do. put yourself in positions that endanger yourself and others, then react to the situation

			<div class="content">Meanwhile, Griffon was sitting in his ship, surveying Freeport 10 dispassionately. The ship was in a de-activated state, all engines and avionic equiptment had been disabled. He would not have looked like anything more than an asteroid to any long distance scanner.
<br />
<br />Something wasn't right, but he couldn't quite pick it. He decided to turn externally for support. He activated the communication system and broadcast an encrypted message over a pre-set frequency. &quot;Griffon two six reporting. The area is a mess. No civilian traffic in area, evidence of a battle of some sort visible. By all appearence Freeport 10 is in lock-down state. I have a bad feeling, request permission to exit sector.&quot;
<br />The message may have been picked up by any listeners, and could, with enough time, be decoded, but Griffon was aware that whatever was going to happen would happen before it could be, and by that time it wouldn't matter anyway. Within a few minutes a reply came.
<br />&quot;Permission denied. You are to land at Freeport 10 and assess the situation. We have knowledge of what has occured, this time do not hesitate to use force if necessary.&quot;
<br />Griffon grit his teeth, and replied:
<br />&quot;Concentration of heavy ships, possibly cruisers, picked up by scanners upon jumping into sector. again, request permission to exit sector.&quot;
<br />The answer came in scarcely a minute:
<br />&quot;Permission denied. Cruisers will be delt with if needs be. Proceed to Freeport 10.&quot;
<br />
<br />Griffon sighed and sprung into action, re-activating his ship and setting it on an intercept course for the Freeport, his mind racing. Something big was going down, and he could guess what.

			<div class="content"><i>A small aside: Liberty Cruisers are not small. While not the largest of capital ships, they lug around enough firepower to take on a battleship, assuming they are pointed in the proper direction. That's not even mentioning the payload of heavy-duty gravitic mines or any of the secondary armaments. Without a cloaking device, it is really very difficult to keep one's presence a secret when flying around in one. When you're flying around with two, you might as well just cover them all in radioactive flourescent yellow paint for all the good silent running is going to do you. Of course, this problem is only compounded by bursting into the territory of a major house system unannounced whilst flying around in another house's premier heavy attack vessel. The local law enforcement tends to not appreciate that much. This would be the problem currently facing a certain Order assassin and his newly formed battlegroup. </i>
<br />
<br />A pair of Liberty cruisers and their escort sat surrounded by Bretonia Gunboats and Crusaders in high orbit around Leeds- facing them was a fully armed, fully alert, fully staffed, and <i>very </i> irate battleship that had only just asked to see some credentials.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir...are you sure we couldn't take them?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain, just because we <i>can </i> take out a battleship doesn't mean we ought to. We have a few men in the Indomitable's senior officer corps... we'll just have to count on them to get this mess sorted out.&quot;</div>

Unable to move much on land and unable to speak in the human tongue, he's mostly known for amusing his fellow shipmates. How he reached the rank of commodore no-one is sure, but it's said it had something to do with a drunken bet. When asked, Recusant had only this to say:

			<div class="content"><b>Langford  </b>
<br />
<br />Walking along a darkened street, Langford thought he heard sounds of a commotion up ahead, round a corner.  He strained his ears to listen to what was going on, above the constant roar of spaceship engines.
<br />
<br /><i>OOC: Listen Check: 1d20 + 1 (skill modifier)  - 2 (circumstance penalty) = 17 + 1 - 2 = 16
<br />
<br />At this point, DM, you'll need to decide then tell me what he can hear, whether it be nothing at all (i.e, he can hear that nothing is happening) or if someone is being attacked.  Or, if he fails the listen check and can't hear anything, or partly fails and mishears.  You get the idea. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />You're going to be doing this an awful lot, I'm afraid <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> </i>
<br />
<br />EDIT: Switching out bold font, it is very distracting.

			<div class="content">Bored stiff, Nikoli stalked out of the bar, headed for the space dock.
<br />
<br />&quot;I've got to get a ship&quot; he thought.
<br />
<br />As if in answer to his thoughts the most beautful ship he had ever seen cruised over the city and came to stop on a landing pad a few blocks away.  It was love at first sight.  A deep crimson Benz/Fujiyama Civilian Runabout.  Larger than a fighter, slightly more manuverable, and armed as heavily as a gunboat.  The Runabout cost more credits than is even possible for a runaway to imagine.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, it looks like something here is going to come under new ownership.&quot; Nikoli thought, as he made his way through the crowded city street. 
<br />
<br />He snatched a bucket and a rag from a window cleaner as he walked by, and made his way to the landing pad.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Mister, Wash your ship?&quot;  He asked in his most inocent voice.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sure, whatever.&quot; muttered the multi-milionare.  &quot;Just don't scratch the paint.&quot;
<br />
<br />As the man walked off, Nikoli slipped into the cockpit.  &quot;Moron&quot; he thought. &quot;He even left the keys.&quot;   With the push of a few buttons he was off, flying over the city faster than he thought possible.  
<br />
<br />Then suddenly, a patrol of several LPI ships were on his tail.  With a stomp of his foot, Nikoli activated the ships thrusters, and was off. He only hoped he could outrun the cops behind him.</div>
