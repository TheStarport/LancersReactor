			<div class="content">Quick set of ground rules:
<br />
<br />Assistant GM will be chosen after I see everyone rp for a time.
<br />Registration is still open.
<br />No force hitting or god modding.
<br />
<br />Storyline is set several decades after the NOMAD conflict
<br />
<br />Lets begin:
<br />
<br />The azure clouds of the Magellan System shown into the porthole windows of the Jackal's main base.  Triyun Kun inhaled the bland reprocessed air of the base.  Triyun thought to himself, the Siruis Sector was amazing.  These large beautiful nebule could be seen with the naked eye, to get such images from Earth took the creation of the Hubble Space Telescope, the greatest invention astronomically of its time. An aide came up to the sharply dressed commander, &#8220;sir, our observers at the Freeport have observed a Liberty Naval Squadron passing through the sector several times, they have managed to venture much closer to our base than we would prefer.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Kun sighed, &#8220;Are they a threat?&#8221;  &#8220;Its the opinion of centcomm at Crete they are.&#8221; the aide responded.  
<br />
<br />&#8220;I suppose no reinforcements will be sent, we'll have to pull our weight with a dozen craft.&#8221;Kun said angrily
<br />
<br />&#8220;Correct.&#8221; the aide said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very well, deploy Rodriguez and Ferdinand on recon.&#8221; Kun replied.
<br />
<br />The aide nodded.  Kun stared out the window of his office continuously thinking, thinking of his next raid.  He was a much more aggressive commander than the Elder at Crete.  He preferred to establish a major military presence in Liberty.  The Corsair command feared them.  He sighed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Jackal 2 here, Jackal 6 form up on my left wing.&#8221; said Rodriguez. &#8220;6 copies 2.&#8221; Ferdinand responded.  The two titans went sensor passive outside the trade lanes putting the systems central star behind them blinding anyone from seeing them.  They waited watching the trade lanes, the lane hackers would undoubtadly disrupt the trade lane.  It was their best bet to draw out cruisers.</div>

<br />
<br />Equipment for Demon Fires: Sunslayer torpedo launchers (they're only sold at Bruschal), Lancer Missiles, Advanced Countermeasure Flares, FireKiss MK I plasma guns (650 Hull damage, 325 Shield damage. Slow refire rate.), ripper mines, advanced thrusters, and Rhineland Deathkiss (or whatever they're called) laser guns (100 Hull damage, 50 Shield damage. Fast refire rate)
<br />
<br />_________________________
<br />Berne, New Berlin
<br />
<br />Erich Stalner breathed in deeply as he walked through the shadowy corridors of rock that make up Berne. Torches line the walls, burning. Just as the Demon Fires would burn away the corruption wracking Rhineland.
<br />
<br />&lt;HERR STALNER, please report to landing pad 5 for liftoff&gt; creaked the intercom.
<br />
<br />Stalner sighed, tying back his long raggedy hair. A small burst of excitement exploded in his chest as he and the other members of the Fires entered the docking bays.
<br />
<br />Stalner walked over to the newest member of his guerrilla fighters, the young Maria Aarden. &quot;Hail, Comrade.&quot; Maria smiled weakly. &quot;Ready for your first mission with the Fires?&quot;
<br />
<br />She nodded and headed off to her Sabre.
<br />
<br />&lt;Bundschuh Squadron Theta 3-1, you are cleared for liftoff&gt;  the control tower declared. Stalner watched as Victor, a hardened geurilla rebel who had been flying with him for over five years, launched his Sabre into the asteroid field beyond Berne.
<br />
<br />&lt;Bundschuh Squadron Theta 3-2, you're free to go&gt; 
<br />
<br />&lt;Bundschuh Squadron Theta 3-3, you're cleared for launch&gt; 
<br />
<br />Stalner watched Maria, number 3-4, ready herself at her controls, now cool, controlled, and in power over herself and her ship.
<br />
<br />As she cleared her landing pad, Erich heard the control tower sound again: &lt;Bundschuh Squadron Theta Leader, you're ready to go. Good luck out there&gt;   He nodded and soared outside of the station with the rest of his fighters.
<br />
<br />&lt;Hans, brief us on the mission&gt; he announced into his intercom
<br />
<br />&lt;An executive of the Reichstag, Johann Flescher, is gonna be passing through the tradelane at Essen to get to New Berlin. The one responsible for that paycut Daumann workers got a month ago. We've got to take this guy out.&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Difficulty?&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;He's got help. Two, three wings of Valkyries escorting him. Maybe four if we're unlucky.&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Shouldn't be too hard. Theta 2, go 1K under the trade ring. Theta 1, lead the assault. We'll hang behind and pick him off.&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Theta 1 leader, heard and understood&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Theta 2 leader, same here.&gt;
<br />
<br />The Demon fires split apart, preparing for the assault as Essen station neared in sight. Drawing closer, Theta 2 split off and started heading downwards, out of range of any radar signals. Stalner gave the order, and all ships powered down engines and waited.
<br />
<br />Then they saw. Ships hurtling along in the normal golden blur of lane travel. Still 100 K away from Essen.
<br />
<br />2 wings of Banshees passed through the trade lane from the other side, clearly waiting to dock with the station.
<br />
<br />&lt;Theta 2, change of plans. We can't afford to engage those Banshees. Take down the trade lane shields!&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;Heard and Understood. All ships fire at will.&gt;
<br />
<br />Within seconds the trade lane rings were down and offline, a good 30 K away from the station. Stalner heard over the intercom &lt;Theta 2 wing, engaging enemy forces&gt;
<br />
<br />Stalner's wing and Theta 1 activated their cruise engines and soared towards the ensuing battle scene. 2 wings of Valkyries and a transport carrying Flescher. Not a problem in the least. &lt;Affirmative Theta 2. Engage the Valkyries. Theta 1, engage enemy forces. Theta 3 go for the transport!&gt; The Sabres responded like wildfire to his commands, launching missile after missile into the transport while the green flame of the pirated Rhineland plasma and laser guns the Fires had stocked up hit the fighters with dead, cold accuracy. An easy death.
<br />
<br />(battle strategies: Launch missiles and torpedoes into the transport while gunning it down. As soon as its destroyed, hightail it out of there. Two ships remain at the back launching hordes of Countermeasures against any launched cruise disruptors.)

<br />
<br />IC:
<br /> Commodore Stevenson looked out of the front view ports with awe; no matter how many times he saw it the nebula clouds in Tau 37 took his breath away. He glanced up at the large computer screen suspended above the view ports. This screen could be used to display any image and was used during battle to see the enemy more clearly. Right now, however, it showed a wire frame schematic of the ship.
<br />
<br />Around the sides of the bridge various officers went about there duties mostly paying no attention to the Commodore who was tapping the arm mounted computer screen on his chair. Jonathan was replaying there voyage through the asteroids just checking to make sure they had not been followed.
<br />
<br />A young Flight lieutenant approached the chair
<br />&quot;Excuse me sir&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes, lieutenant?&quot; replied the commodore
<br />&quot;Something strange is going on we lost contact with fleet command&quot; the junior officer said shakily
<br />&quot;Ok mate calm, down probably just a comm failure, we must of scraped it on a roid on the way in. These new capital shields aren&#8217;t all they said they would be eh?&quot; Jonathan said jokingly
<br />&quot;We checked that already, the failure must be at fleet command&quot;
<br />&quot;Well till we get new orders put the ship on alert, power the shields and put delta wing on standby
<br />&quot;Aye sir!&quot; and with a salute the junior officers went to his console
<br />
<br />Jonathan though to himself
<br />&quot;This is strange, well nothing much we can do may as well relax&quot;
<br />And with that put on some ancient music and reclined in his chair

<br />Wilde I think you will find this style of RPG a very refreshing style of play, CYOF is great, but this allows for a lot more creativity.
<br />
<br />Oh btw this goes for everyone, you can all occasionally use sunslayers, and they will only be slightly more powerful than other vessels, but Bundusch is the only ones who have steady supply of them.</div>

			<div class="content">OOC: I think Omega hasn't look my description very well. EVERYTIME something wasn't right (I asked the admin and such), I removed it from the list. I beleive by now the battleship is perfectly normal. That, and I don't plan much on PvP. So I dunno what you guys are crying for. Moving on.
<br />
<br />IC :
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Battleship Canada, Authorization Alpha Tree Gamma Fower Fife Yankee Niner. Requesting to dock to resupply with Oxygen, Water and Food. Please respond.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;*Robot Voice* This is Ames Research Station. Please standby, as we accomodate the docking stations for a cargo transfert unit.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;*RB* Battleship Canada, we have 3 ennemy contacts at 330&#176; North. Sending light fighter wings to protect you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Affirmative. Power up weapons!&quot;
<br />
<br />The ship made an instant slow move into a side position, powering up and aiming all guns at the incoming ships. All warnings lights in the ship were lite, and everyone was asked to stay at its battlestation. This is how each battle was handled in Battleship Canada. 
<br />
<br />The Commander always said &quot;What's the point of using the right amount of men for a battle ? If everyone trains once in a while to our battle tactics, won't they become better ? Heck, the ennemies could send information about the ship in that 1/16 of a second we didn't hit him with a flak energy ball.&quot;
<br />
<br />Since then, everyone was always waiting for a battle, and ready for it. It has changed the ship much, but it was better that way.
<br />
<br />Weapons powered, the ship send its first volley of shooting, missiles and flaks, by their respective turrets.
<br />
<br />*Waits for a GM to answer*</div>

			<div class="content">It has potential, no doubt about that. As long as the players keep it within the bounds of FL canon it should remain a source of enjoyment for a long time.
<br />
<br />Now, on to my post...
<br />
<br />Randy Sega sat in the Trenton Outpost bar, waiting for his next assignment. He and his Merry Men had recently returned from Rheinland space after delivering a valuable cargo of Mining Machinery to Leipzig Station in Dresden. The Red Hessians had recently become much more militaristic and there was a lot of money to be made running the new gauntlet to the Daumann base. As usual, the mission went off without a hitch, most of the pirates realizing they were outmatched. There was a bit of excitement on the way home though. A Corsair raiding party had decided to knock out the tradelane from Hamburg to the Bering jumpgate just when the Merry Men were travelling through it. They didn't live long enough to regret it. Otherwise the trip was without incident and the Merry Men were now enjoying some well-deserved downtime.
<br />
<br />Downtime that was soon to end.
<br />
<br />Randy noticed a well-dressed man approaching his table. He leaned back in his seat and stretched his arms behind his head.
<br />
<br />&quot;You the guy they call 'Reliable' Randy?&quot; The suit asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm Randy, who want's to know?&quot; Randy replied.
<br />
<br />&quot;My employer's name is unimportant. All you need to know is that there is a job for you. A very well-paying job.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Really?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. The reward is in excess of 10,000,000 credits...&quot;
<br />
<br />Randy whistled. That was a lot of money.
<br />
<br />&quot;...per pilot.&quot; The strange man finished.
<br />
<br />&quot;Over 10 million credits? Per pilot?&quot; Randy could hardly believe his ears. <i>Who the hell has access to those sorts of funds? </i> He wondered. &quot;So, what's the job? And why not just do this through the standard channels? Universal would just assign us to a job like this anyway.&quot; He asked, trying to remain casual and compsed.
<br />
<br />&quot;My employer wishes to keep the arrangement outside of official channels. You are but one of the choices available to us; should you decline we will look elsewhere for a courier.&quot; The suit said. &quot;And we must discuss the particulars elsewhere. If you are interested, meet me in Sector 4 of the Beta Biodome on Freeport 2 in two days time. Bring the Merry Men.&quot; And, with that, the strange man turned and walked away.
<br />
<br />Randy knew the deal was too good to be true but the lure of 10 million credits was hard to resist. He summoned his squad to the bar and told them what had happened. Before long the 21 men and women agreed to at least follow up on the offer and see exactly what the big deal was.
<br />
<br />&quot;Reliable&quot; Randy and his Merry Men prepped their ships for launch. They still had a few days of official vacation time and decided to make the most of it.</div>

			<div class="content">&#8220;Must your accommodations be so inhospitable, Damien?&#8221; sighed a short man, dressed in the clothes that only nobility are able to afford, &#8220;It is most unpleasant trying to relax in such a cramped space!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Another man sitting near-by let off a slight grin, laughing quietly to himself as he responded to the question, &#8220;Forgive me, my good sir. I would love to install cushioned seats, several bars, and perhaps even a sleeping area appropriate for a man of your stature&#8230; yet the last time I tried such things, I discovered that my ship became much more prone to exploding in a most &#8216;unpleasant&#8217; manner&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh&#8230; well, perhaps I will be able to live with these conditions&#8230; tell me, do you have any refreshments in here? Ahh, what I wouldn&#8217;t give for a nice glass of water&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Damien shook his head in disgust, wondering why he had ever agreed to allow a spoiled Liberty brat into his Geschwin&#8230;
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />&#8216;Oh, you there! Yes, you at the bar! Damien, is it? Yes, I&#8217;ve heard of you!&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Hmm? What do yo-&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Hello, hello! I am Robert Drishle, surely you&#8217;ve heard of me?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Actua-&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Excellent! Now that we are acquainted, perhaps you could assist me with a small problem of mine?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Oh, what typ-&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Perfect! Now, all I will need is for you to escort me and my lovely diamonds&#8230; my, they are lovely, aren&#8217;t they! Just look out how they sparkle&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Excuse m-&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Very good! We shall leave immediately! Oh, and, I have but one more request of you!&#8221;
<br />&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Would you mind if I stayed with you, in your ship, while we travel over to the New York system? You see, my last escort suddenly disappeared some time after we left Bautzen&#8230; a shame, really, I was just in the middle of telling him about my most recent trip on an Orbital Spa luxury liner! Oh, now that I think of it, I still have some time before the diamonds are completely loaded into my vessels, let me tell you that very story while we wait!&#8221;
<br />
<br />---
<br />
<br />Damien quickly shook the thought out of his head, and stared at the Geschwin&#8217;s command console, hoping for anyone to appear on the screen so that he might be authorized for launch.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Then, when I had finished using the Spa on Level Three, I proceeded back up to the Ballroom on Level One. You won&#8217;t believe who I met there, none other than&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Damien sighed, knowing that he was in store for an extremely long day&#8230;</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;'The Merry Men', eh?&quot; Erich relaxed on the carpeted benches in Berne's bar. &quot;I wonder how Robin Hood got all the way into Dresden.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yah, that's not even the best part. They ship anythin' through the Omegas--Gold, Diamonds, hell you name it! Open to most clients I assume too. Profit-oriented, protecting goods from pirates and rabble and the like.&quot;
<br />
<br />Erich frowned. &quot;They'd transport the documents, then? Or don't they associate with people like us--the rebels.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, there's only one way to find out.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hell, I'm no diplomat, Hans. I'm a fighter.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We'll send Maria then. She'll get them to agree to ship it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If we can get her to agree to it...she's a strong-headed woman, no doubt about that. Not bad looking either.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, I didn't know you were that way inclined, Erich. Your experiences with the boys back at Bruschal...what would Karl say?&quot; Hans smiled in his normal diabolical fashion.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh very funny. The thing with Karl...happened 5 years ago. We're just friends now. Ach, I'll consider asking her. I don't think she'll go, tho.&quot;

			<div class="content">OOC: Force hits means the rper calls damage on the other.  A minor NPC, meaning one I am not controlling can have hits called on it within reason.  If its a member of someone elses squadron its considered a PC and thus no hits are allowed.
<br />
<br />PC stands for Playable Character all units you guys control in your unit is considered PC
<br />NPC stands for Non-Playable Character which the GM will introduce and use
<br />Minor NPC is a non-playable character which is controlled by the player typically as an enemy, the player who introduces minor npcs can control their fate.</div>

<br />IC : 
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, The weapons have fired.&quot;
<br />
<br />-Damage report ?
<br />
<br />-All their shields are down. Another voley and it's nearly done.
<br />
<br />The Commander Noded, as he looked briefly at the window, clearly seeing everything of the battle. He saw a glimpse of energy travel at all speed toward the ship, and three distinct explosions.
<br />
<br />&quot;Tactor in the loot, put the escape pods in our jail. Battlestations, return to normal duty. COmmander out&quot;, said the Commander in his microphone.
<br />
<br />&quot;* Robot Voice * This is Ames Research Station, docking bay six ready to accomodate battleship's cargo hold entrance. Your cargo is ready sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />The Commander went down the decks, and entered docking bay 6. The station was fairly old, but the technology was there, and he easily find a good spot to sit in the bar. But one man had to be there and disturb him.
<br />
<br />-Sir, are you the Commander of Battleship Canada ?
<br />-Yes. What's the matter ?
<br />-Direct Order from the Liberty Navy. The scientific team will need to investigate about strange jumphole readings in Tau-37. We expect you to report in 5 days at most.
<br />-What's wrong with those readings ?
<br />-Well, we can't ID them. We'd need samples and data. Only battleship scanners are able to give that much information.
<br />-Alright...
<br />
<br />Robertson wasn't happy, but he cannot just refuse... He'd loose his job.
<br />
<br />He sighed, and went toward his battleship's bridge.</div>

			<div class="content">&#8220;&#8230;and we all know what happens when you run into her! That&#8217;s right, bankruptcy! However, I wouldn&#8217;t let her persuade me into buying anything that easily! I spent a whole five minutes talking with her about th&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Damien suddenly sprang out of his slumped position and jumped upright in front of his chair, &#8220;Mr. Drishle! I just remembered that I have a whole storage area of the purest water Rheinland has to offer in the cargo bay! You simply must head back there to sample it!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Rheinland water, you say? Well, I am no large fan of Rheinland water, perhaps one of the foulest drinks ever created in all of Sirius&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Rolling his eyes, Damien began telling grand stories of how he happened upon that water. He described in great length and detail of how he traveled to the farther sectors of space, fighting off some of the worst villains to ever live, all the while defending a trade convoy carrying precious metals. Not one ship was lost during that mission and no villain survived the wrath of the Geschwin, and after weeks upon weeks of endless adventure, the precious metals arrived safely at their final destination. The water had been a reward for this great adventure, or at least Damien claimed as much.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am simply astounded by how much a single man can talk! Damien, cease your speaking, your story has bored me enough already! Now, if for no reason other than to close that mouth of yours, where is this Rheinland &#8216;water&#8217;?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Soon enough the little man was hurrying into the back rooms, continuing his tail on the splendor that is Orbital Spa and Cruise luxury liners. Damien slowly sat back down upon his chair, and began grinning as widely as he could. He extended his hand over the command console, still lacking the picture of any port authority, and turned several switches into the &#8216;on&#8217; position. Almost immediately the clanking of metal slamming down upon metal was heard, and Damien spun completely around in his chair, facing the now-sealed cargo bay door.
<br />
<br />A muffled voice came from behind the solid six-foot steel, &#8220;Damien, you simply must repair this ship of yours, there seems to be some sort of mechanical error with this ancient door!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Forgive me, my good sir, the Geschwin has not been to the shop for quite a length of time! I shall try my best to fix the situation on this side! Until then, I suggest you make yourself as comfortable as you are able!&#8221; replied Damien, with his grin turning into a silent laugh.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Golden Striker &#8216;Geschwin&#8217;,&#8221; boomed a new voice over the sound of static, &#8220;this is Bautzen Port Authority, you have been cleared for launch.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Damien spun his chair back around so he could once more see the command console. He then took a small, handheld device from under the console, and hit a button on the device&#8217;s side before speaking loudly into it.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bautzen Port Authority, this is the Golden Striker Geschwin, proceeding to launch.&#8221;
<br />
<br />With his free hand, Damien turned a dial several degrees, and once more he spoke loudly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Universal Shipping &#8216;Drishle&#8217;, we are cleared for launch. Let&#8217;s get this mission over with before your captain finds the button that opens a certain cargo bay door.&#8221;
<br />
<br />After several moments of cheering on the other side of the radio, the Geschwin activated its maneuvering engines, and slowly drifted out of the docking bay. Behind it followed two Universal trains, both packed fully with diamonds&#8230;</div>
