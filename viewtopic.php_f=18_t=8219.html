			<div class="content">Freelancer is a spectactular single-player game, and the multiplayer experience is outstanding... for a while. The shortcomings of the game are well documented, and rather than add another &quot;freelancer MP sucks I have a titan in 3 hours&quot; thread, I thought I would add a post here, to hopefully give some of you modders some ideas. Who knows, I may even get involved.
<br />
<br />Just to rehash the basic flaws with the multiplayer component, here is a list of problems I've found with the game. I'm sure they've been all dscussed in other threads, in other forums... but they bear repeating in a context of &quot;let's fix this&quot; rather than &quot;this game sux dood&quot;.
<br />
<br />1) Making money is too easy. 
<br />
<br />Unless you enjoy missions... hauling cargo is clearly a superior way to make money. Simply hauling Luxury Trade Goods from Manhattan to London and bringing Luxury Food back will make you upwards of 500k an hour. Combined with faction tricks, this makes for quick and dirty money making. Clearly some of the more profitable and less-dangerous routes need removing. Ajusting the faction system will solve many of the problems, and making death more costly would help as well... but the balance between mission jobs and cargo jobs needs to be adressed. Long routes through dangerous territory are not rewarded well enough, relatively speaking. Going from Omnicron Beta to Cambridge with a bay full of alien organisms should be more profitable than simply going from Manhattan to London... but it's simply not the case. Those supertransports bring lots of goods around the tradelanes. Make the traders go off the beaten paths to make their big bucks.
<br />
<br />2) Class 10 ships overpower anything. It's not uncommon for a good player to take on 8-10 Ace Corsair Titans solo.
<br />
<br />Part of the problem with MP is the fact that once you have your Titan or whatever... you can go anywhere and kill anything. These ships need a serious nerf. It should be an option to use a light figther. You should have a reason to bring a friend along for a big fight. Class 10 guns dropping off shipwrecks? Please. The &quot;best&quot; equipment needs to be harder to get. Nomad guns or whatever you decide should be the elite weapons need to be rare, and hard to get... and easy to loee. Flying solo and coming back with 4 nomad guns in 20 minutes cheapens the game. I would eliminate class 9 and 10 guns altogether. Eliminate the Xhvy fighter class, and use the models to build different heavy fighters. A class 8 heavy fighter vs a classs 7 Banshee is a good match. A banshee vs a Titan is a joke. 
<br />
<br />3) Little variation at the top of the ladder. Everyone has the same guns and one of three ships. Missiles optional.
<br />
<br />Similar to the above, we need choices. the top fighters shouldn't simply obliterate freighters. Two Humpbacks should have a chance of driving off a PKiller... if they stick together. We should see the best players flying a variety of ships... not just three. Top-end freighters should have the same armor, shielding, and more guns. They are larger, and have more hardpoints. The maneuverability advantage of the fighter is supreme anyway. Even if freighters had class 10 guns they wouldn't stand a chance as an agressor... they have no cruise disruptors. If someone wants to fly a tank, let them. If they want a quick, nimble fighter... so be it. 90% of the ship models are never used, because nobody wants a light figther or a freighter with less than 250 cargo. New ships should fill holes in the high end, and hopefully give more choice to players. How about small, quick ship with some decent cargo space?  Where's my hybrid fighter? I want a 100-cargo class 8 ship to do long runs into hostile zones. Take a few guns off and add some cargo space. Maybe I want a light fighter that goes 400 on cruise. How about a 150-cargo class 8 freighter? How about a fighter without countermeasures... but a little more room in the hold? I hate my Sabre. Take it away and give me choices please.
<br />
<br />4) The faction system is broken. Currently, shooting three storage depots at Manhattan and buying Zoners faction at freeport 4 makes you non-KOS to all but Corsairs.
<br />
<br />Clearly this is most in need of an overhaul. Not only is it simple to get on the good side of everyone in the known universe, but it's counterproductive to work for anyone! For example. After I got my first class 10 ship, I figured I'd run a few missions with the GMG. Now I know the Outcasts are going to be bitter about it... after all I'm killing their ships... but come on! does everyone in the world have to hate me? I can Doing missions for the GMG not only lowers your Outcasts faction, but it also screws up your Rhineland experience. Maybe that' understandable? What's not understandable is how when flying back from there, I encountered a Rhineland convoy in Liberty. They attacked me, and to my surprise, the liberty navy joined in. Clearly this is a flaw. Missions have so little going for them as it is... it's asinine to have them destroy your factions all over the universe as a bonus. 
<br />
<br />5) Death is not painful enough. In a PvP environment, there must be tangible risk for the attacker, and not just the poor slob hauling cargo. Likewise, it is often a better idea to just let your ship die than to waste shield batteries and such trying to escape. 
<br />
<br />PvP is horrible in this game, and not because of the combat. One of the lessons learned from Ultima Online is that there MUST be risk for the attacker. If I come after a freighter with my fighter, I have nothing to lose.... and nothing to gain. There must be a REASON to PVP. If you are an anti-PvP crusader just set your flag and be done with it. But those of us who need more than AI ships to deal with need some kind of risk vs reward system. 
<br />
<br />6) Smggling is no more profitable than regular cargo hauling, and you never get caught.
<br />
<br />I've hauled a ton of Cardamine into Manhattan. Just about every time, the cops pull me over... and then I duck into the tradelane and dock in Manhattan. Do cops in the 40th century not have radios? Getting caught with contraband should turn the whole zone red. Getting caught... wether you are caught or not... should lower reputation. Didn't they get your licence plate? The same goes for bandits. Shoot first, ask questions later. You are hauling contraband, that's reason enough to open fire. The same goes for criminals who ask nicely for your cargo. I've got cruise and countermeasures... make me use them.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this gives you mod makers a few ideas. Maybe I can get involved, I have ideas, but no experience modding games. Let me know if you need some help on the conceptual side... and maybe even a little help scripting. I'm hopeless with programming so I can't help you there.</div>

			<div class="content">There aren't many like it in this section. Most posts seem to be from people wanting to fly cruisers and other bull****. Others seem to want more titan-type ships. Clearly the high end ships are overpowered, and often modders of games will simply add more powerful ships and guns. This game is great. It dosen't need a complete overhaul... just a few balance changes.
<br />
<br />Anyways, coming from a guy who requested &quot;Trent Walking&quot; as a mod, I guess I should really consider the source. Great idea man.

			<h3><a href="#p92130" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">my suggestion is just dig in and try changing things, a lot of what you've said has been said before and I'm sure a lot of us agree.  I think a nice solution would be for the difficulty scale to increase along with the player level. I think another good fix would be to change the max weapon and shield classes of all ships to allow for level 10 components.  Fighter, frieghter and heavy fighter L10 shields would have to be added and perhaps really expensive armor upgrades.  Components like better reactor, shields, armor, weapons would be mountable on all ships but it would still be required for you to head out into the border worlds to get level 10 shields, reactors, etc.  I plan on changing this as soon as I get the final game.  Its a lot of tedium changing what is sold on each base, but I think some of these changes would add a lot to the multiplayer as you mentioned.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;I think a nice solution would be for the difficulty scale to increase along with the player level. I think another good fix would be to change the max weapon and shield classes of all ships to allow for level 10 components. Fighter, frieghter and heavy fighter L10 shields would have to be added and perhaps really expensive armor upgrades. Components like better reactor, shields, armor, weapons would be mountable on all ships but it would still be required for you to head out into the border worlds to get level 10 shields, reactors, etc.&quot;
<br />
<br />Yeah that's the problem I see happening. instead of taking away the ships and equipment that makes the game unbalanced, people are going to try and keep the titans and fix &quot;everything else&quot;. It's a lot easier to tune the player's euipment to the environment than it is to tune the environment to suit the insanely overpowered class 10 ships and nomad guns. About the only thing that needs serious beefing up on the AI side is the liberty navy. Those Defenders are a joke... they need a more capable top of the line ship. 
<br />
<br />If nobody else is planning a balance mod similar to this then maybe I will roll up my sleeves and dig in. Frmo what I read it's mostly scripting anyway and not programming... and a monkey can do scripting =)</div>

<br />
<br />Not sure how many modders are working on something that could change some of that for you but I will say this, Im making some changes to the game my self in my own mod for some of the reasons you have stated in your post. 
<br />
<br />I love space games that involve combat and trade and intend to make the best of what we have here in FL.
