			<div class="content">The Deadliest Races Ever Held.
<br />
<br />No other races can equal the danger in these races.
<br />
<br />
<br />There are now races being held on the Jolt Server. 
<br />Some are normal races, the Dublin rings or just a race in a normal system. 
<br />These races have low cash prizes like 50,000 up to 200,000.
<br />
<br />But the special races are the ones for real elite pilots and fighters!
<br />There are numerous different kinds but i will mention a few now:
<br />
<br />The Marathon---A race through the WHOLE of Sirius. Starting from Sigma 13, the racers take all the systems on the outside of Sirius untill they get back.
<br />We know if you try to skip sytems or take shortcuts, we position people at certain 'Choke' systems such as the enterances to Bretonia. If a player doesnt come through and doesnt tell us if they encountered problems or gave up, then we send out a message to all players, putting a bounty of the cheaters head.
<br />Its our way of keeping the rules. Win and get yourself 5 million.So far no one has won this race, all have died.
<br />
<br />Determination----Imagine being chased by 20 ships, all trying to get to you and your fellow racers. We get 20 players in heavy or very heavy fighters and let them chase you or put up road blocks. If you make the 10 system race then you win 3 Million.The people chasing you get 10,000 for their time and if they kill one of you then theyget an extra 100,000.This race has only been won twice, out of 13 times.
<br />
<br />Radiation---The name says it all. A race through some of the worst places for radiation damage. You can stop at two stations along the way to replenish your nanos but if you dock any more times then the other racers will tell us as they can get an extra 200,000 for reporting you. The prize for winning this race is 750,000.
<br />
<br />The Grand Race--- This race will test even the best of players. Racing through minefields, asteriod fields, radiation and gas pocket areas. We rarely ever get more than 4 people in this race, so we give each racer two escorts in Humpbacks(Very good armour), to make sure the racers dont cheat. We also put a 1 million bounty on each of the racers heads. Only one person neared finishing this race. He was 2 systems away from New York when the tradelane he was in was taken down by rouges. These were no problem to the racer in his VHF but the people following him were. He ended up in a dog fight with two other VHF. Our escorts helped the racer with a few shots but werent allowed to fully engage unless fired upon. Unfortunatly for the racer, the other two players knew that the escorts couldnt engage and didnt touch them. (We send out messages warning people about the race every 5 minutes) The racer did a good amount of damage but had used up all his batteries and nanos earlier. In the end he died after an unsucessful run as they caught up with him later in the system. He couldnt repair as you arent allowed to dock.  The prize is 50 million (I only have 43 million but with enterance fees it equals over 60 million)
<br />
<br />Solar Race---A race around the sun! First person to do 20 laps gets 1 million. UNfortunalty, you have to stay inside the chrono and if you leave it you forfeit the race. How much will you risk for 1 million? Also, to keep it fast paced, you must do it in under 2 minutes. It is possible to do that. Infact, the record so far is around a minute and a half. The race has been won 12 out of 14 times so the odds are good. Of course, there are people who hang around and steal your equipment when you die. I cant stop that so its up to you to keep your equipment.
<br />
<br />Planet Surfing---A race in the atmosphere of any planet. It can be any planet so this race is very easy to set up. Like the the Solar race, you must stay in the atmosphere or forfeit the race. 10 laps and get 600,000 for coming first.
<br />You must complete it in under 1 minute 30 seconds.
<br />
<br />Just post to show your interest. There are plenty more races, freight racing, PVP racing etc etc. The list goes on and on.
<br />Again, just ask me for any more info.
<br />

			<div class="content">This is very interesting indeed. I had no idea races like these were happening.
<br />I have 2 questions:
<br />a) How do you apply to be one of the people chasing/blockading/escorting racers?
<br />
<br />b) Did you say all these are on the same server? If so, how do you keep the races apart so nobody accidentally arrives at a scene where another race is being held?

			<div class="content">One race at a time, and if anyone is attaked by a non racer then they tell us and we give em compensation.
<br />
<br />If you want to be one of the blockaders/chasers etc etc, then come to the race b4 it starts and il tell u when to go. 
<br />I send out messeges 5 minutes b4 the races and 10 minutes b4 so u have time
<br />
<br />Also,  the races will begin again in at max a weeks time. Il probobly be ready then. Need to pull in all the favours im owed for these races. Also, a small enterance fee is needed so i dont run out of cash. Of course, clans can sponser the races for advertising etc
<br />
<br />Ive really gotta stop editing this... 
<br />
<br />TOURNEMENTS! Thats it! Big tournements and small ones too. Fighting and racing and other tests of skills!
<br />I will need lots of help to get this going so i would be really gratefull if u helped. (Id pay u or give u free entry etc)
<br />
<br />Just pm me or post here for more info

			<h3><a href="#p345131" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">I said that no one can cheat anyway. People will be positioned at the choke systems. I didnt say that you couldnt use jumpholes. There will be players at all the enterances Into sigma 13. Also, other racers can report you if they see you doing anything wrong. 
<br />
<br />Right, moving on to the tournements. Ive sorted out a few different contests.
<br />
<br />Melee---The more the contestants the better. Only a few rules in this one. A 'Safe' Area for ships which need to let there shields go up. No killing in the safe area and only 2 ships at a time. Also, you are only allowed to use it once.
<br />We dont mind you killing each other but we do allow ransoming. If you manage to 'Capture' another fighter then you have the right to demand a ransom. Of course, the fighter who was captured can pay it or if there are any helpful onlookers then they can pay for it. The fight goes on untill only 2 ships are left.
<br />The two winners can either choose to battle it out for 500,000 or claim 150,000 each. There will be different class melees. Light, Heavy, Very Heavy, Freighter and Open. The open one is for all classes if they want to risk it. The prizes differ for each class. The Open fight prize is only 200,000 but if its a tough fight or a Light fighter wins it then i may bump it up to 500,000 For the fighting skill.
<br />
<br />Also, no races will be in dublin as that track is just boring. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />There are going to be several different types of contests but these are a few.
<br />
<br />Chicken---Two ships start side by side. They have to cruise towards a planet. The first to pull out is the loser. Anyone who hangs back during the way to the planet will lose by default. The prize is 200,000 plus damage compensation.
<br />
<br />Tin Cans---Up to 4 players in this one. There are 10 'Tin Cans' flying around slowly near them. They cant turn their ships but have to try kill the most ships in a time limit or untill all are dead. The 'Tin Can' players are in starfliers. Any person can be one as long as they make a new character and come to me before the event. The prize for winning is 100,000 plus loot. Of course, if you are in a VHF and slaughter all the starfliers then you only get 20,000 which isnt much really. If you are a LF and kill all the tin cans then you would of course get a bonus, i wont say how much, thats for you to find out. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> 
<br />
<br />Those are a few events but there can be as many as you can think of.
<br />
<br />Now onto the jobs for the tournements.
<br />
<br />Contestants---Just come and talk to me for the event list and when they are on. Then just join whichever you want but tell me first so i know if anyone sneaks in half way through the melees. 
<br />
<br />Onlookers---Arrive before or during the events and watch the show. 
<br />
<br />Crowd Control---We need these, believe me. Once after a race, a few supporters claimed that it was rigged and let loose with their VHF's. 10 or more ships were destroyed including the contestants for the frieght race which was due to start after the end of the other race. Luckily the admins arrived and cleared it up. Usual rule, no pvp withen 2k of a station. They just kicked and banned the supporters for 2 weeks. (Thanks admin).  So after that i thought that it would be best to have some muscle to keep everything under control. Just post here to apply for the job. You will be payed and, if you want, given free entry to some of the races. The pay differs on your class of ship and equipment but usually its around 100,000 for a VHF for the small races and then more for the bigger races and events.
<br />
<br />Admins---Thanks for all your help and to show my gratitude you can have free entry to every race.
<br />
<br />Of course, if The Lancers Reactor could post some news on these events then it would really help to bring in the crowds, as this is the most popular site for Freelancer.
<br />
<br />
<br />Again, just post here or pm me for more info or to apply for jobs.</div>
