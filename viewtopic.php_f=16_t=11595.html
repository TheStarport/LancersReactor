			<div class="content">Why are these ships such a PAIN to get?!?!!
<br />
<br />My god.  I've never had so much trouble in any game then it has been to get these ships.
<br />
<br />The first time I wanted to get a really good ship I decided to go for the Titan.  I didn't have much money other than that for the ship but I didn't think I'd have to go through 3 flooded zones of radiation and have to bribe two different peoples just to get it.  It took so many nanobots for me to get into Omega 41 and then out of it that I had nearly no cash left by the time I got out.
<br />
<br />And when I did get out, I found that everyone in Liberty hated me because I had allied with the Corsairs and Red Hessians.  So I flew around to the Outcast base (Who I had also bribed) and found some low level missions there to do.  What's the problem?  Well, my weapons are so weak that I take down their shields about halfway, then they dodge like mad fools until their shields are up to max again, and I take them down to half again.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat.
<br />
<br />So I decide that, okay, I screwed up with the Titan.  I'll just get the Sabre.  It's cheaper, looks better, is more maneuvarable (I like fast ships) and I don't have to go through a bunch of radiation flooded systems to get to it.
<br />
<br />So I gather up 1 million credits and then head off to Dresden, only to find out that the domain is controlled by everyones favorite clan, the Red Hessians.  So after getting blown out of the sky, I decided to go back and bribe the Hessians in New Berlin.  After much re-entering of the bar on New Berlin, I got the bribe for the Red Hessians and started to leave towards Dresden.  As I got halfway out of the docking ring, before I had even gotten control of my ship, everyone in the area decided to shoot at me, and before I knew it, boom, I was dead.  But, being the pilot I am, I moved quickly and avoided them just before I was killed, and managed to get out of there and head for Dresden.
<br />
<br />You see, the lovely Daumaan (sp?) Construction Company went hostile with me when I bribed the Hessians.  And so of course, they run rompant through the exact system I have to travel through to get to the Sabre.  And anytime one of their freighters appear, everyone suddenly feels the need to shoot me down.
<br />
<br />But despite everything, I got to the gate to Dresden, all that was left was to go through, get to the base that had the Sabre and I'd be homefree, as the defence that came with the ship was more than enough to get back through the system.
<br />
<br />So I go through the Dresden gate, only to be met by my friends DC-Whatever.  And then I have the police, the company, and even the stupid gate to go through to Dresden being hostile with me.  I can't get out of Dresden without dying and I can't dock with anything because they're all hostile with me.
<br />
<br />If anyone has any kind of guide, or good way to get either of these ships (Though the Sabre is preferred) I'd GREATLY appreciate if you'd post them for me to read.  Because I've had just about enough of getting shot out of the sky.</div>

			<div class="content">You didn't think strategically.
<br />
<br />I have no idea how far back you have a save game. Unless you are a **** hot pilot you need to up your rep with the various groups that hate the Red Hessins, Corsairs, or Outcasts. Then when you bribe to get your favority pirate group neutral the other various groups wont be so pissed and wont blow you out of virtual space at the first sighting of your sorry ass.
<br />
<br />It is either that or go into GOD mode until you have the ship of your dreams.</div>
