<br />
<br />#212: One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't run with a wooden stake. 
<br />
<br />
<br />#408: I couldn't believe it! Someone had stolen my new sled! My brand-new, all-white sled, with the runners I had painted white and the white tow-rope and my name written on the top, in white. I asked all of my so-called friends which one of them took it, but they all denied it. Finally, in the spring, right after the snow melted, the thief brought it back to where I had left it. 
<br />
<br />
<br />#105: Whether they ever find life there or not, I think Jupiter should be considered an enemy planet. 
<br />
<br />
<br />#220: If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to sign a peace treaty, just as I was signing I'd glance over the treaty and then suddenly act surprised. &quot;Wait a minute! I thought we won!&quot; 
<br />
<br />
<br />#268: If you were a pirate, you know what would be the one thing that would really make you mad? Treasure chests with no handles. How the hell are you supposed to carry it?! 
<br />
<br />#389: I remember I was hammering on a fence in the backyard when Dad approached. He was carrying a letter or something in his hand, and he looked worried. I continued to hammer as he came toward me. &quot;Son,&quot; he said, &quot;why are you hammering on that fence? It already has plenty of nails in it.&quot; &quot;Oh, I'm not using nails,&quot; I replied. &quot;I'm just hammering.&quot; With that, I returned to my hammering. Dad asked me to stop hammering, as he had some news. I did stop hammering, but first I got a couple more hammers in, and this seemed to make Dad mad. &quot;I said, stop hammering!&quot; he yelled. I think he felt bad for yelling at me, especially since it looked like he had bad news. &quot;Look,&quot; he said, &quot;you can hammer later, but first-&quot; Well, I didn't even wait to hear the rest. As soon as I heard &quot;You can hammer,&quot; that's what I started doing. Hammering away, happy as an old hammer dog. Dad tried to physically stop me from hammering by inserting a small log of some sort between my hammer and the fence. But I just kept on hammering, 'cause that's the way I am when I get that hammer going. Then, he just grabbed my arm and made me stop. &quot;I'm afraid I have some news for you,&quot; he said. I swear, what I did next was not hammering. I was just letting the hammer swing lazily at arm's length, and maybe it tapped the fence once or twice, but that's all. That apparently didn't make any difference whatsoever to Dad, because he just grabbed my hammer out of my hand and flung it across the field. And when I saw my hammer flying helplessly through the air like that, I just couldn't take it. I burst out crying, I admit it. And I ran to the house, as fast as my legs could take me. &quot;Son, come back!&quot; yelled Dad. &quot;What about your hammer?!&quot; But I could not have cared less about hammering at that point. I ran into the house and flung myself onto my bed, pounding the bed with my fists. I pounded and pounded, until finally, behind me, I heard a voice. &quot;As long as you're pounding, why not use this?&quot; I turned, and it was Dad, holding a brand-new solid-gold hammer. I quickly wiped the tears from my eyes and ran to Dad's outstretched arms. But suddenly, he jumped out of the way, and I went sailing through the second-story window behind him. Whenever I hear about a kid getting in trouble with drugs, I like to tell him this story. 
<br />
<br />#317: Instead of mousetraps, what about baby traps? Not to harm the babies, but just to hold them down until they can be removed. 
<br />
<br />#417: Mom used to warn me that I could lose an eye playing with BB guns. But she never warned me that I could also lose my BB gun, which I did. 
<br />
<br />
<br />#38: If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong though. It's Hambone. 
<br />
<br />#279: I don't say that the bird is &quot;good&quot; or the bat is &quot;bad.&quot; But I will say this: at least the bird is less nude. 
<br />
<br />
<br />#248: I think there probably should be a rule that if you're talking about how many loaves of bread a bullet will go through, it's understood that you mean lengthwise loaves. Otherwise it makes no sense. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#411: I'll never forget my first true love. She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. From her dark, raven hair to her slender, yellow, scaly feet, she was all woman. She loved corn, and could eat it all day with her hard, yellowish lips. &quot;Caw!&quot; she would yell, as a joke, then flap her arms with delight. One day, she was sitting on a fence, and some guy shot her. 
<br />
<br />
<br />#122: Just as bees will swarm about to protect their nest, so will I &quot;swarm about&quot; to protect my nest of chocolate eggs. 
<br />
<br />#115: If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid seeing yourself in the mirror, because I bet that's what really throws you into a panic. 
<br />

<br />When you go to a restaurant on the weekends and it's busy they start a waiting list. They start calling out names, they say &quot;Dufrane, party of two. Dufrane, party of two.&quot; And if no one answers they'll say their name again. &quot;Dufrane, party of two, Dufrane, party of two.&quot; But then if no one answers they'll just go right on to the next name. &quot;Bush, party of three.&quot; Yeah, what happened to the Dufranes. No one seems to give a ****. Who can eat at a time like this - people are missing. You ****ers are selfish....the Dufranes are in someone's trunk right now, with duct take over their mouths, and they're hungry. Bush, search party of three, you can eat when you find the Dufranes.
