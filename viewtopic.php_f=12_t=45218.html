			<div class="content">yes it's a Jade Goody thread! not really, I loathe her, but it's big news at the moment...
<br />
<br />UK readers will know <i>exactly </i> what this is about, but for the benefit of those in other climes who don't, I'll try to encompass it.
<br />
<br />This years Celebrity Big Brother UK &quot;reality&quot; tv show has been marked by many complaints of racism and racist bullying by members of the &quot;cast&quot; towards another housemate, the really quite beautiful Indian actress and AIDs &amp; PETA campaigner Shilpa Shetty. Foremost amongst those accused of this behaviour is the former BB &quot;star&quot; Jade Goody, an (in)famously stupid, foul-mouthed, overloud pleb who, with the assistance of her svengali-like PR agent, Max Clifford, has up till now shamelessly milked the UK audience for attention and strung out her erstwhile &quot;fame&quot; and made a fair bit of money from it (she's worth a few million now, not bad for a pleb dragged up on a council estate)
<br />
<br />The specific accusations are of references to Ms Shetty's supposed inability to cook to Western standards, supposed lack of hygiene, supposed arrogance, various comments to &quot;f-off back home,&quot; a supposed familiarity with slums, being referred to as &quot;the Indian&quot; and semming deliberate mispronunciation of her name, being called &quot;Shipla Poppadum&quot; and being subjected to an increasing tirade of personal insults the cumulative effect of which has been deemed by many (including me) to be racist in origin and intent, whnether made directly to her or behind her back by Jade Goody and a cabal of &quot;friends&quot; that she gathered amongst the housemates, specifically former Miss Great Britain, Danielle LLoyd, and former S-Club 7 singer Jo O'meara, as well as Jade's boyfriend Jack Tweed who is also resident int he house (he called her a &quot;F-ing P*ki&quot; although the final word was edited out - a YouTube uncensored version clearly shows that this was what he said, though. He claimed it was the word &quot;c*nt&quot; (but why edit that word out and not the preceding, thyey're both equally bad, and C4 has no issue with bad language on BB after the watershed? 
<br />
<br />Last week matters came to a head, the media regulator Ofcom recieved a record number of complaints (including one from me!) and the matter even reached Parliament where questions were asked in the Commons, The Chancellor of the Exchequer was quizzed about it on an official trade visit to India, and there were riots in indian cities. It's whipped up a  real storm. Complaints have also been made to Hertfordshire Police.
<br />
<br />Jade's mother was evicted a couple of weeks ago, she's equally foul, and Jade herself was evicted last Friday and let out to a secured site and studio, no members of the public were present apart from invited guests in the studio. She semmed genuinely shocked by the furore although she knew something was up, and BB seem to have given the housemates some warning about what's been going on as the people in question were being spectacularly nice to Ms Shetty in the last couple of days. However Jade's apology was rather lacking and she denies any racist intent.
<br />
<br />However, that's not the point, and not my argument, although I'll deal with it quickly. It is not the <i>intent </i> claimed or otherwise of a racist remark or act that makes it racist, but the perception of it on the part of the object of the comment or abuse and by extension on the ethnic group or community which that person belongs too. Jade can claim she wasn't being intentionally racist till the cows come home, the fact remains that her comments were racist in nature - they singled out one individual for belittling and humiliation based on references to her ethnic background, even if they didn't mention colour; hence they are racist.
<br />
<br />What I really want to say is that it would appear that Channel 4 and Endemol, the prgramme makers, may have exploited this situation to improve viweing figures; BB is a huge cash cow for C4 and advertisers line up for airtime when its on - althought the main sponsor has withdrawn at the height of the row. Or to be less cynical, maybe C4 just failed to appreciate what was going on and lost control?
<br />
<br />Personally i doubt it; BB is a very controlled environment and the edited highlights which are what most folks tune into are quite cynically manipulated. Back when Jade was first on, she'd been made out to be a drunken, foul, ignorant pig, with pictures of her rolling naked in mud (not a very nice sight) and she became so hated that in fear for her safety afterwards, the programme makers went on a charm offensive and started portraying her mnore positively, as a lovable klutz who said stupid things. The mass media turned her from an object of ridicule into (almost) a low-culture saint, almost overnight! and it is this manufactured perception that she's been cashing in on for the past few years.
<br />
<br />But i was thinking the other day, this is perhaps the first time that a &quot;reality&quot; tv show has given us a genuine glimpse of reality; Jade said nothing you can't hear at work or on the bus any day of the week, her ignorant opinions and prejudices are common coin amongst Britain's white working class. Some have argued that we should thank C4 for bringing to the open this almost unmentionable aspect of our mass society, even if they did exploit it for financial gain. Or should C4 be punished for blatantly exploiting racism, using it to get up their ratings? which it undoubtedly did, have no illusions about that. 
<br />
<br />Opinions? Myself I'd like to see an end to BB and the plague of reality tv shows, but it has at least brought the issue of low-level common racism into the open. As a Muslim I often get comments such as &quot;but you're not a P*ki* or *but you're white* to which i usually answer *so what if I was?* and I witness low-levels of racism all the time at work and in the local community, often by otherwise well-meaning people who although not overtly racist (they don't go poring petrol into Asian families letterboxes, or sport skinheads or swastike tattoos!) yet they still say and do little things that indicate that they don't view non-whites as equals.</div>

			<div class="content">Yeah this made it onto Aussie news services. If you ask me this probably comes down to jealous cat like female behaviour because Shilpa is way fookin hot and assorted british tartlets don't like it, and they use racism as ammunition for their b*tchy behaviour. Personally I think Shilpa has conducted herself with diginity and will see her star on the rise at the end all of this, while the rest will be relegated to sordid bikini photo's in bloke magazines. You never get a big pay day for being a racist b*tch, and they are going to know all about it when they get out.</div>

			<div class="content">Bleh, I despise &quot;BB&quot; and everything attached to it. As for the event described above, not even the Australians could get away from it. It was on the evening news for two nights in a row, the second of which was the all-important &quot;she got voted out 'cause she was one o' dem racists&quot; story *rolls eyes*. In any case, maybe old Mullah-boy has a point; could these artificial, trashy and voyeuristic shows actually be expressing reality on at least some level? Probably not, as it could have been a ploy to spark public interest, but who knows? Either way, I will continue to avoid so-called &quot;reality television&quot; like the plague.

<br />Taw - Creating a thread about this, shame! It is possible that you have fallen for their network's scheme and provided them with free advertising? If so, shame (again)! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">not at all, as you well know; however I've had to listen to various rubbish about it at work, with people saying it wasn't racist, and I finally had enough and expounded (at length and with some force) that it was, with relevant examples and explanations. However it's the wider issue and implications that interest me - that an unpleasant aspect of British mainstream society has been revealed for all to see. Whether that was intentional I very much doubt! but the underlying attitudes and prejudices of the British working-class have been dragged kicking and sceaming into the light of day, and that can't be anything but a good thing, unpleasant as it is. In my area the British National Party gained 5 seats in the local elections a while back, which indicates a/ the lack of mainstream parties to engage with the working-class population, and b/ that racial prejudice and a form of low-level xenophobia persist and can be cynically exploited.
<br />
<br />I'm sure that in the case of BB, the primary motivation for these events was indeed jealousy as Musk Rat points out, but that it was so easily manifested in the form of racism serves to prove that after all this time, racism is still an issue in our society, despite what the politicians may claim.</div>

			<div class="content">Ah yes, Racism. There is so much to say, but little that can be said (TLR rules you know). I'll try to skirt the line...
<br />
<br />Racism is still an issue in Aus. as well, despite internationally-aimed propaganda communicating the contrary, and the well-publicised &quot;Cronulla Riots&quot; and the conflict at the Australian Open are held up and some of the most recent examples (whether or not &quot;Racism&quot; is an accurate description of these events is up to the individual). Indeed, over the last few days there have been a large number of overly-patriotic and (literally) flag-waving types arguing that Australia is &quot;the lucky country&quot;, and that anyone who does not think so is &quot;Unaustralian&quot; (I hate that term). Such thinking is of course, absurd for many reasons, however unsurprising considering Howard's Australia, and the country's now bi-partisan society, in which you either must be &quot;for&quot; the flag (i.e. an Australian) or &quot;against&quot; the flag (i.e. &quot;Unaustralian&quot; and unpatriotic, and probably a violent and disgruntled minority). This was actually spelled out in an interesting opinion piece in today's <i>Age </i> newspaper (<a href='http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/coopting-a-symbol-for-nefarious-purposes/2007/01/23/1169518708001.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1' Target=_Blank>article here</a>). If one does not go along with the Government and express undying love for the (rather uninspired) piece of cloth in question, one is seen as the enemy, and the people that feel this way seem to have a very loud voice. Well, I could go on, but I need to bring this back on topic. Essentially, Racism and rampant Nationalism are still very present in Australia, and t'ain't a good thing.

<br />
<br />While racism has been around for a while (though ramped up with the govt's fear mongering), I can't agree with the rampant nationalism, which has really been a post 9/11 howard induced development. Pre 2001 it was considered rather lacking, which I quite liked to be honest, it was laid back and easy. Now everything is 'unaustralian' (I hate the term too btw), and every muslim is the enemy. We used to embrace multicultrilism, now we've become a bunch of racist knobs drapped in an Australian flag. Y'know, while I never really 'dug' our flag, i've actually began to devolp a distinct distaste for the image, so much is it mis-used. Patriotism in this country has become to 'try-hard' with everyone trying to proove how Australian they are, and it's now something you have to embrace and force upon your neighbour. Either prove your Australian or get out.
<br />
<br />Living life however you see fit, and letting others do the same is about the only thing you should need to embrace to be considered Australian, all this other crap is just un-necessary window dressing.</div>

			<div class="content">Interesting that the thing i took out of that was that ratings would skyrocket following this incident. I was rather hoping that Big Brother would follow the rest of the early-stage Reality TV shows and die by 2012, but it seems now that it will continue heedless (in britan at least)
<br />
<br />Although, to be perfectly honest, this situation does not surprise me in the slightest. Doing away with the inherent non-realism of 'Reality' TV, which is irrelevent in this particular situation, it would only be a matter of time before situations in the real world are protrayed on television. Yet, despite the fact that this sort of thing occurs, the only real uproar occurs when it happens on television, which causes the media to jump on it. No-one cares about the minority child that gets bullied every day at school and nothing gets done about it (And dont tell me that anti-bullying policies work, they don't), Yet everyone gets into a hurrah when an indian woman is insulted on public TV. I ask you, whats the difference?
<br />
<br />Anyway, Sorry for the rant. I must stand next to Esq in his hating of BB. I hate the show, its amazing that such sub-standard TV programming has survived for this long. And that HOST! What's her name... Glittle? Gristle? So annyoing...

<br />Jade Goody got on BB in the first place because she was a figure of ridicule to be exploited - fat, stupid, ignorant, boorish, foul-mouthed, uneducated, impressionable and easily led, with an estuary accent to boot. She proved to be great lowest common denominator TV-fodder and ever since her BB exposure has been used as a &quot;milch-cow&quot; by the common press to make more money. She's the only BB contestant in the Uk to my knowledge who has remained in the public eye and actually built on her &quot;success&quot; - branded perfumes, further tv series with her participatiuon and about her, autobiographies, dvds, charitable sponsorships. She's been a marketing success - till now! I can't help but feel a twinge of <i>schadenfreude </i> that this boorish lump has finally been exposed for what she is, and she did it all herself too <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Now I know how Kyle feels in South Park when Cartman gets his comeuppances!
