			<div class="content">Here's chapter 24 for your reading pleasure.
<br />
<br />hapter 24: Against The Wall
<br />
<br />	Trent still could not believe what had happened, and the fact that his gut instinct about the Dom'Kavash had been proven right wasn't helping things. Amazingly enough, though, the Dom'Kavash had not followed them back to Toledo, and even more surprising was the fact that they had not attempted to contact Trent either.
<br />
<br />	The news coming in from around the colonies was not encouraging either. New jump holes had suddenly opened up all over Sirius, and Nomad warships began pouring  through them. Major skirmishes had broken out, but humanity was for the time being able to hold its own. Trent knew deep down that the stalemate would not last for long.
<br />
<br />	He observed the holo-projector image showing the new jump holes, and listened quietly as Orillion and his senior battle staff discussed possible tactics.
<br />
<br />	A thought suddenly hit Trent like a ton of boron. Cardamine had proven a very effective weapon against the Nomads, and the source of cardamine in Sirius was Malta in Omicron Alpha. If the Dom'Kavash got there first...
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What is it, Colonel Trent?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have to go to Omicron Alpha immediately.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Could you give me a very good reason why?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Because we're going to need all the cardamine we can get our hands on to fight off the Nomads. If the Dom'Kavash get to Malta first, what's to stop them from destroying the planet and our best chance of beating the Nomads?&quot;
<br />
<br />	The room was silent for a moment. Orillion finally broke the silence.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You do realize that cardamine won't help us with the Dom'Kavash, and unless you have the plans to a really big gun, there is no way we can take out the Dom'Kavash dreadnought.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm aware of that, but if we can hold off the Nomads, we'll have more time to deal with the Dom'Kavash.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion didn't reply, but Trent had one more card to play.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What if I can get proof from the Dom'Kavash themselves that's their plan?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;If you can pull that off, then we'll go to Omicron Alpha. Until then I'm not risking what's left of my fleet on a whim.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Be right back.&quot; Trent lapsed into silence as he entered the mind of the Dom'Kavash. He noticed it got easier every time and could do it for long periods of time without feeling the strain.
<br />
<br />	Trent found himself looking at a holographic representation of Sirius, similar to the one he had been looking at on Toledo. Several Dom'Kavash were in this room as well, presumably discussing battle strategy. He listened intently, hoping to hear any clues as to their intentions. 
<br />
<br />	He listened as the Dom'Kavash discussed the successful control of the renegade Nomads, and how they would be used to &quot;cleanse the human virus from our home.&quot; Trent felt himself shudder involuntarily. He heard them discuss how humanity had &quot;failed the test&quot; and they could not be allowed to remain in Sirius.
<br />
<br />	That was good enough for him. Trent withdrew himself from the mind of the Dom'Kavash and found himself back on Toledo.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well?&quot; Orillion asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You're not going to like this at all,&quot; Trent said. He then told Orillion all he had heard.
<br />
<br />	Trent was right. Orillion didn't like it at all.
<br />
<br />-----------------
<br />
<br />	The Operations center had become a tempest of controlled chaos as members of the Order ran to and fro, trying to concoct a plan to repel the Nomads and deal with their Dom'Kavash masters. Orillion stood at his control center overseeing the action taking place all around him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Commander Orillion,&quot; his communications officer called, &quot;you're not going to believe this.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Try me.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We are being hailed by an unknown spacecraft rapidly approaching Toledo. They claim to be Dom'Kavash and say they wish to land and speak with us under a flag of truce.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion looked at Trent with an inquisitive look.
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's news to me,&quot; Trent replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hmm. Any other ships in scanner range?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Negative, just ours.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion pondered this. &quot;Maybe it will be good to parley some and find out what they want. Give them permission to land. I want a full assault team armed to the teeth on the landing pad when they arrive.&quot;
<br />

			<div class="content">Here's chapter 25. Sorry for the delay, but this fan fic seems to be running out of gas, or I'm having a hard time trying to write two.
<br />
<br />Anyway, here you go.
<br />
<br />Chapter 25: Unlikely Help
<br />
<br />	The alien ship slowly descended from the sky, making its way to the landing pad. The armed team Orillion had asked for was stationed around the pad, out of sight, in case anything went wrong.
<br />
<br />	Orillion and Trent stood out in the open. Trent wished that Orillion would quit putting him in situations like this. He was by no means a coward, but he could think of hundreds of other ways he could more profitably risk his life. Orillion had told him that since Trent was the only on who seemed to be able to communicate with the Dom'Kavash in any form, that automatically made his presence necessary.
<br />
<br />	The Dom'Kavash spacecraft set down on the pad, and for the first time the Order could get a good close look at a Dom'Kavash spacecraft. Trent had to admit he was a little disappointed. The ship was simple in desigh, shaped much like the triangular-shaped fighter craft he had seen before. The ship shared the bluish hull color of the fighter craft, but was larger overall. It reminded Trent of the Rheinland gunboats he had faced two years before.
<br />
<br />	A hatchway opened on the underside of the ship, and three figures made their way out. Trent couldn't help but feel a sense of pride mixed in with his apprehension, knowing that he was among the first to be making this first contact with another race. He watched as the tall slender insectlike figures strode over to where Trent and Orillion waited them. Trent had seen the Dom'Kavash before, of course, but actually seeing them with his own eyes was something that Trent would never forget.
<br />
<br />	The Dom'Kavash in front raised his clawed hand in greeting.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Greetings. We come here to speak under a pact of truce.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent was shocked. He was hearing the voice not in his head, but with his own ears. He ventured a glance at Orillion, who had a look of surprise as well. Apparently he had also heard them speak.
<br />
<br />	&quot;On behalf of Humanity, I welcome you,&quot; Orillion replied. &quot;What is it you wish to speak to us about?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;There is much we must discuss,&quot; the Dom'Kavash replied, &quot;and we have come here under great risk to speak with you.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I do not understand.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We shall explain what we can, but it may take some time.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Of course. Please, follow me.&quot; Orillion led them into the base. Trent followed behind the delegation with his head spinning. There was so many questions he wanted answered, and now it looked like it might actually happen.
<br />
<br />	The delegation entered a large conference room and sat down, the Dom'Kavash at one end and the humans at the other. Trent took a seat next to Orillion.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I can deduce that your first question for us is how we are able to communicate,&quot; the Dom'Kavash said. &quot;In order to simplify the process of communication, we decided to adapt to your vocal style rather than the mind-to-mind style we adapted for use with your Trent.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Your next question will obviosly address why we have come, will it not?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;That is correct,&quot; Orillion replied. Trent noticed that Orillion looked slightly uneasy, but that was because he knew Orillion well. Anyone who was seeing Orillion for the first time would not notice anything but a calm, collected man.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We are here because we wish to help.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent could contain himself no longer. &quot;Help? What do you mean, help?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have, for lack of a better term, separated ourselves from our brethren. We feel that their xenophobic attitude toward your race is...misguided.&quot; 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Really? You thingk&quot; Trent shot back angrily. Orillion gave him an icy look.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We understand your feelings of anger toward us, but perhaps after we have given our explanation your anger will be satiated.
<br />
<br />	&quot;When we first arrived in this area of space, we were attacked by two fleets: Our old adversaries, whom you call the Nomads, and a group of humans you refer to as Corsairs. We were forced to assume that they were in league, and responded in kind.
<br />
<br />	&quot;By destroying an entire planet and millions of people?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;In our defense, neither I or my comrades here this day participated in the making of that decision. I can only offer our apologies and sympathy for those who have been lost.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Now, if I may continue. After the incident, there was much debate concerning the human race. Some thought that this was an isolated incident and we should continue to seek an alliance with the humans. Others thought that the incident proved humans could not be trusted. The debate continued while we fought our old enemies. We discovered several planets where the Nomads had established colonies and moved to destroy them. We succeded in eliminating one, but we were taken by surprise at the level of resistance we encountered at another.
<br />
<br />	&quot;After much time, our scientists were able to discover a way to bring the Nomads back under our control. Once that was accomplished, it was decided that since the Nomads were no longer a problem, the humans would no longer be needed as allies. Our leaders decided that the human race would be 'relocated' to other worlds beyond our ancient home---those who refused would be eliminated. They summoned you to the Dyson Sphere, I believe you call it, to test your willingness to comply. Needless to say, your sudden departure from the sphere surprised many of my kind.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We are aware of the mental link the Supreme Commander established with you, Trent, and we are also aware that you have discovered how to make this link work in the opposite direction. You should know, Trent, that this places you in a very dangerous position. For that reason we have established a temporary mind block to prevent the Supreme Commander from contacting you, and you from contacting him. Later we will make this block permanent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;This is all wonderful information,&quot; Orillioin interrupted, &quot;but you still have not told us what your intentions are.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have betrayed our own kind to bring you this information, and to offer you our assistance, for we know how to defeat our own kind. We will not allow our leaders to resort to genocide.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;How can we trust you?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I cannot convince you to trust us, but maybe this will be of some value.&quot; The Dom'Kavash leader produced an artifact simialr to the one Trent had received two years ago.
<br />
<br />	&quot;This contains the complete database of our mother ship, including structural diagrams. We will show you the weaknesses of the ship and how to exploit them. All we ask in return is you grant us a place where we few can live out our lives in peace.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion was silent, pondering the offer. He looked at Trent, who felt for some strange reason that these creature could be trusted, even though he had no reason to trust them. He nodded.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very well,&quot; Orillion finally said. &quot;Let's get to work, then.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />---You're just jealous because the voices in my head don't speak to you!</div>
