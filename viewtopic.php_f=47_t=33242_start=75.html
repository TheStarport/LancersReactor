			<div class="content">Sorry all for the long wait on chapter 12. This is not my most favourite chapter on my series but i promise this is the beginning of the build up to the conclusion of my fanfic. I should have 13 ready shortly. I don't think 13 will be very long. I hope you all like 12 though. Here it is.
<br />
<br />Chapter 12 &#8211; Scouts Honour
<br />
<br />It was 0700hrs on the Osiris.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Will all senior personnel please report to the docking bay&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent rolled over and shook Juni gently.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Juni&#8221; said Trent. &#8220;Juni, wake up we&#8217;ve gotta go&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Humh, what time is it?&#8221; asked Juni sleepily.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Its 7 in the morning. We&#8217;ve got to go to the docking bay&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent rolled out of bed and threw his clothes on. Juni followed a few minutes later.
<br />
<br />Juni and Trent were the first to meet Orillion and Halap&#8217;onmelep in the docking bay.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Be patient Trent. We&#8217;ll wait for the others&#8221; replied Orillion.
<br />
<br />It was 10 minutes before everyone had arrived on the docking bay. King was suffering from a bad hangover.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok everyone, listen up. Liberty have been contacted regarding their cloaking system. They are unable to mass produce the cloaking technology in the short period of time that we need&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What!?&#8221; shouted King. &#8220;How are we supposed to travel through the Nomad systems in safety?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Halap&#8217;onmelep and I have been discussing plans to re configure their cloaking field frequencies to match that of the Osiris. He has been in contact with his ship and Dom Kavash engineers have so far been successful in matching the frequencies. They have already launched scouting vessels through 5 of the Jump Holes and are due to report back on their Mother Ship shortly. We are to meet them there in 1 hour to discuss the findings and the way forward. I suggest you eat then meet back here in 50. Dismissed.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Everyone left the docking bay to go to the mess hall. The Osiris chef was serving synth paste with a synth paste garnish.
<br />
<br />After everyone had finished eating, they met with Orillion, Sinclair and Quintaine in the Docking bay. There was an Order transport waiting for them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Lets go.&#8221; Said Orillion. &#8220;They are waiting for us&#8221;
<br />
<br />Everyone got on board the Transport. The Osiris was only a 1000k from the Dom Kavash mother ship.
<br />
<br />The huge docking bay doors opened and the Transport glided in gently and set itself down in the docking bay. Halap&#8217;onmelep was waiting.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you for coming&#8221; he said as Orillion came out of the Transport. &#8220;The scouts are waiting in tactical. Please, follow me.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent was familiar with the surroundings of the Dom Kavash vessel. This time, he wasn&#8217;t there as a stranger. 
<br />
<br />Much like his first visit, there was a long walk to tactical.
<br />
<br />They entered tactical where the 5 Dom Kavash scouts were waiting. The Dom Kavash had seats waiting for the Order members.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Please sit&#8221; said Halap&#8217;onmelep.
<br />
<br />He turned to the 5 scouts. &#8220;Please report your findings&#8221;
<br />
<br />Each of the scouts described what they had seen. Nomad fleets had begun a huge build up in two of the five systems. In the other 3, Nomad scouts had been found patrolling the systems. No Nomad structures had been found. Halap spoke to them in Kavashian and the scouts left tactical.
<br />
<br />He looked at Orillion. &#8220;What do you suggest?&#8221; He asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It is a big concern that Nomad fleets are amassing in two of the systems. What is more concerning is where they are coming from.&#8221; Replied Orillion. &#8220;Have the other scouts begun their searches?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes. They are due back shortly&#8221;
<br />
<br />No more than 30 minutes passed for the return of 5 of the scouts. They entered tactical and spoke of much the same. The systems they had visited were being patrolled by Nomad scouts.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Any reports on the other two scouts?&#8221; asked Hakkera.
<br />&#8220;No. They were due back&#8230;&#8221;
<br />
<br />Suddenly, one of the Dom Kavash crew members came barging in through tactical. He looked afraid.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Halap, we have word the one of the scouts has been destroyed. The other is heavily damaged and is coming back now.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked Halap.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Unknown&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very well. Thank you.&#8221; Replied Halap. &#8220;We shall meet the survivor in the docking bay&#8221;
<br />
<br />Everyone got out to leave and they made their way to the docking bay. The dom Kavash scout ship was badly damaged.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Report scout&#8221; Shouted Halap.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Cloaking device failed. Nomad Shipyard. Nomad City. Hundreds of Nomads.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The scout had come from the Jump Hole King and Von Claussen had been investigating.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What happened to the other scout?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br /> &#8220;Nomad Scouts in an adjoining system. Cloaking device failure,&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well it looks like we now know our target. I will ask for reinforcement from the houses.&#8221; Said Orillion. 
<br /> 
<br />&#8220;Good. As promised, we shall give you our weapons technology. It will be a fine addition to your ships. We shall prepare our attack forces throughout the system. I suggest you bring your ships here so we can modify them. Go back to yours and contact your species. We will meet here when you are ready to plan our attack&#8221; said Halap.
<br />
<br />Orillion boarded the Transport and made his way back to the Osiris. Everyone else remained on the Dom Kavash mother ship. 
<br />

			<div class="content">Sorry for the late entry of Chapter 13. I had a real bad headache come on late yesterday afternoon so i have been working on 13 since 11am. I hope you all like this one. 
<br />
<br />Chapter 13 &#8211; Revelations
<br />
<br />
<br />Orillion landed safely back on the Osiris and made his way to Communications. 
<br />
<br />Liberty was too far away for him to make direct contact with President Jacobi, but with Hathor back in friendly space on the other side of the Hyper Gate, he could relay the message to Liberty and the other 4 houses.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Research Base Hathor, this is Orillion, please come in&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Research Base Hathor here sir&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Get word to the 5 houses, Nomad threat serious, request immediate reinforcements&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes sir&#8221;
<br />
<br />Orillion left communications. He hoped that the houses could rally enough forces quickly to help them.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, on the Dom Kavash Mother ship, Trent, Juni, Hakkera, Von Claussen, Sinclair and Quintaine were being given a guided tour by Halap.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wow, this place is amazing. In all the years I have been studying you and your artefacts, I never expected your ship to be like this&#8221; exclaimed Sinclair.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you. It took many years to create what we have here&#8221; replied Halap.
<br />
<br />They made their way to the ships bridge. 
<br />
<br />Halap turned to Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We never thanked you for helping us. It will no doubt be a great day for both our species when the time comes to end the plague that is the Nomads&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent nodded in acceptance of Halaps thank you.
<br />
<br />&#8220;When we conducted scans of this system, we found a large debris field not far from the hyper gate. Can you tell us what it is or what it was?&#8221; asked Quintaine as he passed Halap the data console he had been carrying with him.
<br />
<br />Halap looked at the console. &#8220;It was one of our outposts. After the activation of the hyper gate system, we constructed it as a research base&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What were you researching?&#8221; asked Sinclair curiously.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Maybe now is the time that we told you the whole truth about exactly what we are up against. Your leader should come on board&#8221;
<br />
<br />Orillion was contacted on the Osiris and he made his way to the Dom Kavash mother ship. He met with the others on the bridge.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about?&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />Trent filled Orillion in on what had lead to him being summoned to the mother ship.
<br />
<br />&#8220;When our species first passed through the hyper gate in to this system, we began our research in to creating a species to protect our home that we were leaving.&#8221; explained Halap.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Nomads&#8221; said Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Replied Halap. &#8220;As you know, our research was a success. We had created an aggressive alien species capable of successfully defending our home. What ensued from our research was catastrophic. The Nomads were able to adapt to any situation, any technology and live in the most hostile of atmosphere&#8217;s. We quickly began to lose control. What ensued was a war that had all but eradicated our peaceful species. Unable to cope with the relentless attacks of the Nomads, we fled our home in hope of survival and we passed through the hyper gate system, locking it behind us&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What was being researched at your base Halap&#8221; asked Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;In the hope of re colonizing our home, we knew we couldn&#8217;t destroy the Nomads. Research begun on creating a more evolved and even more aggressive strand of Nomad DNA, a species which we would have control over, that could help us re take our home. Not learning from our previous mistakes the new Nomad strain attacked us once more. Knowing that we actually had more numbers than they had, due to the early research of the new strain, they fled. That was 200 years ago and they have multiplied. We destroyed the research base, forever condemning our evil research. Un aware that your species had colonized our home, when you activated the Hyper Gate system, the Nomad fighters passed through here. The fighters that we have encountered so far are the remainders of the ones you sent through two years ago, our original creation. We have yet to encounter the more advanced strain&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;This just gets better and better&#8221; said Trent. &#8220;You told me that years of exploration had caused you numbers to lower!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Once we had met you, we knew your species aggression, and your victory over the Nomads two years ago, would be able to help us in destroying our creations. If we told you there was a more advanced strain, we thought you wouldn&#8217;t help us&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Damn straight we wouldn&#8217;t help you!&#8221; shouted Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Colonel Trent!&#8221; said Orillion. &#8220;This is not the time to get angry&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent calmed down.
<br />
<br />&#8220;How serious is this threat?&#8221; asked Orillion
<br />
<br />&#8220;Very&#8221; replied Halap. &#8220;The second Nomad strain was created for the sole purpose of re claiming our home.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are they the ones who have set up home beyond the Jump Hole?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Halap paused for a moment and looked at the floor shamefully.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes&#8221;
<br />
<br />There were groans and disrepute among The Order members Hakkera, Trent, Von Claussen, Juni, King, Sinclair and Quintaine.
<br />
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok settle down people. I think we need to update the colonies as to the situation we have here&#8221; said Orillion. &#8220;I will head back to the Osiris and contact Hathor. It will be a few days before the House militaries can mobilize their forces. Halap, I want you and your engineers to begin updating our weapon and shield technologies. Everybody else is to return to the Osiris with me&quot;
<br />
<br />Everyone left the bridge and made their way to the Osiris transport.</div>

			<div class="content">Here it is. The eve of the eve of the end of my fanfic. I've decided to finish on chapter 15. 16 will be the end intro. Advance notice now - 15 will be the longest chapter in the series, and together with 16, i hope to round off my fanfic. If at the end, like throughout this, i get a good response, a sequel will not be ruled out. Anywho, enjoy chapter 14.
<br />
<br />Chapter 14 &#8211; The Armada
<br />
<br />
<br />Once more the transport landed safely on the Osiris.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ok people, we will meet on the bridge in 5. I will send a communication to Hathor&#8221;
<br />
<br />Orillion made his way to communications while Trent, Juni, King, Von Claussen, Hakkera, Sinclair and Quintaine made their way to the bridge.
<br />
<br />Orillion joined them shortly after.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Hispanic fleet is already on the other side of the hyper gate. We have word that Rheinland has refused use of its ships. Bretonia, Liberty and Kusari vessels are en route and will meet up with the Hispanic fleet tomorrow&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why have Rheinland refused ships?&#8221; asked Von Claussen.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We destroyed much of the Rheinland military 2 years ago and they do not have the forces they once had.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Do we know how many ships are due to rendezvous in the Dyson Sphere?&#8221; asked Juni.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Unknown Colonel Zane. The houses will probably send a huge bulk of their forces to help us. We also have reinforcements coming from Toledo&#8221; replied Orillion. &#8220;The next few days are going to be rough. I suggest you all get some rest. We must be ready to welcome the fleets by 1000hrs.
<br />
<br />Orillion left the bridge and made his back to his quarters.
<br />
<br />Everyone else made their way to the Osiris bar. Cobo and Kress were already sitting down with drinks. Trent ordered a round a brought them to the table.
<br />
<br />&#8220;See Trent. I told you we shouldn&#8217;t have come&#8221; said King.
<br />
<br />Trent looked down at his glass. For the first time in his life, he didn&#8217;t want to drink his Sidewinder Fang.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What do you think our chances are of surviving this?&#8221; Cobo asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Slim&#8221; replied Trent glumly. &#8220;We stood a good chance against the Nomads we had already won against. But with another form of Nomad, one we haven&#8217;t seen, who knows.&#8221;
<br />
<br />There was very little talk at the table. Every bodies minds where on the days ahead. 
<br />
<br />Juni and Trent were the first to leave. They made their way back to Trent&#8217;s quarters and sat down on his bed.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I want to stay with you tonight Trent&#8221; said Juni. Her concerns for what was coming were clearly evident. Trent gave her hug.
<br />
<br />&#8220;When this is over, I&#8217;ll take you to Hawaii in Sigma 19&#8221; whispered Trent. 
<br />
<br />It was unlike Juni to be this afraid. Trent wouldn&#8217;t deny he felt the same. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Trent&#8217;s neural net alarm woke him at 0830hrs. He could already here the movement of Order personnel outside his quarters. Juni was already awake.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Are you ok?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep. You should get ready. I&#8217;ve already spoken to Orillion. He wants us on the bridge at 0900hrs.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent threw his stuff together and was ready in 20 minutes. Before they left Trent kissed Juni. He had been thinking about it. He was more afraid of losing Juni than he was dying.
<br />
<br />They made their way together to the bridge of the Osiris. Orillion was waiting.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Trent, Juni, thank you for coming. I have a special assignment for the two of you&#8221; said Orillion.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;As The Orders two most experienced pilots, I want you two to welcome the fleet.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sounds good&#8221; said Trent. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;ll be accompanied by Halap and 2 of his escorts. I will also be sending Cobo and Kress to go with you. I already have word that the fleet has remodulated their shields for hyper gate travel and they will be awaiting you clearance to jump. You are to leave immediately. Halap is waiting for you in the docking bay. Good luck&#8221;
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni made their way to the docking. Sure enough Halap and two of his escorts were waiting. Cobo and Kress were already in space
<br />
<br />&#8220;Shall we proceed?&#8221; said Halap.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes&#8221; replied Trent. He still wasn&#8217;t happy at being lied to by Halap.
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni&#8217;s Anubis&#8217;s were waiting on the docking bay pad.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We have made the required modifications to your ships. We have had to modify our own weapons to make them more useful. Their rate of fire is far more efficient than your current weapon load out. We have also increased your shield integrity and modified our ships with your communications technology.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you Halap&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />Trent, Juni Halap and his escorts launched into space.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We thought you had bugged out!&#8221; said Kress over the comms.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No chance Colonel!&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Everyone, enter formation, we a fleet to meet&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />They engaged cruise speed and made it to the hyper gate entrance without a glitch. Trent was gagging to try his new weapons.
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is Order pilot Colonel Trent. Your are clear for safe passage fleet&#8221; 
<br />
<br />The hyper gate came to life. What passed through amazed Trent, Juni, Cobo and Kress.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My god&#8221; said Juni over the private comms to Trent. &#8220;It looks the entire Liberty fleet!&#8221;
<br />
<br />10 Liberty Battleships passed through the hyper gate. 25 Cruisers and over 100 Defenders and Patriots accompanied them. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Colonel Trent. This is Liberty Navy Battleship Washington Captain O&#8217;Hara speaking. Our forces have successfully jumped through the hyper gate. The Kusari, Bretonian and Hispanic fleets are waiting on the other side&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Its good to see you over here Washington. Your help will certainly be needed&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />The Liberty Navy cleared the Hyper Gate as it came alive as the Kusari fleet passed through.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Wow, it looks the houses have taken this threat very seriously&#8221; said Juni.
<br />
<br />5 Kusari Battleships, 30 gunboats, 50 Drakes and 30 Dragons passed through in to the Hyper Gate system.
<br />
<br />Next was the Hispanic fleet. It was comprised of the best veteran pilots the Corsairs and Outcasts could send through. 30 Daggers, 30 Sabres, 40 Centurions and 20 Titans. 
<br />
<br />Finally the Bretonian Armed Forces. 
<br />
<br />Bretonia had sent through the bulk of their Navy. Much like Liberty. 15 Bretonian Battleships, 50 Crusaders and 20 Cavaliers. Trent knew one of the battleships. Before long the captain of the Battleship Hood came over Trent&#8217;s comm.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Ah Bretonian. To yella to come back and race your old pal eh? Said Captain Dexter Hovis.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hovis!? How the hell did you get into the Bretonian Navy?&#8221; replied Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not. Me and the boys thought we&#8217;d tag along for a while. We have the Nomads at 100/1 outsiders in this one. I have someone here that would like to talk to you&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Trent.
<br /> 
<br />&#8220;Its good to see you boy!&#8221; said Tobias.
<br />
<br />Meeting Hovis and Tobias had knocked Trent back a little. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tobias! What are you doing on the Hood!&#8221; asked Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;An old man needs to keep himself occupied Trent&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I thought the Hood was no longer operational&#8221; said Trent.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t. We struck gold. Literally and we carried out the repairs ourselves&#8221; said Hovis.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m impressed. You certainly did a great job&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you Bretonian&#8221; replied Hovis.
<br />
<br />Trent got over the group communications so he could talk with all the ships. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sirius Fleet, this is Colonel Trent. For centuries, mankind has battled against all the odds that have been placed in front us. Today, we will be faced with the odds once more. But like all the challenges that have befallen us before, none of them ever claimed a victory over the shear determination and resilience of the human race. Our victory over the Nomads will just be another chapter in mankind&#8217;s history&#8221;
<br />
<br />Loud cheers could be heard over the communications.
<br />
<br />&#8220;That was a bit much wouldn&#8217;t you say?&#8221; said Juni jokingly. The shear size of the Sirius fleet that had passed through lifted the dread she had been feeling.
<br />
<br />&#8220;If I die, then every hero needs to be remembered by his battle speech!&#8221; said Trent sarcastically.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh brother!&#8221; laughed Juni.
<br />
<br />They plotted a course back to the Osiris.
<br />
