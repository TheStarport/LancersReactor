			<div class="content">Hi Dreyus!
<br />
<br />You really shocked me, as these bugs you mentioned are major bugs and I would have been very stupid to miss them.
<br />
<br />But I have simply to say that this is not true!
<br />
<br />I don't want to offend you, but I checked it three times and everytime everything was okay and none of the bugs you mentioned appeared.
<br />
<br />I even downloaded the mod and the patch from TLR, to see if maybe during the upload something went wrong. But still none of your bugs was in the mod.
<br />
<br />So, this seems to be a problem of your PC.
<br />
<br />Of course I'll try to help you to fix this:
<br />
<br />1. Do you have any other mod active except of &quot;The Monkeys 1.18&quot; and &quot;OpenSP for the Monkeys&quot; (You can also play without the OpenSP of course). If so, please deactivate all other mods, as I cannot guarantee that my mod works together with any other mod.
<br />
<br />2. If the problem is still there, try to do a fresh install of FL, download the mod and the patch again (Even without the patch these bugs shouldn't appear, but the patch fixes another bug, so that you should download it anyway). Then activate them both and start a new game (If you don't want to do the story again, just activate my &quot;OpenSP for the Monkeys&quot; Mod). Do not use old savegames, as they will probably not work.
<br />
<br />If you tried this, please post here if you were successful, so that I can see what was the problem, or can help you, if all this still does not work!
<br />
<br />Thanks and good luck!
<br />
<br />If anyone else has problems, please try at first all this, as I do not want to say these things again and again!!!
<br />
<br />Many thanks for playing my mod and for helping me improving it.
<br />
<br />Black Eagle</div>

			<div class="content">Sorry to shock you. I am doing a complete Unsinstall of Freelancer FLMM and all just in case. For the record, none of these things appeared before the patching, so I think that must've been it. Didn't mean to be insulting, the mod is great, the bugs I mentioned seemed reletively minor to me. 
<br />
<br />I'll try the game again in a bit, the reinstall will likely take forever. 
<br />
<br />I have few things to let out about this mod (all good pretty much<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) but it's loaded with spoilers, and I'm wondering if I can post that here, or should I email to you?

			<div class="content">Well I'm rounding out my reinstall with the Monkeys Patch...and it won't overwrite the old one! it just makes a new mod under the same name, and makes a new folder with name TheMonkeys1 (1). Umm for now I'm gonna move the stuff from the patch into the TheMonkeys1 original and overwrite whats needs to be overwritten. Hopefully thats right thing to do. My computer's acting really weird lately. I'll let you know how it turns out. And get back to me on commenting, I have a few questions and even few suggestions.</div>

			<div class="content">Okay!
<br />
<br />Maybe you should try to get your computer working normal at first!
<br />
<br />Noone else reported those bugs and on my computer they do not appear. So, it is very likely, that they are not caused by my mod, but by something else on your computer.
<br />
<br />Any suggestions or questions are welcome. Just post them here!
<br />
<br />One other thing, if you don't want to do a fresh install of FL, do at least a &quot;restore backups&quot; in FLMM!
<br />
<br />And of course overwriting is the right thing. But normally the patch should not create it's own folder. Maybe the folder of the mod is write-protected. Try to disable this and the patch should overwrite the old files. If not, you can just do it manually as you said, but then I think something is really strange with your PC (you should check for viruses) !
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

			<h3><a href="#p359102" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Well thanks for the overwriting help. The folder was set as read-only. 
<br />
<br />And I tried restoring backups, always do when I change mods. But that didn't work either so I reinstalled evrything Freelancer related....and the freighter is still gone from the opening --_--.
<br />
<br />Virus scan, adware scan and even a defrag and HDD test are on the way. I seem to have bad luck with computers =/. I don't think anythings wrong with it, it's just very slow, which is unusual because it used to run Freelancer (and everything else) pretty fine. 
<br />
<br />And here are those comment, questions and suggestions. Of course there are purely my opinion<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> and you can make what you will of it. If theres anything else I can help with or do I'd be happy to help.
<br />
<br />-First off, thanks for the great black market, it's practically a necessity with the sky high prices.
<br />- Your a devious wreck placer<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> other than the six in Robot 1, I couldn't find any other new ones. Is there more?
<br />- The infocards of the Nomads Shields say tha pulsar shields protect against all weapons better, is that true of Nomad weapons as well? And by what factor does the protection increase?
<br />- Pretty much the same questions as above, does the Monkey/Order V.H.F. Shield provide more protection against Nomad lasers, same for the Carbon Alloy Hull Improvement?
<br />- Is the Crusher supposed to be near invincible<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>? The two shields insure that the shields stay off for roughly three seconds, the first time and then after that they constantly recharge in about 2 seconds! I only tried this prior to the patch though. Although I can see it as beign a necessity against a squad of N1's although you really shouldn't be attempting that in a Crusher...
<br />- Speaking of sky high prices, repairs have gone up by quite a bit. in a fully equipped Anubis MKII, repair costs exceeded half a million credits from a simple radiation zone! I believe this is due to the great but expensive Nomad gear costing and Mokey weapons costings some 25000 each to repair. More of a warning to those saving up than than a suggestion.
<br />- I noticed the Order lacks their own...uniqueness. The Robots and their all powerful arrogance and focus on speed. The Nomads and their hard hitting weaponry and super gear and the Monkeys with their magnificent weapons. Yet the Order lacks something special. Unfortunately I have no idea what unique characteristic too add? Possibly the hardest missions or some such. Something that struck me as largely fitting would be the Code Name weapons, developed by humans in secret, so why shouldn't order have them? Orillion is of course from the &quot;deepest, darkest&quot; of Liberty, he should know of them, and possibly improve them. Of course maybe I just missed whats so special about the Order.
<br />- And lastly, the Nomad laser weapons are like mini torpedos each, with those damage numbers. And they eat energy like popcorn, which is fine, except that those weapons also have no range! Only 600m! The Nomad Turret has LESS! Which doesnt make sense because turrets should have slightly more range than their laser counterparts (usually an increase of 50m I think). I believe the Nomad weapons are weaker than ALL the other weapons because they have two weaknesses, power hungryness and lack of range. The huge punch doesnt pay off because you still have to shoot all ships many times because of nanobot  and shield battery regeneration, so a two hit kill is nigh impossible. Thats usually the benifit of such super powerful, low refire rate weapons, but its deminished because of nanbots and shield batteries. I was thinking you could extend the range of nomad weapons far beyond the other weapons, so a Nomad could force you to use your nanobots and shield batteries sooner and therefore even out the field.
<br />
<br />Well thats my little rant. Hope it helps somewhat. Coolest mod I've played yet<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Creative stuff.
<br />
<br />Edit: Two more!
<br />- The bartender on the Robot homeworld (Robotronic I think?) spoke of his old days as a Discoverer pilot, and wrecks he found with amazing weapons to make life easier. Do these wrecks exist as of yet or were the 6 wrecks in Robot 1 it?
<br />- And is it your intention to add a Campagin? The story-line is incredibly in-depth and I think it's quite possible.

			<h3><a href="#p359346" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Hi to all of you!
<br />
<br />Dreyus: It's good to hear that your game and the mods work now.
<br />
<br />For your suggestions:
<br />
<br />1. For now there are only the wrecks in Robot 1. Sorry, but I simply did not have the time to place more. In the next version, every new system will have several wrecks and maybe even some of the old systems will have new ones.
<br />
<br />2. Nomad Pulsar shields protect against all normal weapons (Laser, Photon, Particle, Tachyon, Pulse, Plasma and Neutron) and the Robot weapons better than normal (These weapons do 0.8 of the normal damage). As Nomad weapons are still lasers (maybe I will change this) they also do less damage to Nomad Pulsar shields. Only Monkey weapons do increased damage (1.4) to Nomad shields.
<br />
<br />3. The Monkey/Order VHF shield is a Graviton shield, which provides increased protection against lasers. So also against Nomad lasers.
<br />The Carbon Alloy Armor does only increase the hull strength of your ship. All weapons do the same damage to the hull and therefore also to the Armor improvement.
<br />
<br />4. The Crusher costs MUCH money and should therefore be able to stand against several Nomad N1s or Mysteres. As it is really big and slow, the enemy will hit you with every shot. Therefore it needs really strong shields, which also rebuild very fast to be worth the money.
<br />The Crusher is for those, who want to fly a capitalship and want to be able to stand against small VHF wings and other capitalships. If you are attacked by several VHF wings (for example the Monkeys and the Robots) it is still very hard to not die and even harder to win the battle without fleeing. And of course the Crusher has no Countermeasure Dropper, which makes it vulnerable to Missiles and CDs.
<br />So, in my opinion it is not to strong, as you can fly it and stand against some enemies, but still can also destroy enemy crushers.
<br />
<br />5. I know that the prices in my mod are quite high, but therefore you get a bit higher mission payments and there are now some traderoutes, which are very valuable. For example the for national contrabands (Ancient Kusari Ceramics Declaration of Independence, Viking Weapons, Crown Jewels) bring the maximum profit of 2400 Cr if you find the right traderoute. So with a Conqueror, you can make 240000 Cr in one run!
<br />I think with this it is quite easy to make much money very fast, so that you can afford the best equipment and also repair it.
<br />
<br />6. The thing with the Order is a good idea. I will think about how to make them unique. But I will still let them be the connection between the normal factions from Sirius and the Monkeys and Robots. Otherwise it would be a too large step between Corsairs/Outcasts and Monkeys/Robots.
<br />But I already gave the Order an own shield and a new ship. Thanks also for the good idea with the Codename weapons.
<br />I will also try to give the Nomads some more unique equipment.
<br />
<br />7. In comparison to the Monkey and Robot weapons the Nomad weapons are of course not so good. The idea of increasing their range is very good, thanks.
<br />But I also gave them something very special and good.
<br />They have the second best Minedropper, a cruisedisruptor, which is in my opinion even better than the Hornet and a strong torpedo. All these weapons are the only ones of their kind, which need no ammo! This is in my opinion quite a special and strong thing.
<br />But as I said, increasing the range of their lasers might be a good idea.
<br />
<br />8. The Bartender spoke about the six wrecks in Robot 1 and about some others that will come in the next versions <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  (Some of them will even have unique weapons and equipment, which you cannot buy anywhere)
<br />
<br />9. Creating a new storyline is possible, but very difficult and much work. As I still have a list with 50!!! major additions, I want to add to the mod and as I hardly have the time to make even one of them, I will not add new story missions.
<br />But of course I will go on with adding texts and stories to every ship, planet, station, system, nebula, etc.
<br />So, I will tell a little story that you can read in all the infocards. I already got some nice ideas for the Nomads, the Monkeys and the Order.
<br />And of course the Robots are still doing research on the Nomads, which they once created <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Many thanks again for all the good ideas and suggestions. It's good to get these from others, as they help to improve the mod.
<br />I hope you aggree with me in these points. If not, just post it here.
<br />I would like to see you here sometimes!!!
<br />
<br />Vader and King Lin: I hope your computers will be OK soon.
<br />
<br />How do you like the new additions and are there some things you don't like or miss?
<br />
<br />It would be great to hear of you!
<br />
<br />And Vader: Do you want to go on with your fan fiction for the Monkeys? I really liked the first part!
<br />
<br />I have to go now (school work <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> See you around!

			<h3><a href="#p359593" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">All those suggestions I made seem to be in order for you which is good. I hope you realize I'm not expecting these things anytime soon, so no worries there. 
<br />
<br /> 1. The wrecks wasn't an problem, it was merely a curiosity. I await your future wrecks with interest<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /> 2. For the shields, you might want to have the Robots do either 1.0 or 1.2 times factor damage because they after all understand the Nomads the best, so they should be a bit above the others, though not the Monkeys though, as they have weapon specialties.
<br />
<br /> 3. I was just curious about the Carbon Alloy upgrade because it said it specially protected against Nomad lasers.
<br />
<br /> 5. The prices are quite fair, it just means that if in a combat ship you have to do both missioons AND frieghting on the side to make some profit. It's highly suggestable for anyone coming into these sysytems the first time to have around at least 4 million credits. It's not hard, just a bit tedious. There is a a freighter run that nets 600 000 credits per run through only a single jumphole  and the bases beign 7 and 50k from the jumphole on either side. Not bad at all! Just be sure to make use of the great black market<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /> 6. I'm not sure what you mean by a gap between the new factions and the 
<br />original ones in Siruis. If its a storyline gap, I'm unsure of what your planning or even what to do. Seems like something is going to be done during a storyline campaign as the news said Orillion was headed to the Major house planets to speak with leaders. If it's the power difference then I'll speak of that in a little bit.
<br />
<br /> 7. I'm aware of what you did to balance the four new factions, and it works quite well. All four have their specialties, the Nomads and their special equiptment (the NPCs don't seem to use them with any effectiveness, but thats alright seeing as they more than make up for it in sheer numbers and tenacity), the Robots have their incredible speed and superior piloting skills and the Monkeys have their superior firepower<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. I am currently unsure of the Order's specialty..that's why I brought up the validity of their uniqueness. I'm not sure what could fix this but by hisotrically human policies (as the Order is the only one of the new factions thats human still) something obcenely large and powerful is on the mark. Maybe a full size Capital ship or well, super defensive stationary structures like improved weapon platforms or some such. That would actually tie into a storyline nicely as it would allow the other factions to congregate and in all likelyhood destroy the Nomad base or whatever the storyline objective is. Anyways, all the new factions have one key strength that they spam and abuse to be superior to the others and all the non special abilities (ie. Speed for the Nomads and Monkeys because Robots specialty is speed, excluding exceptions like the Mystere of course) are relitively even. An Anubis Mk II can relitively keep up with a a Valkyrie N1 and have better Monkey firepower but not the N1's special weapons. Unfortunately the gap is that Robot, Monkey and Order weapons (not too sure about the Order weapons) are all superior in their effectiveness to Nomad weapons. This really isn't fair because the Monkeys should be the only one drastically superior. And of course I'm not speaking in simple terms of pure damage, but damage, speed, range etc all in one. In a rating the Nomads would probably rank the poorest, which is I think unfair.
<br />
<br /> 8. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Something to look forward to.
<br />
<br /> 9. Creating a new storyline is purely a concept idea. I don't think a complete one has been even done yet, but I've only tried a few mods so I'm not sure. But this mod easily has storyline potential and I wanted you to recgoonize that so you can expand on that later if you wish, but of course it may or may not be likely juging by the amount of work that needs to go into it. I just wanted to bring it your attention, so the story doesn't get lost by accident in some future update somehow or some other weird occurence.
<br />
<br />Lastly #4 kinda ties in with a bunch of other things, so I left it for last. It also involves multiple concepts that are concepts still, I want others opinions on these ones esspecially because their purely my opinion, which really isn't valid for the whole audience of this mod. 
<br />
<br />The Crusher (and Amun) are two capital ships, both costing above 6 million for a fully equipped ship (as the weaapons cannot be bought seperatly). To me personally theres a number of issues with both of these ships and in many cases capital ships in general.
<br />
<br />The Crusher and Amun both have twin shields and hulls aorund the 75000 mark (That's 187 500 with armour upgrades!) so these bad boys can take soem punishment, something that's completely valid and probably should stay that way as it put's them above the type of fighting that goes on between fighter class ships. 
<br />
<br />Traditionally a fighter cannot defeat a capital ship in open combat. It either shouldn't be possible or in the case of classic Starlancer, require some sort of intrinsic method of destruction that requires special skills (destrcution of shield generater, and special squad drops in massive torpedos). Obvilously the Starlancer method is impossible since you can't select individual parts of capital ships, but the capital ship detroying torpedos can now be found on standard fighters. 
<br />
<br />However captial ships in Freelancer strangely lack a punch of their own. They can of course take large amounts of regular firepower (esspecially &quot;Heavy&quot; class cruisers such as the LIberty Dreadnought) excluding the torpedo weapons as they were made specifically for them. So the defense of the capital ships is fine, but the offense is sorely lacking. Captial ship turrents never do in excess of 1000 damage for the four Major Houses. And yet these ships were supposed to be of terrifying strength, yet they serve only a walls in the way since their weapons aren't damaging. Even the Nomad ships only have weapon strength of only 1600. The regen rate alone of shields that should even consider going head ot head (Very Heavy Fighters, I guess Heavy firghters are more support fighters than specialized) are roughly 200-300 or even higher in some cases. Only an optmial outfitted ship would consider fighting one of higher class (ie. only a Heavy fighter carrying it's best weapons would want to fight a Very Heavy Fighter with any frequency, of course, this is in terms of sheer firepower). I'm basing all of this on pure firepower, so skill would obvilously nullify many of these tings, which I feel is valid because skill superceeds the standard boundaries of anything. 
<br />
<br />So I suggest that captial ships be upgraded to a point where only Very Heavy Fighters with multiple torpedo hardpoints can engage them sucessfully (although Heavy Fighters and even Advanced Light Fighters can support them with a single torpedo). I'm not totally sure how that will be accomplished *exactly* as of yet, but it'll will likely involve giving Capital ships special improved nanobots (and of course Nomad Rebuild Cells) that increase their hulls at a much higer rate, give them enough to withstand an encounter with a wing of Light or even Heavy Fighters but not from Very Heavy Fighters. 
<br />
<br />The same applies to gunboats of course, only that Heavy Fighters should be able to encounter them with possibility of winning but not Light Fighters. I believe theres a Realistic Battleship mod out there but it's labeled with (cheap) on the end so I haven't tried it yet. All of this connects back to the Crusher and Amun because you classified them as capital ships. Their size and power suggest that they are gunboats. However they have shields, so they are vastly superior, but at the same time they use standard nanobots and shield batteries. So they really are gunboats, but they suffer from the same lack of power that all non-fighter freighters do. That's what brought all of this to my attention. 
<br />
<br />What I'm suggesting is making all gunboats and capital ships increased in gun strength, to actively destroy a single ship with 3-7 consecutive shots (changable variable), making any attempt to destroy them risky indeed. Also not to make capital ships invincible to lower class ships but to prolong the battle so much that for a lower class ship to survive it must require skill not just circling and constantly shooting. Nanobots and Rebuild Cells are perfect for it because it heals them but will eventually run out, making anything killable by anything, which is ultimately what we want.
<br />
<br />Of course I will try and look into this my self with my mediocre modding skllls and hope to supply you with any necessary numbers, IF everyone agrees to this. And of course any recommendations or changes are welcome.
<br />
<br />Lastly I have one last possible change that I want to get everyone else's opinion on this. First time I saw the opening with Cure for the Itch playing i thought that the Thoth there was the Anubis Mk II ! For some reason I think it fits more. Esspecially since the Anubis Mk II has the same hull as the original Anubis. I also think it's valid because neither the Monkeys or Robots need a friegther as the Amun and Crusher already have massive cargo holds and even then the weapons can be stripped to hold even more during emergency where the ship can be escorted unarmed. 
<br />
<br />A few more things concerning the Thoth is that is has three cockpits! Although it looks pretty cool, when you land and there three people piloting it, it looks really weird. Also when piloting the Thoth, the ship looks unusually large in comparison to other ships, yet it isn't when you land. I suspect an adjustment of the camera could fix that, unless it was intended. Lastly converting the Thoth to a fighter would not be very difficult. I think the two turrent mounts on sides facing out of the lower engines where there appears to be platforms just for them, should remain as turrets, but the rest be converted to forward firing only gun points. And that the thruster hardpoing be placed right at the back and middle of the Thoth as there is no engine there and would be the balanced place to put it.
<br />
<br />Wow, this is a long post, and is in no way meant to critisize your mod, but simply offer my opinion on an improvment. I'd like to get opinions from Vader and King Lin aswell (and anyone else too!) on these things.
<br />And to those with computer problems, could you specify exactly whats wrong so maybe I can attempt to come up with a solution?  Thanks all around. Sorry for the insanely long post, hope I didn't bore people <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sleepy.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">Thanks Dreyus!
<br />
<br />You do not need to fear that I could misunderstand your post. It may be long, but there are good points in it. I'm really thankful that you help me to improve the mod and you are mentioning really good points with very good arguments for your opinion.
<br />Now lets start <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />1. I think that I was a bit lazy before placing only six wrecks in the game, but as I said in the next version there will be more and I hope you'll like them.
<br />
<br />2. It is right that the Robots know very much about the Nomads, as they once created them. My thought was at first that the Monkeys developed special weapons against the Nomad shields, which would also fit to their specialty, which is superior weapon power.
<br />The Robots got weapons that are good against all the normal shield classes and therefore would be to strong, if they are also good against Nomad shields. But maybe I can change this a bit to keep it realistic (They should do more damage to Nomad shields, as they know them quite good). So, I'll see what I can improve
<br />
<br />3. The text is just tricking you. Of course it is the second best armor in the game and increases your hull quite a lot, but there is no special protection against the Nomad lasers.
<br />
<br />5. Of course you have to use the blackmarket. That's why I added so many new contraband commodities to increase the players possibilities. An of course I don't want any new player to be able to buy a Crusher or an Amun after two hours of playing.
<br />
<br />6. The gap that I mean is a technology gap. The weapons and shields of the Corsairs/Outcasts, which are the strongest from the colonies are much weaker than the weapons and shields of the Monkeys, Robots and Nomads. So there should be a faction, which has equipment that is a bit better than the Corsair/Outcast equipment, but still weaker than the Monkey/Robot/Nomad equipment.
<br />I already got a basic idea, how to make the Order more special, but still keeping them the way I want it. But I have to try some things and see if it is good.
<br />
<br />7. Actually at the beginning I only wanted to have three different choices for the player.
<br />The Monkeys with superior weapons and shields.
<br />The Robots with superior speed and agility and also the best torpedo.
<br />The Nomads with special equipment (which is used by the NPCs; e.g.: Nomad VHFs fire Nomad torpedoes on you, which hit you quite often if you do not use CMs), large cargoroom (Valkyrie N1) and hundreds of ships
<br />
<br />As I did not include new trops/CDs, the Robots have only the speed for now and the Nomads will also get some more special equipment.
<br />And then there is the Order: I simply did not focus on them, but as I said I got an idea.
<br />
<br />So, in the next version I think I will have these four major forces with the following specialties:
<br />
<br />The Monkeys with superior firepower and the strongest shields.
<br />
<br />The Robots with the fastest and most agile ships and also the strongest torpedo (stronger than the Nomad one, but slower and not so agile).
<br />
<br />The Nomads with the largest cargoroom (in VHFs and also in one new freighter, which will then have the largest cargoroom of all freighters) and some special equipment (no ammo equipment, the fast Nomad torpedo, which can even be used against fighters, etc.)
<br />
<br />THE FIRST IDEA
<br />The Order with special ships for different situations: a bomber with about six torpedo mounts against capitalships, two &quot;fighterkillers&quot; (one is a fighter, which is very fast and agile and can have strong weapons against fighters, but therefore no additional equipment and weak shields; the other is a capitalship, which has only anti-fighter weapons and cannot stand against VHFs and other capitalships)
<br />
<br />OR THE OTHER IDEA
<br />The Order with special weapons. These would be codenameweapons, which could for example do enormous amounts of hull damage but no shield damage, or both, but with very high energy consumption and slow refire rate, etc.
<br />
<br />So, what do you think about this. I also have some other specialties I could add, but I'm not sure where to add and have to think about this.
<br />
<br />So I hope that I will be able to have four new forces, which all have specialties and are of similar strenght!
<br />
<br />8. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I already did some new unique weapons during the last days!
<br />
<br />9. In every release of my mod the story I tell in the infocards will somehow go on and I will develop it. I personally do not like mods that add thousands of ships and systems, but have no infocards or only very basic ones. I want to tell a story, which makes the game more interesting. But creating new missions is just to difficult and takes to much time. I'm quite sure that I will not do this.
<br />I hope you like my little stories I tell with all the infocards and you can be sure that everything new will have it's own story, like in the last versions.
<br />
<br />Now 4:
<br />At first: I personally do not like capitalships or at least I do not like player controlled capitalships. First Freelancer was not made for player controlled capitalships and therefore there will be problems all the time (docking with stations, weapon classes, etc.). Second I think that a good player would always prefer a fighter as in a one-on-one the fighter pilot would surely win. Capitalships are just too slow, too big, not agile enough and they would need very fast and also strong weapons to stand against fighters. For a player, in my opinion capitalships are getting boring very fast as he only sits there relying on the strong shields and hull and shoots around with its turrets without moving very much. None of the special movement maneuvers is possible with a capitalship. So, capitalships are good for NPCs so that the player can kill them (then there are several capships and most times also a fighter escort), but they should not be pilotable for the player.
<br />I would not have included these two ships, if there were not many people, who asked me to do this. Therefore I decided to include somehow &quot;fake&quot; capships. The Crusher and the Amun are both as big as a gunboat and still quite fast and agile. I would never fly them, but I think it is ok to have them in the mod. I will maybe even add some other pilotable capships, but I will never make battleships pilotable maybe not even cruisers.
<br />If anyone does not like this just say it here and we can talk about it!
<br />
<br />So, now that you know, how I think about capships I can answer to your post. I tried to add the two capships in a way that they fit in the mod and the original game and are balanced.
<br />
<br />I already thought about increasing the price, as you get a fully equipped ship. If you buy and Anubis and equip it with the best equipment, you also need around 3-4 millions. So maybe the capships should be a bit more expensive. But I'm not sure about this.
<br />
<br />As you said the armor and shield is quite high, but just right for this kind of ship (they get hit much more often then fighters, as they are slow and big. This is also a reason why they need good armor and shields, which are strong AND have a fast rebuild rate).
<br />
<br />Of course capships of the four houses are not very good in offensive, but I already increased this and you should think about that even low level players will sometimes have to fight them and should at least have the chance to flee. So the house capships cannot be so strong. In my opinion if you try to attack Rheinland or Kusari capships with a Titan the fight will not be too easy and also Bretonia and Liberty are a small challenge.
<br />But of course there are the Nomad, Robot and Monkey capships:
<br />The Nomad capships have very strong weapons, but the projectiles are too slow. I laready thought about making them faster, but there is one important thing:
<br />I want a single player to be able to play my mod and stand against anny enemy he will find (Of course not if there are several wings, but at least one group of ships should not be too much for a player) and I want also players, which have &quot;only&quot; a Titan or Sabre to be able to stand at least for a short time and some battles in the new systems. So the new capships must not be too strong.
<br />This is, why you may find the new capships too weak, if flying an Anubis, a Mystere or a similar ship.
<br />
<br />The Nomad capships, I will try to improve, but the Crusher and the Amun are just good in my opinion.
<br />They both have anti-fighter weapons, missiles, which are also good against fighters, anti-capitalship weapons and a lot of armor and shield.
<br />The only thing, which is a bit problematic are the NPCs, as they are not yet able to pilot these two ships in a good way. I will work on this, to improve also these two new capships. But I think the ships with their stats and weapons are quite good as they are.
<br />
<br />But you also had one very good point, which I will include in the mod. I will make capitalship shields much more resistent to fighter weapons to increase the effect of torpedoes. A class ten light fighter (like the Discoverer) should normally not be able to destroy a capitalship. This should be the task of VHFs or bombers (I want to add some ships with sveral torpedo hardpoints, which are then somehow a new class bombers and good against capships).
<br />So, I will make capitalships less weak against energy weapons, but I will ad stronger torpedoes.
<br />
<br />The idea with special nanobots is a good one, but unfortunately not possible. I'm not sure, if I could create a new kind of Nanobots, which can be used by players (the Nomad rebuild cells only work for NPCs). But I'm totally sure that I cannot restrict these nanobots to capships. So everyone could use them and therefore this idea is impossible to include, sorry.
<br />
<br />One thing for the Crusher and Amun. They may have the size of gunboats, but they are classified as Cruiser/Destroyer, as they have the strentgh of these ships. So the size is not important but the strenght and use.
<br />
<br />Quote:&quot;What I'm suggesting is making all gunboats and capital ships increased in gun strength, to actively destroy a single ship with 3-7 consecutive shots (changable variable), making any attempt to destroy them risky indeed. Also not to make capital ships invincible to lower class ships but to prolong the battle so much that for a lower class ship to survive it must require skill not just circling and constantly shooting. Nanobots and Rebuild Cells are perfect for it because it heals them but will eventually run out, making anything killable by anything, which is ultimately what we want.&quot;
<br />
<br />This is a good conclusion and even if my suggestions above may have some differences I aggree with you. I will do some of this and also some of my ideas, as I think that sometimes the mod must be unrealistic to be still entertaining and interesting to play.
<br />So, about capships: I will change them and they will be good against fighters and other capships. The only danger will be large wings of VHFs and bombers and other capships. I will try to add some of your points, which are better than some of mine, but also keep some of my ideas, which I prefer to others of yours.
<br />
<br />Now to the Thoth: Her I have to say that I do not aggree with you. In my opinion a freighter for the Monkeys (in the next version also for the Nomads and Robots and maybe also the Order) is quite useful and the Thoth fits into the mod. The Amun and the Crusher are capships that cannot dock on stations (cannot trade everywhere), are quite expensive and mainly for fighting. So a freighter is still needed to have a fast and cheap method to trade larger amounts of goods (maybe I will even decrease the cargohold of the Crusher and Amun).
<br />
<br />I also like the three cockpits and the three pilots as it looks like you had some crew on the ship. The size is also ok for me as it is a big freighter with a large cargohold. And finally the turrets fit to a freighter.
<br />So, I like the ship as it is and think it is good, but If still don't you might ask some others, if they also want me to change this. I hope you can understand my points.
<br />
<br />So... Also a very, very, very... long post from me. Maybe I sometimes wrote a bit short or it is hard to understnad, but I was a bit tired already as I began to write this. So, just ask or write back if there is something wrong.
<br />
<br />Again, many thanks for all the good suggestions. It's really a great help for me and I would like to hear your opinion about my answers.
<br />
<br />See you around!

<br />For your fan fiction. I think that not bp, but Eraser is responsible for fan fiction. This is E-mail address:

<br />Maybe you should try to send it to him. In my opinion they will get it up, but maybe they need some time, as they are quite busy with so many other things and do great work for TLR!
<br />
<br />I'm really waiting eagerly for the next chapter of your story!
<br />
<br />Everything allright with the mod now? I hope I did not miss any other bugs and the mod is fun to play now.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry that your comp is still messed up King Lin. What exactly is your problem, maybe we can help you. (You know, I just want you to play my mod <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I have two weeks of vacation now, but I have still much work for school. I will mod a bit, but probably not so much. In about two months I will have more time to really start with the next version.

<br />That's it for now!
