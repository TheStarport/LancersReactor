			<div class="content">I've read a whole load of Fan fiction here and I decided to try my own. I'm not planning to puit another Chapter unless you want me to. Could you also give some constructive criticism? Thanks.
<br />And Voila!
<br />
<br />Coldblade Darkstorm, Known by his few friends as &#8220;Frosty&#8221; for his cold nature, walked slowly into the bar of Birmingham Station. He was a Freelancer, doing what he wanted, where he wanted, and had a 20,000 credit Bounty on his head. Of course, that was because he had been preying on Bounty Hunter Patrols for Months now, around Sheffield station, getting thousands of Credits worth of Equipment, H-fuel and more. He was not a trader, per se, but killed those who attacked him, and sold their goods for money, and often sold to the Corsairs. Indeed, they were his best customers. His eyes, an icy blue, swept the Bar, looking for a job. Finding none, he returned to his ship, a Corsair Legionnaire Light Fighter armed with Pyros and Ripper cannons, and the best shield money could buy. The docking gates slowly opened, and he drifted out, then headed for the Jump Hole for the Leeds system. He had a cargo hold full of Optronics, and was going to Cambridge to sell them for a huge profit.
<br />&#8220;Freelancer Alpha One Dash Eight, this is Birmingham Station. You are cleared to launch. Good flying.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Acknowledged, Birmingham Station, proceeding to launch.&#8221; Frosty launched from the station, setting a course for the nearby Trade Lane, going to the New London system Jump Gate. As he docked with the Lane, the familiar swirl of colors enfolded his ship. It was excellent indeed to be returning home to Cadiz Base. It would be a journey of a few days, but time was not an issue. He also had a few goods to drop off at Mactan Base. Coldblade was in truth a Rheinlander, but was declared persona non grata when he was seen flying with corsairs. He then fled with his CSV into Liberty, where he developed a good friendship with the Liberty Police, until he was caught with a cargo hold full of Cardamine and Artifacts. That was when he was kicked out of Liberty, but thankfully with the Cardamine and Artifacts. They had cost a fortune, and it was a waste to let them go. He hightailed it out of there, via the Magellan Jump Hole and a bit of cover from his rogue and outcast friends. He got to New London with only a few problems, one of which was a patrolling Liberty Gunboat and a couple of Bounty Hunter Piranhas. He then landed on New London and started a new chapter in his life&#8230; He soon became close friends with the criminals of Bretonia, excepting the Mollys and the Gaians, as his activities were not to their taste. His mind ran through this while his ship&#8217;s engines went into Cruise mode. All of a sudden, the Legionnaire immediately dropped out of cruise mode. Momentarily surprised, he checked his scanners and Combat Log and saw that there was a Bounty Hunter Patrol in pursuit, and had just hit him with a Cruise Disrupter. Swearing, he powered up his weapons and turned to the enemies&#8217; incoming vector. On their incoming run, He destroyed one of the four piranhas with energy weapons and obliterated another&#8217;s shield, while they opened fire with their laser weapons. He then launched a fire-and-forget Windstalker missile and attempted to destroy the three Barracudas. It was a difficult fight, but using a large supply of missiles and mines, he defeated them all over a period of ten minutes. At the end, he had run through 8 of his shield batteries and 3 nanobot caches. Sighing, he then set a course for the Trade Lane once again and entered without further ado.
<br />
<br />	After making his way to the Cambridge system, he flew to the Magellan system, or more specifically to Mactan Base, the home of the Lane Hackers. He then retired to his sleeping quarters for a few hours of peace. Before he dozed off, he thought about the Bounty Hunter attack&#8230;. It was strange that they would come after him like that. It was not a regular patrol, that was certain, as no patrol he had ambushed had that many ships. No, It was a hunting mission. That was when it struck him. He was a wanted man. For Coldblade, it was time to move on. Only time could tell what would happen to him. He could no longer play both sides of the table. He had to make a choice.

			<div class="content">Excellent story! Indeed you should write another story. But with more talking and action. This was a great prelude. The next chapter should be longer. I did find an error though. When you said: 
<br />
<br />The docking gates slowly opened, and he drifted out, then headed for the Jump Hole for the Leeds system. He had a cargo hold full of Optronics, and was going to Cambridge to sell them for a huge profit.
<br />&#8220;Freelancer Alpha One Dash Eight, this is Birmingham Station. You are cleared to launch. Good flying.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Acknowledged, Birmingham Station, proceeding to launch.&#8221; Frosty launched from the station, setting a course for the nearby Trade Lane, going to the New London system Jump Gate.
<br />
<br />
<br />You said he launched twice. Once: 
<br />The docking gates slowly opened, and he drifted out...
<br />
<br />twice:
<br />&#8220;Acknowledged, Birmingham Station, proceeding to launch.&#8221; Frosty launched from the station...
<br />
<br />a couple grammer errors, but over all, this is a GREAT story. 
<br />Good luck with the rest. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Well, thanks for the support guys. I tried to plan a few stories ahead a few months back, but I got a new comp cause my computer's hard drive got corrupted, and lost everything. Grade 9 is also very taxing, and I apologise for me not being here recently... I just haven't had time. I just can't envision where this story will go, so, I've decided to make a new one, in a different thread which I will try to update once every 2-3 weeks with a new chapter, If you like it.
