			<div class="content">We have so many depressing conversations here in TLR, people complaining about work and school, moaning about women, people worried about life in general.  Sometimes I read the Off Topic threads and think &quot;what the hell is going on?  Do you have to moan to prove your worth as a man?  Get a life!&quot;
<br />
<br />I want to know more about you guys...I want to know what in this world makes you happy.  I don't want this to be a spam fest, I want honest answers.  I don't want to hear &quot;when I spend 4 hours in one full on FL battle and manage to come out of it shields intact&quot; or &quot;when the wife goes out&quot; or even &quot;being between the legs of a good woman&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Confused? Let me explain...
<br />
<br />I want absolutely genuine honest answers.  I want you to think back at the last time you really opened your eyes to the world.  When for a split second you consume the world and it consumes you.  You might be lucky enough to say that you were stood on a hillside at sunrise and for a moment it took your breathe away....but you could easily say &quot;I woke up in the morning in a good mood anyway, things just felt right.  Then I stepped out of the front door and the sun hit my face and there was a gentle breeze in the air, and for a moment all was right in the world&quot;.
<br />
<br />I want you to think.  Think hard.  And if you say that you've never experienced a moment in your life when this has happened, you are absolutely 100% lieing or your memory is worse than mine <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  So come on guys, do me proud.
<br />
<br />Come on people, go to your happy place...
<br />
<br />EDIT:  Come on, by now it should be obvious emoticons in the subject don't last.  Give the mods a break guys and gals.

			<div class="content">The last time was Sunday weekend before last at a frisbee tournament in london (no... bear with me here <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ). I had been off sport for 2 months due to nearly breaking my ankle and this was the first exercise i was getting. Although it was late Jan. It was warm (once you got playing), no rain but not bright sun so that you couldn't see the disk. not too much wind, but a little to make it interesting and because it had been wet the night before, the ground was perfect for laying out on. So although to most people it would be a dull sort of day, it was perfect weather for the activity I was doing and I was very happy to be getting back to that activity anyway. Pity about the next day when i could hardly move because my calf muscles had contracted to the size of brussel sprouts...

<br />Must admit, when my two old housemates come back from their hospital placements things will pick up a little more - which means i will be in a permanent state of happyness, but at the moment i am pretty darned happy anyway. I could moan about wanting stuff/missing stuff - but its nothing bad really. I can live without what i don't have, and i am keeping myself entertained at the moment. Do miss getting drunk every other night though <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">c'mon guys, I was expecting specifics here...corsair and zone hit it right on the nose and ff was definitely on his way there.
<br />
<br />Anyone can say that they're pretty happy at the moment, goddamnit so am I!  But I was kinda looking for a &quot;moment of happiness&quot; rather than a general life statement.
<br />
<br />I'll give you and example, something that happened to me the other day.  I was out walking with my gf and we decided to sit down for a few minutes in a field.  The sky was blue and there was a real chill in the air...but we were both wrapped up warm so it was kinda cosy.  We sat for a couple of minutes and said nothing...absolutely nothing...just sat there and took in the moment.  For that short period in time all was right in the world...everything was...for want of a better word...happy.
<br />
<br />Of course after 2 minutes my gf started to moan about wedding arrangements, which in turn resulted in a blazing argument, but thats beside the point <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />The point is, life is just a series of moments, share a good one.  To quote Mr Ferris Bueller...&quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Well, two very specific moments of sheer happiness for me:
<br />
<br />1. The moment I saw my wife on my wedding day in her white wedding gown. It was such a special feeling and she looked so damn beautiful in that dress.... Well, I felt so happy and fortunate to marry this girl <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> The rest of the day was very beautiful and happy too of course.
<br />
<br />2. The birth of my daughter Lotte. My wife unfortunately had a miscarriage the first time she was pregnant (she was like 10 weeks pregnant or so). Then when she got pregnant again, it was really stressful during the following 9 months as you can imagine. Right from the start she got bleedings. Turned out to be her placenta which was laying very low in her uterus and that caused the bleedings. But every single time the bleeding occurred, we obviously got scarred as hell there might be something wrong again. I've been in the hospital for about 40 times during that 9 months for check ups and at one point they even made a mistake by telling us our baby had died (at 6 months pregnancy). We were absolutely devastated. After about 10 minutes they found out their mistake and they told us the baby was still alive. I was ready to kill someone as you can imagine. 
<br />
<br />After 9 months of this tiring and terrifying nightmare, the moment came where my wife got contractions. Then these contractions went on for 3 weeks! We found out some time later, that she had a cystitis and that the contractions were due to that and had nothing to do with the baby. Then they prescribed antibiotics (with penicillin), but they forgot to look in her medical file. She is highly allergic to penicillin! Luckely she always reads the instructions, so she found out this grave mistake before taking it, but if she had taken it, she could have gone into a shock or a coma or maybe even worse....not to mention the danger towards the baby! But at last, she went into labour and after hours of countless painful contractions, our daughter Lotte was born. We both looked at her and then at eachother and after all we had been through, emotions raised to the roof! I had never felt so incredibly fortunate and happy in my life before <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

<br />
<br />Second, As I am a Night person I have most of my fun at night, The Last moment of Happiness was about 4 Years ago when my little cousin was born, I felt so happy I danced with Joy and screamed it ou to the world, but what I enjoy is mostly reading about everything and all.
<br />
<br />I have had not so many moments of genuine happiness, but there are a few to name, but they are all Sex related so I have to search deeper.... Oh yes, One true Moment of Happiness was when I graduated school, after all those years I could dance with joy because I finally did it, another moment was when I (sorry this has to be sex related) Told a Life long friend of mine I was in love with him,
<br />Thank the gods that he responded the way I predicted, he wasn't with me but he was willing to have a relationship, it lasted for 14 glorious months and ended in the beginning of 2003, I am still a friend of his as he is of mine.

<br />Erm, I cannot compete, mainly as i am useless material for a bf - so no woman really wants to date me (don't get me wrong, i aint ugly, but also no oil painting either, its just that we all get on so damned well......yada yada yada), so i don't have any of those types. Mine are more mundane every day sort of things.
<br />
<br />I think some would be:
<br />
<br />A) After 3 months of hard research for 10hours a day, i stood up infront of around 150 people to give my final year presentation upon the manufacture of Glucose Oxidase Biosensors. The audience wasn't just my fellow students - there were only 25 on the course. It consisted of all lecturers, research staff, other departments lectures, representatives of the companies that we researched for (everyone had a different company), representatives of unrelated industries (our department has exceedingly good links to industry), and representatives of the Association of Clothworkers guild (who donated 1 mil for an extension to the faculty!) - so to put it mildly - they wanted to see how good we were. 
<br />
<br />I got up after watching 10 other good presentations, and started mine on what was a &quot;cutting edge field of research&quot; (basically blood sugar testing strips that would cost next to nothing, be 100% disposable and stable to be kept in fridge for months). Nerves - hell yeah, i am not a very confident person!. 
<br />
<br />Anyways - I gave my supposed 20 minute presentation on the topic, which involved slides, computer images, samples and more - all the while delivering a dialogue running throughout on the processes, results and conclusions.
<br />
<br />After the 20 mins questions could be fielded. The most others had got were 2 questions - but usually only one - and bloody simple ones that poeple NOT doing the research could answer.
<br />
<br />Somehow i got over 22 questions that lasted for more than 20 mins (I was the last presentation that day, so they let the questions run......). They ranged from the mundane of &quot;what is the most expensive component in the manufacture&quot; - which i said &quot;Glucose Oxidase&quot; and was then told by an expert that i might want to reconsider. I asked why, and he quoted the &quot;perhaps the silver electrodes would be more expensive&quot; to which i gave the smart alec reply of &quot;they would, if we used them, but ours were graphite based <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>&quot;. I don't think that helped me too much.
<br />
<br />Anyway - question after questions ranging all the way up to explanations for anomolous results, variables that weren't investigated, why glucose oxidase was used when glucose dihydrogenase was presenting better results initially, how did we ensure even print levels, and ink jet nozzle diameter affecting the method along with ferrocyanide crystalisation on nozzles and sonic cleaning were asked.
<br />
<br />I got torn to shreds by questions, and everyone sat in silence. I got commisserations at the end from my fellow course mates - as they thought i had been abused, and picked upon.
<br />
<br />
<br />So.....feeling like complete s*** for about a week, i went to collect my results. I had a mark that was over 89% for my presentation, with the next nearest being about 70%. seeing as one girl is a complete nerd and averaged 95% in exams etc, i totally whooped her and everyone else.
<br />
<br />That was probabily my finest hour at uni (well apart from completing the Otely run twice in a weekend, and over 20 times during my uni stint (12 pub pub crawl - we once did it in 7 hours). I thought i had failed, it turned out i had given one of the best &quot;lectures&quot; they had ever seen from a student.
<br />
<br />
<br />The only other one was probabily my first lesson observation by my university tutor at the school. I enjoyed teaching alot, but it really whacked alot out of me. I spent about two days working my butt off on one lesson. Needless to say, for once, the kids were genuinely interested. They behaved, all my techniques worked, i showed 'outstanding potential for teaching' - and after stress city for the past two months, it was a real morale booster and confidence booster <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>(a senior female teacher at the school hated me as soon as she first saw me, and dedicated her time to trying to ruin me. She even interuptted lessons to tell me that my previous lesson was not good enough and that she was going to fail me. Not only incredibly unprofessional but also a blazen attack against my confidence/competance as a teacher. Needless to say, I passed that school quite nicely!) 
<br />
<br />There we go, two of the genuinely happy times for me, getting great response for things i busted my ass off and ruined my life trying to do <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> (I had 0 social life, 0 contact and 0 interaction with other humans whilst teaching. It left me with few friends as they never got so speak to me, but am catching up nicely again now<img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )</div>
