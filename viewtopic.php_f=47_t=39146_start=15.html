			<div class="content">Well, if you guys like it, then i will post the NEXT part. It will be a long one.
<br />I think.
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The Titan was a small ship compared to the huge asteroids that circled the planet of 37X290. Hmm, must have gotten tired of making up names for planets. Zekk thought. The reason that made this planet look suspicious was that these asteroids were holograms. Also, the planet seemed habitable so why wasn't it named something other than 37X290? He had been searching for days now, even weeks. Finally he had been led to this planet. A billionaire had bought it, and then he had just moved in. There weren't many billionaires that came out here to buy a planet to live on. Unexpectedly an alarm blared, and the ship rocked with an explosion. Zekk looked out the cockpit to see a couple fast moving asteroids. Not all of them were holograms. He started dodging them. Then he called for backup because he knew that this was the pirate's base. Zekk began dialing the address for Borun Karath's communication device. 
<br />                                                   *** 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Right, now Borun, this base is at the coordinates Tau-23 sector 5C. Got that? Oh, and bring your little fleet of ships. And that part you said I wanted.&#8221; Zekk finished with a sigh. He had just completed a huge battle plan with the IMC and Borun. They were going to come in with lasers blazing, engines whining with the strain, and communication on full. The IMC would send a small fleet of 20 fighters, 5 frigates, and 2 heavy cruisers. Borun would send in his fleet of fighters and he himself would bring his new ship, the Black Knight. 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Zekk, I was looking at the map you sent me, and&#8230;. I know this pirate. His name is Wesley Truman. With that, I know of his defenses&#8230;&#8221; Borun's voice was talking, but Zekk couldn't hear him, he wanted to spring up, call Borun a liar, and whack him one on the nose. It's not true! It can't be! But Borun said his name! How in the world could my father be alive? But a pirate! Wesley Truman? 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Borun, did I just hear you say Wesley Truman?&#8221; Zekk choked out.
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Yes, but what do you know about him?&#8221; 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;He's my father. You know how I told you he died?&#8221; 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;No, you didn't. Zekk, I've known Wesley for three years. He isn't your father.&#8221; 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Three years. That would be just about right. I'm 16, and that would make me 13 when my father &#8220;died&#8221;. I know! He probably deserted his squadron and became a pirate! Borun, you have to help me meet him. I have to talk to him.&#8221;
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Okay, fine. I have a cloaking device on this ship, so you and I can sneak in, cloaked, land, and shoot our way in. Great plan.&#8221;
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Thanks, let's go.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Chapter 8 
<br />	
<br />15 giant ships hung silently in outer space, 8 ships were Borun&#8217;s, and the rest of the ships were sent from the IMC. 8 frigates, and 7 heavy cruisers. Zekk sat in the Titan in command of a large fleet of fighters; everybody was ready, loaded and fully charged, waiting for the single command word that would send all the ships toward the planet of 37X290. He turned on the comm. and took a deep breath to say the command code to start the attack. 
<br />	
<br />&quot;Go.&quot; Zekk said as his ship lurched violently forward.  The attack plan was perfect, he and Borun would cloak, destroy the power generator, then land. With the generator destroyed, the heavy cruisers and frigates would come in shooting. 
<br />	
<br />Zekk could see his fleet charge ahead, and he let them, because it would cover his and Borun&#8217;s cloaking. Zekk&#8217;s red engines shot him past the slow moving frigates and heavy cruisers, then past the quicker fighters, and after that, the planet itself came closer and closer. The lush green covered most of the planet, and the dark blue oceans took over the rest. 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Okay, Borun, cover my flank.&#8221; Zekk spoke into the mike. 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;And where is that? You&#8217;re cloaked remember?&#8221; Borun said sarcastically, with a smile on his face.
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Oh, sorry. Um, just blow up the stupid generator!&#8221; Zekk was irritated at his own stupid ness, and fired his own blue photons at the circular platform that was the generator. He could see the turquoise flare of Borun&#8217;s laser and the power generator on the planet exploded in a giant fireball. &#8220;Great, now we land and find my father.&#8221;
<br />                                                           *** 
<br />	
<br />Zekk snuck down long hallway with gun in hand, followed by Borun, with a bigger gun in his hands. They had managed to get past the guards without bloodshed so far, but Zekk had a feeling that the no bloodshed would end really quickly. The door at the end of the hall opened suddenly and he aimed his gun at the opened doorway, waiting for a person or two to come through. A grenade came through instead. 
<br />	
<br />&#8220;Borun! Grenade!&#8221; Zekk yelled a warning as it continued to bounce toward him. 
<br />
