<br />
<br />Terrick landed back down in New Berlin. He realzied that he had to finish it here and now. He walked into a club and sat down.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey Hunter&quot; The bartender said &quot;what can i get ya&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Beer&quot; Terrick said &quot;your Strongest&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;yes sir!&quot; The bartender said
<br />
<br />Terrick sat there and looked at his home. It was built out of war and parties. Not much of a planet, not much of a nation. Althoughthe legedary Arion had driven back the Aliens Siruis had never fully rebuilt itself. Crime ran rampant and the police depended on hunters. It was there at that moment he realized he was the law. Funny, he though, how the people they are so dependent on Hunters when they create them in test tubes. Gentic creations is the law. So why, he wondered does he do there bidding. But Terrick didn't take saides he had no cause. he just was a man ment to kill.
<br />
<br />His beer came and he took a long chug of it. He had to kill a man who could alter pyshcail matter. What he needed was two weeks and a lab. But in New Berlin it was hard to find something like that. And worse yet the man would not let him leave. when he had tried to fly out of the docking ring he saw a blackade of 27 fighters. Now Terrick was a damn good pilot but he couldn't fight amounts like that.
<br />
<br />The door smaledopen and a familar man was there. Terrick was to drunk to notice or care. The man walked up to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;you did well, Hunter&quot; the man said
<br />
<br />&quot;Go away i dont know you.&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&quot;okay hunter i will leave this bar now, but we will end this soon&quot; The man said
<br />
<br />&quot;that&quot; Terrick said &quot;im sure of&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />Terrick was walking to a hotel when a building caught his eye. it was a lab and someone was working late. Terrick wlaked in and shot those working there. he was too drunk to think striaght. Terrick fell to the floor and before he could react he was asleep. He woke up with a killer headache, he stumbled over to a computer and inserted scans of the Restorer.  The man had a alien implant in his brain that let his mind control things at the atomic level. Terrick saw that he could make nanobots invade the system and shut it down killing the restorer.
<br />
<br />Terrick Walked down the street looking around. he could nevr be too careful. Two hunters jumped him and tried to stab him.  Terrick jumped to the ground and stabbed one in the leg. He let out a scream, clutching his leg. Terrick jumped up and stabbed him in the heart. then he turned to the other hunter, duccked and slashed him across the face.
<br />
<br />Terrick ran down the street never looking behind him. The Restorer was standing there in the middle of the road. Terrick took out the nanbots and knew that all he needed was to stab the restorer. The Restorer pulled out a knife and ran at him. He thrust it at Terrick's heart , who ducked and slashed at him. he caught Terricks knife and knocked it out of his hand and charged at Terrick. Terrick took the nanbots and stuck the needle in the mans chest.
<br />
<br />The man smiled as if he knew what was happening. then the man pulled a trigger from his pocket and squeezed.</div>
