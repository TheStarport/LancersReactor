			<div class="content">Chips started his rounds near The Download and headed up to the bakery, checking to see if the doors were locked. A couple of riders passed him, but stopped and turned their mounts. &#8220;Pardon us deputy, but which way is the livery stable&#8221; One of the men asked. &#8220;Down the street and on the right near the towns edge.&#8221; Chips pointed out. &#8220;Thank you&#8221; the man said and tipped his hat. They pulled the rains turning their horses in the direction of the livery. 
<br />										
<br />
<br />     Chips headed for the jail to check in. After checking the logs to see who was on duty, he noticed the telegram. After reading it, Chips thought back to the two men who passed him on horse back. The one who spoke, looked like the description in the telegram. He headed out to find one of the other deputies. 
<br />
<br />     Indy entered the Forum as Dr. Taw was finding his seat while glaring at Esq. Everyone knew of the rivalry between the two doctors. Most of the times, it involved these kinds of humor to each other. After asking the bartender what was going on in topics, Indy headed over to Taw and Esq&#8217;s table for a talk. About that time, wolfy and Eh_Steve entered the Forum and headed over to the youths area to find out what&#8217;s been happening. 
<br />
<br />     Boscoe decided to take a stroll around town. Not heading anywhere in particular. After a few minuets, he saw a light on in the undertakers office. After knocking several times, Orillion finally came to the door. &#8220;What can I do for you Boscoe?&#8221; he asked, gesturing him in. Boscoe noticed a body, and rather badly decayed one at that, on the work bench. &#8220;Orillion, have you been digging up old threads again&#8221; he asked with a frown on his face. 
<br />
<br />
<br />    Chips checked a couple of places, but decided to head to the Forum. Seeing Stinger standing outside the door, he whistled a low whistle getting Stingers attention. Stinger saw Chips wave him over and left his post to see what was up. &#8220;Stinger, I saw that telegram in th office about the gunslinger wanted&#8221;. &#8220;Yea, Locutus has pushed it this time, so what&#8217;s up&#8221; Stinger asked. &#8220;I was making the rounds up the street when two men rode in. One of them looked like the description in the telegram&#8221; Chips replied. &#8220;What, Locutus here?&#8221; Stinger asked incredulously. &#8220;No, not Locutus, remember I met him about 2 years ago, this was someone else&#8221; Chips answered, &#8220;Both were armed, but peaceful enough&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to find Bargib, you stay here and wait for me, Ok?&#8221; Chips nodded. 
<br />
<br />     The Forum was now in full swing. Topics going every where, with everyone weighing in on them. When the art topic got to wolfy, his reply was &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I can draw good or not&#8221;. Esq just looked at him and shook his head. Indy finally got Dr. Taw to agree to post a reply in the new editorial section for the next addition. Turning away from Taw, Indy struck out in search of another to comment on some news he had gotten earlier in the day. Arcon and Aod wondered into The Forum and headed for their usual table with a wave to some folks. 
<br />
<br />     pSYCHO, supersnipa and stormtrooper had a working holster now, but needed a different gun, something with a longer barrel. &#8220;Look&#8221;, pSYCHO said, &#8220;Hang on for a bit and I&#8221;ll go see Arania and see if I can trade guns for a different one, and be back in a few minuets&#8221;. As the door closed behind him, Stormtrooper turned to supersnipa, and asked &#8220;Did you get my message I wired two days ago?&#8221;
<br />				
<br />     By the time Stinger got back to Chips, it was getting dark. Bargib asked in a low voice, &#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s not Locutus?&#8221; Chips replied while looking around, &#8220;No doubt about it.&#8221; Then Chips thought for a moment, &#8220;It just occurred to me&#8221; a look of understanding on his face, &#8220; They were with that new Faction Gang from the other side of Dodge&#8221;. &#8220;Yes, YES, the one that was going around just killing folks for no reason&#8221; Bargib added. &#8220; Not even bothering to rob them&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;Just cold blooded killers&#8221; Stinger added, &#8220;What are we gonna do Bargib?&#8221;
<br />
<br />      Arania agreed to swap guns with pSYCHO and opened the case to find the right one. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the perfect one, The Diamondback. A little on the heavy side, but should do for you&#8221; Arania said. &#8220;Prefect, thanks Arania&#8221; pSYCHO replied and turned for the door. 
<br />
<br />
<br />     Eh_Steve piped up, &#8220;I just wanted to say, I agreed with what Dr. Esq said, after all, he was right on the flower thing we talked about the other day&#8221;. Grins spread all around. Gromit piped up, &#8220;Eh_Steve, You don&#8217;t even know what Esq was talking about&#8221; shaking his head. Recusant, tapped Gromit on the shoulder, &#8220;Ah Gromit, give him a break tonight&#8221;. 
<br />
<br />
<br />    The noise was so loud tonight in The Forum, that the sound carried out of town to the hill behind The Forum. kimk, the towns astronomer. He could always be found on the hill side looking at the stars. He could tell you any name of the constellation, planets and a lot of the stars. It was his favorite hobby. He always liked to bring that topic up at The Forum.  He always found so much to see in just looking at the stars. 
<br />
<br />
<br />     Bargib made up his mind. &#8220;Chips, head over to the Forum and see if you can find Boscoe, Mustangs out at his farm so we&#8217;re a bit short of deputies&#8221; and then added, if he&#8217;s not there, try up at the undertakers, he said he might go there, what ever fore, I have no idea&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m on my way&#8221; Chips replied and was off. &#8220;Stinger, we need to get a closer look at the stables, Do you have your horse close by?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, what do I need it for?&#8221; Stinger inquired. &#8220;Simple, give me your star and muss your hair a bit&#8221; Bargib said. &#8220;What on earth for&#8221; Stinger, clearly puzzled asked. &#8220;You have to look like a trail hand coming to town. You take your horse to the livery and board him. As you leave casually look around and report what you see back&#8221; Bargib explained. 
<br />
<br />
<br />To be Continued.
