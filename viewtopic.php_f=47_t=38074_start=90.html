<br />
<br />IC:
<br />
<br />Hahukum Konn, hidden as he was, saw two people approach; the woman, and a rather good-looking man next to her. He stepped out from under the wing, and walked around the nose of the ship to greet them. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, a Kusari man rushed up to the three of them like a man possessed, and breathlessly informed Tanya that she had a message.
<br />
<br />After that kerfluffle died down, Konn spoke. &quot;Tanya, I must apologize for obtaining information about you without your permission, so that I know your first name, but you do not know my name.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya and Travis looked at each other and regarded the blond man before them, who they could see also wore strange-looking devices on his face: Two round lenses, bridged over his nose, with frames extending back to his ears. This struck a chord of memory in Tanya, but she could not remember what they were. Also, the man's accent was mainly Libertonian, but to Tanya's practiced ear it sounded as though it had been worn smooth by some years in Bretonia. She wondered, <i>how did this guy know where my ship was? </i>
<br />
<br />Konn was continuing. &quot;My name, thus, is Hahukum Konn. As to why I am here, I confess I've gotten you, madam, into some hot water. I told some rather large Kusari goons earlier today that you had Niobium and that I was picking it up from you, so as to buy myself some time before they took my H-fuel and ship from me.
<br />
<br />&quot;I then came back here, having memorized the serial number on your visitor pass, and was able to locate your ship. Thus, my apology for my unauthorized quest for some information.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>He definitely spent some time in Bretonia </i>, Tanya thought, as she began to get irritated at the way this small-time trader had managed to get her in trouble with who knew what crime syndicate was shaking down people for their cargo in New Tokyo. She got even more irritated as she realized that this was just another unwanted event in a series of unwanted events that had just happened to her, what with Rutger's sudden let-down, the urgent message from Rob and now <i>this! </i>
<br />
<br />She yelled, &quot;Mister, I don't know who the <b><i>hell </i> </b> you think you are, but you don't have the right to involve people in the messes <b><i>you </i> </b> make and then expect them to help you clean it up!&quot; Tanya was itching to pull her concealed gun out and blast this wiseguy in the head; if she couldn't punch Rutger's face she could at least take out her anger on this freelancer.
<br />
<br />Travis got nervous when he realized both of them were armed with weapons that wouldn't register on energy scanners in major Kusari population centers. Mr. Konn probably didn't know this, and was likely unarmed. Not a fair contest...
<br />
<br />Konn had his hands held away from his body to show he was unarmed, and was speaking calmly. &quot;Madam, I can only plead desperation in light of the fact that I was likely to be roughed up and my ship and cargo stolen in any event.&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis spoke softly, so only Tanya could hear: &quot;You know, Tanya, I wouldn't shoot this guy. He <i>did </i> try to warn you instead of just taking off from here and leaving you in the soup with some nasty Kusari goons on your tail.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya was torn between physical action and logical thought. She had to admit to herself that it could have been an even more explosive situation if she had been left to fend off the criminal element in Kusari without knowing why she had to do it, and that the gentleman in the elevator had the courtesy, such as it was, to let her know he'd gotten her into his hot water.
<br />
<br />After Tanya's face worked its way from an expression of fury to a more rational appearance, Konn breathed a sigh of relief. He certainly hadn't expected to bump into a woman who was more than the ordinary tourist she seemed, and a male companion who was apparently just as involved in whatever she was doing.
<br />
<br />Tanya's voice was more rational as she spoke again: &quot;Okay. I'll trust you - for now. This is Travis Carter and I'm Tanya Williams, since we already know your name. Mr. Konn. Now, tell us exactly what you're doing here and what you told those goons you encountered.&quot;
<br />
<br />Konn replied, &quot;Thank you, sir.. ah, Travis and Tanya. I'm ex-Bretonian military, and have been a freelancer since I finished my term, doing some missions on the side as well as doing trading runs. I got word that H-fuel was cheap in Kusari, and picked up a cargo-load at Akita. I've never been in Kusari before, so I decided to tour the system a bit.
<br />
<br />&quot;I stopped here, and as soon as I left this spaceport, having registered my ship with the spaceport authorities, I noticed I was followed by these three... I hesitate to call them gentlemen, and since goons is what I've been saying, I'll call them goons. I had managed to escape them by a daredevil run across a highway near that large shopping mall complex.
<br />
<br />&quot;As I mentioned before, we briefly met in the elevator, and then the goons caught up with me. They wanted my H-fuel as well as my ship, and had apparently known of it almost as soon as I landed. I thought quickly, and told them that I not only had H-fuel, but that I was taking on a cargo of Niobium from someone else - that is, you, Tanya - and that she was to meet with me later today to put the deal through. They agreed to let me keep my ship if I let them take the 'Niobium'.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm just amazed I haven't run into those three goons again today. They must have really believed me when I said I was getting the Niobium.&quot;
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, just as Konn spoke, harsh voices bellowed from the spaceport, and three men were standing near the Bretonian Crusader, clearly very unhappy that Hahukum Konn had given them the slip. Konn turned rather pale, and he turned back to Travis and Tanya and said, &quot;I'm not armed. I left my weapon aboard ship. I'm going to need help, although I really shouldn't be asking you since I did, after all, get into this mess myself.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya had other ideas, and they involved teaching three Kusari goons a lesson about stealing peoples' cargo.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Summary: <b>Konn finally encounters Tanya, nearly gets his head blown off for his trouble, and luck runs out for him as he realizes his ship's about to be stolen anyway. </b>

			<div class="content">The three Kusari men strode purposefully towards the group standing by Tanya's falcon, but halted ten paces away when Travis put a hand up.
<br />
<br />A man slightly taller, broader and definitely uglier than his flanking counterparts addressed Tanya in guttural Common.
<br />
<br />&quot;The ignition code to your ship, your cargo, your gear and your cred-sticks. I want them all now,&quot; he demanded with a sneer. He looked Tanya up and down. &quot;And you. Get inside the cargo bay,&quot; he added.
<br />
<br />Tanya balled her fists and clenched them in absolute cold fury, her face darkened like a storm and her eyes narrowed until her green eyes were mere slits.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uh-oh. You've done it now, fella,&quot; said Travis to the Kusari, moving to the side slightly. He nodded at Konn and the freelancer swiftly joined him.
<br />
<br />Before the Kusari felon could reply, Tanya flipped back her jacket, drawn two needle guns and unloaded a deadly stream of spikes travelling at supersonic speeds towards the group of Kusari. All three fell to the floor of the hangar deck without so much as a sound, a dozen needles embedded into their foreheads.
<br />
<br />Tanya walked over to their bodies, checking them then holstered her guns satisfied all three were dead.
<br />
<br />&quot;She's efficient, isn't she?&quot; whispered Konn to the ex-bounter hunter standing beside him.
<br />
<br />Travis nodded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yep. This was a bad day to try and steal her ship, I reckon,&quot; he replied.
<br />
<br />They both continued to watch as Tanya knelt down on one knee and appeared to be inspecting the neck of the lead Kusari.
<br />
<br />&quot;Blood Dragons,&quot; she said, then looked up at the ceiling and walls of the hangar. &quot;I suppose since we're in a public place, this would have been caught on camera.&quot;
<br />
<br />She sighed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Time to go, Travis. It won't be long before the clan seek revenge.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You bet, am I driving?&quot; he asked with a smile.
<br />
<br />&quot;You kidding me?&quot; retorted Tanya. &quot;I've seen water dromedaries fly faster.&quot;
<br />
<br />The pair began boarding her Falcon, but both turned when Konn coughed from behind them.
<br />
<br />&quot;What about me?&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya and Travis looked at each other for a moment, then Tanya continued up the ladded and jumped into the cockpit without a reply.
<br />
<br />&quot;What about you?&quot; asked Travis. &quot;And don't worry about her, she's having a bad day.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well. Surely the Blood Dragons will be after me too?&quot;
<br />
<br />Travis nodded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yep. Possible.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So I'm in danger?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yep. Possible too.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya leaned down out of the cockpit.
<br />
<br />&quot;Travis, what's the fastest way to Planet Harris?&quot; she asked, just before placing her helmet on.
<br />
<br />Travis thought for a moment.
<br />
<br />&quot;Haven't been there in a while. Kyushu, Tau-29, Tau-31 I guess. Jump holes might be manned though. The BD's have good contacts these days.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I know of a couple of jump holes that might be useful,&quot; suggested Konn. &quot;I discovered them when I was serving with the Bretonian military. They're close to the trade lanes, but far enough from jump gates to avoid detection.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tanya stared at him, Konn shuffled his feet without realising.
<br />
<br />&quot;Could be a trap,&quot; whispered Travis. &quot;You hardly know this guy,&quot; said the ex-bounty hunter.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes. I remember how those work, Travis,&quot; she replied icily. Travis grunted then boarded the Falcon, manning the rear turret. &quot;Fine, Konn. You have a ship?&quot; she asked.
<br />
<br />Konn nodded, pointing to a Cavalier nearby.
<br />
<br />&quot;See you in space, let's hope your memory appears to be as good as it is.&quot;

<br />Damien picked up the message on his portable comm hidden inside his robes. He was crouched in a crawlspace on Ruiz, listening to the sounds of Outcasts walking over his head, talking in boorish, drunken voices. The hordes that stalked the station in the late hours of the night, tumbling around in cardamine and beer-fuelled hazes, had either found their way back to their own cabins or fainted on the floor of the station. The two walking above his head now passed, and silence for a moment reigned in the shipyard.
<br />
<br />He sent a message back to Hans: <i>Considering the fact that I'm stuck in a crawlspace in OMICRON BETA currently, I fail to see where that is my problem. However, I will find out and tell you if you get me out of this hellhole. Whatever you do, don't attack them. I mean that, Hans. --Damien. </i></div>

			<div class="content">&#8220;Listen Dev&#8221; Dev's friend said &#8220;Meet me in the bar on New Berlin. We need to make a plan.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Right man...&#8221; Dev grumbled, standing up. &#8220;See you there, O and O&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev tossed most of his weapons to floor, annoyed that he didn't a chance to use them. He slipped a pistol in the holster at his side and put another in his jacket. He clambered out of his ship and stumbled over into the bar.
<br />
<br />He sat down at a table, put his feet up and fell asleep. He awoke to a tap on the shoulder, a man with short green hair grinned at him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Stealing my look i see...&#8221; Dev mumbled with a grin
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look around Dev, This is New Berlin.&#8221; The man replied
<br />
<br />&#8220;Aye that it is, Dax.&#8221; He yelled swinging a beer. &#8220;Bar-tender 2 Beers now!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dax sat down and chuckled &#8220;How the hell is this happening i mean... Oh well i know it too be true.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev light a cigarette in titled his head, looking at Dax. &#8220;Explain&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look, to hell with that were a bit pressed for time so here is the Deal.&#8221; Dax Whispered looking around him &#8220;I have Quards to where the Rhienland Navy will be shipping a general, he will be on a armored transport with 2 wings of fighters. He has left new Berlin but at the pace of a armored transport and the fact that they wont be using Trade lanes we can catch up and hit them from the behind&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Cool...&#8221; Dev mumbled &#8220;What ship ya got&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sabre baby!&#8221; Dax said with a grin
<br />
<br />&#8220;Lets ride!&#8221; Dev yelled &#8220;Cya in space.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev ran over to his ship and jumped in. He flicked the ship on, then smiled and turned some music on. He shot off into space where he encountered a Sabre.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Dax... That be you right?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Me and correct grammar over here&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Isn't correct Grammar and i?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don't know... shut up Dev and follow me... and turn the bloody music off!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, Yes, No!&#8221;
<br />
<br />The two ships shot off at full speed. Dev smiled inside the cockpit of his proud Valk. He puffed on his cigarette and chuckled as he began to make out the convoy carrying the general.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alright Dax i'm popping out of formation and preparing to hit those 2 fighters from behind.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Negative, drop out hit the transport with a cruise disrupt and let the other ships overshoot. I will wait and hold them off while you go down and nab the general.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev dropped out of cruise and grinned as he shot several cruise disrupts at the transport. The hull buckled a bit then the ship stopped. Dev quickly fired upon the ship, damaging the engines and taking the shields offline.
<br />
<br />The he shot forward and landed on top of the transport. Making sure there was a sure connection between the two ships he grabbed his automatic rifle and dropped down. A guard pointed his gun at Dev.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Freeze and reach for the sky!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev chuckled and turned around &#8220;Idiot boy, there is no sky in space&#8221;
<br />The soldier looked at Dev puzzled, that was the moment Dev had been waiting for, he pointed his rifle and yelled. The guards body acted as if it was hit by a wall and staggered, blood gushing out of the many wounds. Dev ran into the next room where several other guards were. He started shooting everyone yelling and laughing. When the dust settled, every Rhienlander lay dead upon the blood soaked floor. Dev walked forward his boots making a clanging sound on the metal floor, and a gushing sound and he stepped on blood.
<br />
<br />He kicked down the next door and a stepped in. A man jumped out and knocked the gun from him and hit him in the face. Dev got pissed off, and that wasn't good at all. He grabbed the man in a head locked and pulled out his knife.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now you son of a... This is where you die!&#8221; Dev said  as he held the knife up to the mans face. He shoved it in the mans eye, then pulled it out and shoved it in the other eye. When Dev was satisfied the man would bleed to death he dropped the man to the floor.
<br />
<br />Dev grabbed a pistol from his holster at his side and walked into the next room, shooting two men in in the head before they could move. Then he turned to what appeared to be a officer. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;General, it is time.&#8221;
<br />
<br />                                                      ***         
<br />Dax saw the incoming fighters and gritted his teeth. He shot forward and launched a volley of missiles at the nearest one. They smashed into the hull exploding the ship. Dax smiled coldly and pulled up as another ship shot several volleys of laser weapons at him.  He neared in 3 meters on one ship and fired two torpedos. Pulling up away from the blast Dax started carpet bombing the area of space with the other fighters.
<br />
<br />One of the fighters pulled up at him and fired several missiles. Dax's ship buckled and his faced smacked the controls, blood dripping everywhere.
<br />
<br />                                                      ***        
<br />
<br />Dev grabbed a pistol from the floor that one of the guards had, he set it to stun and shot the Officer several times. Then he dragged the man all the way to where the connection between his ship and the Transport was. He climbed into it and threw the officer in a crate and locked it.
<br />
<br />Dev looked at his radar and swore. &#8220;Oh hell...&#8221; 
<br />
<br />His ship pulled off the transport and he dropped several  mines on the transport, exploding it into pieces.  Then he turned the the other fighters, he counted 4. And cursed. He flew up above them and dropped all his  mines down on them. They locked on and shot after the Rhienlander ships. Dev saw two of them explode and the rest be damaged. Feeling merciful he just shot off. Leaving Dax's ship sitting there as the Rhienlanders closed in....

			<h3><a href="#p360786" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Hahukum Konn paused to breathe a huge sigh and take stock as he powered up his ship. <i>From freelance trader to wanted individual in about twenty seconds. This must be some kind of record  </i>, he thought. <i>It's also not every day a woman your age can make you feel like you're ten years old again and being scolded for taking cookies without asking  </i>, he mentally added. He then rapidly went through the preflight check and confirmed that all was OK.
<br />
<br />Luckily, both Konn and Tanya were able to get clearance to leave without anybody being the wiser, and zoomed off their landing pads as quickly as possible. Once in space above New Tokyo, he opened a secure channel to Tanya's Falcon and  ransmitted the code-clearance sequence.
<br />
<br /><b>Secure channel confirmed and opened </b>, his neural net prodded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Crusader calling Falcon. Do you read me five by five?&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;We read you five by five over here. What's the game plan?&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;I know only the relative location of Kyushu from here. You know the jump holes going from here to the Tau systems. I occasionally patrolled inside the Tau systems due to BMM's mining operations, so I know how to make our way through once we 
<br />leave Kusari space.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Right. I'll upload waypoints that go as far as the entry to Tau-23 through Kyushu. After that, I'm leaving it up to you to get us safely into Tau-31. We have to go to Holman Outpost.&quot;  </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger. Wilco.&quot; Before Konn could engage cruise flight, Tanya spoke again.
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;I have a question. What are those things you wear in front of your eyes? I've been trying to remember and it isn't coming to me.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;They're my corrective lenses. The old term was 'eyeglasses'. My eyesight isn't <b>that </b> bad, though; they serve a covert function as well. The lenses, under the influence of a small electric field, will distort in a known fashion and can thus zoom in on whatever I look at. I had them on earlier to spy on the control booth at the spaceport. When I want to leave them at their normal setting, the electric field vanishes, and so does the distortion. The power usage is minimal, and the batteries are stored along the frames that go to my ears.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Cool,&quot; </i> Travis said.
<br />
<br />Konn's neural net informed him about thirty seconds later that a series of waypoints had been uploaded, and he saw that the first ended in the middle of an asteroid field called the Kanto Field.
<br />
<br />Tanya's voice broke in on his preparations to go to cruise speed. <i>&quot;By the way, you realize if you mess up or you're playing us for suckers, I'll have no problem destroying your ship and leaving your escape pod to the tender mercies of the Outcasts or the Blood Dragons, whoever gets to you first.  </i>
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;I'm not completely incapable of finding my way around the Tau systems; it'll just take about three times as long and make me about ten times more frustrated searching for your miracle jump holes.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;Fully understood. Commencing to go to cruise velocity, now.&quot; At that, Konn engaged his cruise engines and set the autopilot to aim for the first waypoint.
<br />
<br />Their luck held all the way through Kusari space, as they emerged in the Hayate Dust Field without incident, and flew galactic south and west in clear Kyushu space with little extraneous space traffic to notice them. They crossed high above the trade lane to the Tau 29 jump gate, and swiftly reached the next waypoint, the Tau 23 jump hole in the Ohka Dust Field.
<br />
<br />Hahukum opened the secure channel again and said, &quot;Crusader to Falcon. All right; from this point on I have navmaps of the Tau systems either from, as I said, direct patrol or from my own travels to and from Tau-37. Your neural net will be informed of the waypoints I upload in a few seconds.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Roger. Standing by.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />Konn quickly worked out from his nav maps which jump holes to use, feeding in a path that led from the Kyushu jump hole in Tau-23 to the Tau-29 jump hole, which would then put them into the Oxygen Field in Tau-29. Their final jump hole would be in the Samura Ice Asteroid Field, going to Tau-31.
<br />
<br />He sent off the series of waypoints to Tanya, and shortly after, he heard her response.
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Confirmed, Crusader. This mess of waypoints is unbelievable. The good part is how we get to go to Tau-29 without needing a jump gate. Let's go.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />&quot;One thing. We'll be passing near the Cali Base when we go through this jump hole. I'm on the outs with the Outcasts since this is the same ship I had in the Bretonian Armed Forces, and they'll know it by the signature it transmits. I don't know about you two, though.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;We'll just have to run the risk, then, won't we?&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />Hahukum could almost see an ironic smirk on Tanya's face in his mind's eye. With that, he initiated the dock sequence with the jump hole and delivered himself into the hands of fate. Everyone knew the Outcasts could be ruthless when they wanted to be, and he had no desire to replay the battles he'd fought once upon a time.
<br />
<br />Tanya followed, and crossed her fingers...
<br />
<br />OOC: Cliffhanger. DOn't worry, I'll follow up real quick. This is just the first of a two-parter, although normally I wouldn't do something like this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Summary: <b>Hahukum Konn, Tanya Wiliams, and Travis Carter just finished making a date with the administration of summary justice to some goons, and so needed to disappear. They've prepped to move through the maze of Tau systems.  </b>

			<div class="content">Hahukum Konn didn't realize he'd been holding his breath until he saw that his contact list was empty, except for the Falcon. He took a brief moment to marvel at the contrast between the medium blues of Kusari and the dark blue, almost inky blackness of Tau-23, except for the sickly green sun off to the right in his viewport. <i>That was a lucky break. I've lost track of how many times those sods would be gathered round a jump hole to get the drop on anyone coming through, </i> he reflected.

<br />Konn activated the secure channel, and spoke. &quot;Crusader to Falcon. Please enter formation.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Entering formation now.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />He wasted no time after that in engaging cruise engines and autopilot for the next waypoint, the jump hole to Tau-29. Their ships moved swiftly through the asteroid field, with their thrusters aimed to &quot;push&quot; them slightly to their left to edge away from Cali Base.
<br />
<br />Their luck held until the waypoint distance meter read &quot;21 K&quot;, and three Outcast ships showed up in red on the contact list dead ahead of them.
<br />
<br />Konn spoke: &quot;Break formation, and we'll fight as soon as fired upon, so we know their range.&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;Just stay alive, mister. We've been through a few of these ourselves.&quot; </i>
<br />
<br />Hahukum left his ship in cruise until the first blast hit his ship. At that point, he cut cruise mode, and aimed towards one of the Outcast ships heading towards him, while using his side thrusters to move slightly left or right to keep the other ship from getting a good aim. He kept the firing cursor aimed at the Outcast ship while blasting away with all six of his weapons. The blue shield gauge on his ship still dropped precipitously as the Outcast's own bolts occasionally landed, but he was rewarded with the the blue shield status on the opposing ship having dropped about 10 percent.
<br />
<br />As soon as his ship passed the Outcast, he cut thrusters back on and zoomed after the other guy, both of them weaving and jinking through a cluster of asteroids trying to avoid each others' shots while getting off a direct hit of their own. When Konn's shields came back up to almost full, he decided to try and pour it on in a straight run at the other ship, a Stiletto, which he knew to be roughly comparable to his own in weapons loadout.
<br />
<br />Konn saw the other ship just beginning to turn around for a run back at him, and decided to go for it. He put thrusters on full, and as he did so he held down the firing button, gripping the controls as he aimed steadily at the Outcast ship, pouring energy against the other's shields. He was rewarded when, just as his own shields were about to quit, the HUD showed the other's shields to be completely gone. He instantly hit the shields-restore button, and whipped back 'round to press home his attack.
<br />
<br />Konn was able, with some dexterity, to inflict about 25% damage to the other ship's hull before he saw the blue shield-status come back on for the opposing ship. He cursed and his focus lifted for a second as he saw a fireball momentarily light up an asteroid just below him. The contact list still showed the Falcon, so he knew that Tanya and Travis had not been the unfortunate victim.
<br />
<br />The answer to that very suddenly easy victory came when he got closer to the sun, having decided to get out of the arena of battle for a second to let his ship's shields restore, and all of a sudden the &quot;Danger: Radiation Damage&quot; voice came on.
<br />
<br /><i><b>&quot;BUGGER!&quot; </i> </b> yelled Konn as he hit nanobots, shield restore, and thrusters all at once. He realized what had happened. The Outcast who'd gotten blown up must have incautiously flown into the radiation zone, hoping to lead the Falcon into it, but then forgotten to activate his nanobots, leaving his hull and weapons in a permanently weakened condition.
<br />
<br />He decided the best way to finish this off would be to double-team the Outcast fighting Tanya and Travis. He soared up from below, weapons firing at the Stiletto which was trying to fire at both of them at the same time. Konn cut engines again, sailed past the Outcast which jinked off behind an asteroid, Tanya following. He went over the asteroid, and took a couple of pot-shots at the Outcast as it cut thrusters back in and zoomed away before further damage could be inflicted on it.
<br />
<br />He followed, as did Tanya, and both blasted away at the ship as its pilot tried a lunging run at them, apparently hoping to blow one or the other of them up before he was done in, but the Stiletto's shields failed too quickly under the combined onslaught, and when the distance meter read &quot;100&quot;, a well-placed missile from the Falcon caused a brilliant pyrotechnic display as the ship disintegrated.
<br />
<br />The final battle with the last Outcast ended much the same way, although not without a &quot;shields failed&quot; warning on Konn's ship a couple of times and some dicey maneuvering around the asteroids to avoid wasting too many shield-restoration batteries.
<br />
<br />After the last Stiletto disintegrated, there was some discussion about the loot, and as the Crusader still had all the H-fuel in it, Tanya took the various cargos that had been dumped by the ships after their explosions, and Hahukum took whatever weapons were floating around. He wiped his brow, and resumed course for the waypoint to the Tau-29 jump hole.
<br />
<br /><i>Not bad for a rusty ex-BAF guy, </i> Konn thought. This had been one of the longest battles he'd fought since he'd left the BAF. Freelancing, for him, amounted to getting the best value for the least amount of trouble, and so if the odds didn't favor him, he'd just dump half his cargo and watch the vultures start trading shots with each other for the right to get around 5000 credits' worth of free Niobium, or Diamonds. He had been pleased that his fighting instincts hadn't left him, though, and that his technique would probably still pass muster with his commanding officer.
<br />
<br />The rest of the journey was almost anti-climactic, with the only nasty part being the Oxygen gas pockets in Tau-29 that they had to watch out for; Tanya and Travis had a bad scare when a gas explosion nearly took out all of their shields, but otherwise their luck held out all the way to Holman Outpost.
<br />
<br />Hahukum initiated the dock sequence first, and said over the secure channel, &quot;I'll see you guys at the bar, I guess?&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>&quot;You certainly will,&quot; </i> chuckled Travis.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Summary: <b>Space battle, victory to our side. Baaaaaaaaad Outcasts! They land on Holman, and wait to see what comes next. </b>

<br />
<br />Jake Edwards, under the alias he had been forced to use for the past three years, Jake Talon, walked into the spaceport bar on Planet Manhattan.  
<br />
<br />He entered the bar, which he had visited frequently for the past several years.  It was so different than it had been when he had been to it with his buddies John Mason and Gary Middlemist when he had been at West Point.  
<br />
<br />Back then, the bar had been bright and clean, with lots of well-to-do people in it.  Now, it had degraded far below the standards one would expect from the main spaceport bar of a house capital planet.
<br />
<br />The bright colors had been replaced by varying shades of black and gray.  The happy, cheerful bartender with his black whiskers had been fired, for a dull man who rarely even moved, and made terrible Liberty Ales.  
<br />
<br />But Liberty Ale was not why he was here.  He was here to meet his old friends.  Not Mason and Middlemist, but other friends.  He walked to the usual table, in the back of the bar.  He, as well as his friends, feared the spies of Mason, for he had them everywhere.  
<br />
<br />Two dark figures were sitting on the corner of the small, dark table.  One was a tall, blond male, the other was a shorter female with dark hair.  Edison Trent and Juni Zane.
<br />
<br />They were both Colonels in the Order, as well as high-ranking officials in the LSF.  They were good friends of his, and he had often saved them or their reputations while they were busy messing things up.  Lately they had been quiet, and Jake had wondered where they had been while rumors of the Nomads had been afoot.  Jake had recieved some insider information, and he had learned that Mason was behind the Nomad attack.  He had no idea how or why, but he knew that he had to find out some more.
<br />
<br />He took a seat across from the two.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Welcome back, Jake,&quot; Juni said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Glad to be here,&quot; Jake replied.
<br />
<br />&quot;We are glad you showed up.  We are getting nervous, since Orillion hasn't contacted us in a while.  I presume you heard about the Nomad return in Sigma-19?&quot; Trent said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.  I heard much, but I know there have been many rumors floating around as well, so I am not sure what to believe.  I am fairly convinced that the Nomads were involved, and that my old friend John Mason had something to do with the whole deal.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we have many contacts, as you know well enough, and we managed to aquire some valuable information on this.  We do know that Mason was involved, and he was actually the mastermind of this scheme.  We also know that it was Nomads that were in Sigma-19.  The houses were tricked by Mason, who had the Nomads cloaked in the system.  We still have no idea how Mason got the Nomads to cooperate with him, but we know that he is an agent for some other power, and he has been that way for nearly a decade,&quot; Juni said.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, what do we do?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I will go and find Orillion, which could take weeks.  Trent will go back to the Dyson Sphere and go check on the Order forces there, and help make sure no more Nomads are allowed to enter Sirius.  You need to go find more information on this, particularly on Sigma-19.  We have two people that you need to meet.  Find them, speak to them, and stick with them for a while,&quot; Juni said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Who are they?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;One is a girl that I met when I was in Sigma-19, over a week ago.  Her name was Eve.  I had left before the incident, unfortunatly.  But I have reason to believe that she was in Sigma-19 during the incident, and from what I had seen of her, I feel that she was right in the thick of things,&quot; Trent said.
<br />
<br />&quot;The other is our old friend, Rob Schaefer.  Yes, I know you have heard of him.  He has given the LSF a lot of trouble in the past, and he was on our wanted list for a while.  That was way back when you were still in West Point, though, right after the Nomad Incursions.  Anyways, he was also in-system during the battle, and we think he may be persuaded to cooperate.  He seems to have gone soft after his wild younger days.  I think that he can be trusted,&quot; said Juni.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good, is there anything else?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nothing other than our promise to contact you once we have reached Orillion.  Good luck, Mr. Edwards.  Everything else is on your neural net&quot;
<br />
<br />Trent and Juni got up and left the bar.  Jake remained seated for a moment, considering their words.  
<br />
<br />Damn, it was good to be back in business.  
<br />
<br />He left the bar, and headed to Hanger 7B, which was where his ship was.  His ship was one of the finest in Liberty.  It had the look of a normal Liberty Defender, but on the inside, it was far more.  It had triple plated niobium/titanium armor, a high class shield, and top-of-the-line weapons.  
<br />
<br />He hopped in, and jetted off into the skies of Manhattan, in search of a girl named Eve and a man named Rob.</div>

<br />
<br />Dev Gritted his teeth as he shot off. He had to do something he wasn't to fond of doing, leaving a friend for dead... or worse. He sighed and light another cigarette 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Just cant stop with these&#8221; He said holding the cigarette up to his face &#8220;Luckily for spacers cancer isn't a concern.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev guided his ship into the center of the Ruhrfeld Asteroid Belt. And cut the engines. With a smile  he put his feet up on computer panel of his ship. He was drifting off to sleep when he heard a clang from his cargo hold.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bout time...&#8221; Dev muttered as got up and dragged himself over to his hold. The Rhienlander General who had been rudely tossed in a crate was making a fuss. Dev grabbed the General and hoisted the man to his feet. Dev looked at the general for a few minutes then took his cigarette and pushed it into the mans eye. The general grabbed his eye and started screaming. Thats when Dev Hoofed the man in the nuts with his steel tipped boots, without saying a word. The general fell the the ground gasping for air and Dev just gave a little chuckle. 
<br />
<br />He knelt  next to the general and pulled out a knife, he fiddled with it for a moment then looked at the general and smiled. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Now General, i believe we have a matter to discuss.&#8221; Dev said grinning, holding back laughter.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I will not tell you anything scum, for the glory of Rhienland!&#8221; The General spat at Dev.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh... my dear general you are mistaken. You will tell my everything or you will die quite horribly. But i have been rude now haven't allow me to introduce myself, Dev. Odd name i know. See i was a zoner growing up and well i was raised by my older sister who isn't quite the run of the mill person... But i digress, so General start telling me about this attack on Bretonia. &#8220; Dev said, twirling the knife within his hand.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Never!&#8221; The General yelled. Dev raised his knife and smashed it down, but a one forth of a inch next to the Generals neck &#8220;Next time&#8221; Dev whispered &#8220;Its your ear&#8221; 
<br />
<br />Dev let go of the knife, still embedded in the floor and started playing with his lighter.  &#8220;Start talking... It would not be a good idea to anger me, General. Your stars on your shoulder cant save you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alright you son of a B*tch!&#8221; The General Spat at him &#8220;In Two weeks Time the glory of Rhienland will be felt by everyone as we march to victory! We will attack Bretonia for they breed distrust against are true leader.  And we will cull anyone who does stand before us and we will raise the Rhienlander flag above New London Palace.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Good good&#8221; Dev mumbled &#8220;Now tell me what the attack force will consist of and where it will launch.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Never!&#8221; The General said coldly. Dev Sighed and took his lighter and held the flame close the the generals unhurt eye. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Talk&#8221; Dev said slowly
<br />
<br />&#8220;You wouldn't Dare!&#8221; The general replied
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don't try me&#8221; Dev said with a smirk.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Alright Aright&#8221; The General Gasped. &#8220;We hope to have 3 battleships 2 wings of gunboats and 4 wings of fighters attacking. They will leave Our capital planet in 2 weeks time!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev smiled &#8220;Good Job General&#8221; Then Dev stood up and pointed his pistol at the Generals head.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Blood for blood&#8221; Dev muttered as he slowly pulled the trigger.'
<br />
<br />With a sigh he sat down in his cockpit and typed up a short message. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Tanya Some nasty stuff is down, the file sent has some juicy info. This channel is secure, and wont be tapped. In the mean time i am going to take some Bounties and keep a low profile. If you need some extra muscle or a underworld man. You know i am willing too, free considering the scale of events.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev sent the message and leaned back, with a sigh he pulled forward and brought up a menu of bounties. 
<br />
<br />Amy Ferngate 10 mill.
<br />Jason whiler 30,000
<br />Bob Thompson 25,00
<br />
<br />The list went on but the top name caught Dev's eye. He opened the file and leaned back. 
<br />
<br />He found the girl's email and typed a message.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Big things are going down, you don't know me but we must meet. Contact me ASAP&#8221;
<br />
<br />Dev smirked and turned the ship around and shot off into the stars.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />OOC: Just to point out, Dev has sorta Two sides. One is Energetic happy and blood thirsty. Another sad depressed and quiet.</div>

<br />
<br />Rheinland Military captain Dieter Weber stood in the bridge of the cruiser RNC Hamburg  and watched as his ship, escorted by a flight of four Valkyries, entered the trade lane outside the Freistadt base, belonging to Daumann Heavy Construction. Behind his ship was the Daumann large transport Wilhelmshaven , carrying a cargo of new prototype weapons developed and manufactured at Freistadt, and now underway to Rheinland for testing by the Military. The command crew members were busily performing their duties in the bridge, and Weber sat down in the captain's chair, watching as his ship moved rapidly forwards inside the trade lane.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, about halfway between Freistadt and Stuttgart jumpgate near the trade lane, four Titan VHF's were waiting inside the Walker nebula. They were using minimal power, with only scanners, comms, life support and shields (to keep rocks and asteroids from damaging the ships) turned on.
<br />
<br />&quot;The convoy has left Freistadt. They'll arrive on your position soon&quot; a clearly nervous voice said to Juan via his radio in a Rheinlandic accent.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good. Once i'm done i'll tell my men to let your sister go...and remember, you know what happens if you talk.&quot; Juan replied with a cold, yet satisfied voice. 
<br />
<br />&quot;O...okay&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It was a pleasure doing business with you.&quot; Juan said and closed the channel. He selected a new channel, and said:&quot;Is everything ready.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes sir&quot; a hispanic voice replied. &quot;The freighter is in position, and the transmitter and charges are ready.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Excellent.&quot;
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, RNC Hamburg was approaching the Corsairs' position on the trade lane. Captain Weber was getting concerned. They were now in the middle of the Walker nebula, and Weber knew that any possible attack would happen here.
<br />&quot;So far so good...&quot; ship's XO, commander Kurt Dietrich said from behind Weber and his chair. Suddenly one of the communications operators, an NCO in his mid-20's turned to Weber and shouted:&quot;Sir, we're receiving a distress signal!&quot;
<br />
<br />The shout pulled Weber out of his thoughts, and he looked at the man and said:&quot;Put it on speakers.&quot;
<br />
<br />The NCO pressed some buttons at his console, and soon the voice of a tired Bretonian man, interfered by static background noises of fire, carried from the speakers:&quot;To all ships in the vicinity...this is Bowex freighter Sigma...19...we need immediate assistance....attacked...pirates...disabled...ship..took cargo...please...send help&quot; the rest of the message could not be heard, and was covered under static and interference.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn it! Oh i knew something like this would happen....well, we can't just leave them there. Liutenant, leave the trade lane!&quot; Weber said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes sir!&quot; ship's helmsman replied, and soon the cruiser exited the tradelane, and the transport and fighters in a formation pattern followed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Comms, did you get a fix on the signal's location?&quot; commander Dietrich asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes sir...600 meters away, bearing 3-3-1!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir, we have a cargo to protect.&quot; Dietrich said and looked at his CO. &quot;This could be a trap.&quot;
<br />
<br />Weber thought for a moment, and then said:&quot;Damn...well, we can't just leave them there. Well, they're not that far from here. Divert the course to 3-3-1.&quot;
<br />
<br />Satisfaction was visible in Juan's face as he looked at his scanners and saw several ships approaching the freighter. Two large ones, and several smaller ships. Juan reminded himself that his job was not over yet. In fact, it had just begun.
<br />
<br />The Rheinland convoy had diverted from course, and was now near the freighter. The ships had stopped and captain Weber looked at the freighter few hundred meters away with a concerned and serious look on his face. &quot;Sir, i can't get any readings from the freighter. Probably caused by damages and fuel leaks.&quot; said the sensors officer.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alright, let's have a look.&quot; commander Dietrich said and took a comms device connected to ship's own communications systems. &quot;Escorts Bravo Three and Four, break formation and investigate the freighter.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Copy that Hamburg&quot; the voice of one of the Valkyrie pilots carried from the loudspeakers. The worried and serious bridge crew looked as the two Valkyrie fighters exited the formation and headed towards the freighter. Soon the fighters stopped, and the first fighter did careful maneuvers around the freighter using his thrusters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Strange...i can't get any lifesigns from the ship. Wait...what the hell? I'm detecting increasing energy readings....&quot; the pilot of the Valkyrie closest to the freighter shouted, but didn't finish his sentence before the freighter exploded into a bright fireball, destroying the both Valkyries near it.
<br />
<br />&quot;What the hell...&quot; shocked Weber stared at the fireball, and only couple of seconds after the explosion, his sensors officer shouted almost in panic:&quot;Incoming ships! I got two...no, four inbound contacts bearing 2-8-4 and closing in fast!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's move in boys!&quot; Juan shouted and powered up his systems. Other Titans followed and assumed a line formation with Juan. Soon they exited the cloud into a clearing near the trade lane, and saw ahead the cruiser, transport and their two fighter escorts.
<br />&quot;Unidentified ships, this is RNC Hamburg. Cut your engines and stand down&quot; the voice of captain Weber carried from Juan's earphones. The convoy was still in a formation, and was now heading towards the jumpgate. Juan looked at his HUD, the ships were almost on firing range. Juan heard another message by Weber from his comms. Weber was getting more nervous:&quot;This is the last warning! Cut your engines or we will...!&quot; he ordered, but his message was covered under Juan's wild battle cry:&quot;Death to Rheinland scum! Open fire!&quot;
<br />
<br />As Juan pulled the trigger in his ship's joystick, the ship's torpedo launcher fired two Sunslayers at the RNC Hamburg. Meanwhile, his wingmen also opened fire, and a salvo of eight Sunslayer torpedoes flew towards the cruiser.
<br />&quot;Incoming torpedoes! Evasive maneuvers, fighters break and attack!&quot; captain Weber shouted in panic over the comms. Juan smiled as he heard Weber's panicked shouts and saw eight Sunslayer torpedoes hit Hamburg's  hull. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Break and engage the escorts!&quot; Juan shouted as he banked right to evade the Hamburg  and the explosions that were tearing it's hull apart. Juan and another Corsair concentrated their fire on one of the Valkyries, and it's shields soon collapsed under concentrated fire by two Titans. Juan fired the final cannon salvo, and the fighter exploded into a fireball, with components flying everywhere. He could see on the left corner of his field of vision that the second Valkyrie had been taken care of, and the cruiser's hull had broken into two parts, with explosions tearing them apart. Now the transport was unprotected, and now came the last phase of the attack.
<br />
<br />&quot;Daumann freighter, jettison your cargo at once or you will be destroyed.&quot; Juan said over comms to the freighter as his flight assumed positions surrounding the freighter. Even though the transport had guns, it's captain knew well that the freighter was no match to four Corsair Titans. 
<br />
<br />The freighter captain sighed deep, and replied:&quot;Understood&quot;. Juan could sense the powerless anger in the captain's voice. He watched as the cargo crates were ejected and soon floated in space near the freighter. The Corsair ship tractored everything they could inside, and when they were ready Juan opened the comms again:&quot;Daumann freighter, thank you for your co-operation. Now gentlemen, leave no witnesses&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, what is this? You son of a *****! the transport captain shouted as the Titans opened fire at it. Soon the transport exploded in a bright fireball, taking any remaining cargo with it.
<br />&quot;Gentlemen, today's work is done. Let's head back to Crete. The Elders will be very pleased&quot;. Juan said with a satisfied smile on his face and turned his ship back into the Walker Nebula. As his wingmen followed and they assumed a line formation while underway to a jumphole, Juan continued:&quot;The recent events may have damaged us badly, but we are not beaten. This strike will send everyone a message, that the Corsairs are not gone. Once again we shall rise from the ashes, and once again shall the entire Sirius, from Rheinland to Kusari, fear the name of the Corsairs.&quot;
<br />
<br />Summary:Juan and his men attack a Rheinland convoy carrying prototype rifles for Rheinland military, destroy the transport and cruiser and fighters escorting it and take the rifles.

			<div class="content">Ok, finally writing an update...
<br />
<br />IC:
<br />Damien crept through the crawlspace, stomach growling in pain. Five days since he had eaten. Not that he had really noticed the passing of the time...
<br />
<br />He edged through the crawlspace, hair falling matted and tangled in front of his face and across his chest, robes torn, face gaunt and pale, eyes sunken. Outcasts tramped over his head in drunken voices--<i>God are those idiots never sober!?! </i>--as slunk through shadows, his eyes burning with determination. Light burned up ahead, the light spreading out from the docking bays. Hope, or something like it, was lit inside his chest.
<br />
<br />No, not hope. Hope that he would live to see his beloved again had died with his failure to kill Tanya. There was only the sick, raw determination, the burning bloodthirst deep within his chest, the sick, pure hatred that was a fire in his breast and pushed for his every movement. 
<br />
<br />Damien edged ever farther along the tunnel, towards the light. At the end, he found a gate, a thin lining of metal mesh that blocked him from that path towards destiny that lay in the light. Outside, through the mesh, he could see only two Outcasts standing by an unmanned Sabre. The bloood of these two would rain first upon the fields of the dead. Flinging his foot out, the mest flung open as he somersaulted out of the crawlspace that had housed him for a week, pulling out thin, long blaster as he tumbled to the ground, landing on his feet and shooting within a milisecond the two who stood before him. He spat on their carcasses.
<br />
<br />Looking down, he saw that the two had been watching over a man inside a vac-suit. He frowned, wondering who the prisoner was.
<br />
<br />&quot;You suffered at the hands of the Outcasts, too, friend?&quot; He said as he dragged it into the cargo hold of the Sabre.
<br />
<br />He turned off the autopilot and crashed through the doors of the station, triggering nearly every alarm possible. Soaring out of Ruiz, he headed his ship and cargo towards Omicron Alpha. Revenge would be his, bloodthirsty, cold hearted revenge.</div>
