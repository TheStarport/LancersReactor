			<div class="content">I agree with limiting new techs, and only did what I did to be able to actually compete with rhineland and liberty when  get a fleet built.
<br />
<br />However, I'd suggest a few changes to what you guys have suggested.
<br />
<br />For every research station, maybe .1 of a research material type per turn.
<br />
<br />Also, no superweapons, like rhineland's bio-weapon. EVER house would turn on something like that.
<br />
<br />Also, having the amount of ships you build deterimite on how many shipyard docking bays you have (FIghter and cap)
<br />
<br />For instance, if you have 4 docking bays on a shipyard, you could build 4 battleships over the course of a week.
<br />
<br />Or, you could combine the resources of the bays to complete a bb in about 3 to 3 and 1/2 days.
<br />
<br />Or, for a fighter shipyard, say have 10 fighter construction bays. That way, you could use 2 bays apiece for VHFs, a bay and a half for a HF, and 1 bay for LF's and 3 for frieghters and bombers.
<br />
<br />Each fighter would take 2 days to complete.
<br />
<br />Also, new technologies would need to be approved by the rpg administrator before starting research.
<br />
<br />Also, another thing. No uber ships like rhineland's ships.
<br />Keep in mind how much power you'd have to draw for every system. The normal fusion reactors of freelancer even the battleship ones wouldn't be able to support the firepower. Plus, you'd have to research tech for the shields, as the battleships in the game didn't have them. And don't give me that &quot;super fuel&quot; crap. I hate the way you use it as an excuse to make the ultimate brute power. Actually have some strategy, like hit and runs, ambushes, things like that instead of just brute force. Thing about how manuvering can play a role in the course of a battle.
<br />
<br />Plus, don't forget about things like lighter ships. Those can be just as deadly and problematic for the bigger ships as other BBs can be.
<br />
<br />Also, a slight cap on finding systems. I recommend having what you'd like to see in the system approved by the rpg admin, and only being able to find one new system a month instead of finding one every day or so, like I am forced to do, and I still won't be able to face rhineland. I would like to recommend that you scrap most of the fleets so that this rpg is more realistic. 
<br />
<br />Amd give factions that have no base and no chances of surving a system at the outset. *I belive we should base the next rpg on a mod.*

			<div class="content">It seems with the new promethius in operation, the war has basicly ended. The lrf has ended all raids against war supplies, and is trying to become a branch of the liberty navy, the fast strike and exploration division, if not a full time exploratory faction.
<br />
<br />And as we are being totally civil, and even allowing liberty access to New america, we are going to ask to come to the conference to discuss hispania's future in the wake of this dangerous, dangerous weapon. 
<br />
<br />I tried to end the war, promethius suceeded.
<br />
<br />And since liberty rebelled, we have no quarrel against them anymore, and will be supplying our AM reducer coil tech and re-router tech to them. The envelope drive we will keep as a trade secret of the soon to be explorers. They can look at our Marcs and Antimatter torpedos and our mirage torpedo tubes though. Spectral shielding we'll probably also keep to ourselves.

			<div class="content">I not so sure about this...
<br />You guys are getting a little strict on these rules.  I dislike the whole 'turn building' idea thing, in that it is too strict, and that people like the Rogues can be equal to Rheinland, or any other house.  On the current one, the vets were kinda mad because they had been playing, and building up for a long time, and then these new players came in and messed with everything they had made by literally building large forces in a short time, and then becoming as powerful as the vets overnight, then changing the story.  
<br />My favorite pastime is not video games, or computer games, but actually strategy board games.  I play them a ton with my friends, and I think this RPG is actually quite similar to those games.  I can easily write up a large set of rules for this, if you guys want.  Many of your ideas are good, but I dislike some of them, because they make the game slower, and less interesting.  I want the game to be fast paced, and interesting, even if it means sacrificing a bit of realism.
<br />A few ideas:
<br />Start the game by having everyone chose factions.
<br />Each faction has it's own special set of strengths and weaknesses.  Maybe 4str. 3 weak. for houses, 3str. 3weak. for major factions,(large corps, BHG, Corsairs, Outcasts, Junkers, IMG, etc.)  2str. 2 weak for minor factions. (Small pirates, small corps)  Examples of strengths and weaknesses:
<br />Hidden Base  (No one can attack this one base)
<br />Better of One Type of Ship
<br />Worse of One Type of Ship
<br />Mined System  (Only fighters can enter one system)
<br />Extra Money
<br />Less Money
<br />So On... 
<br />Then each faction would get a start amount of ships, about as they are in the FL universe.  Then, a certain amount of credits to add to that amount.  Use credits to buy ships, hire soldiers, build bases, and on the first round, it would all be instantly build wherever you wanted.  The game would then officially start, with  each faction allowed one buiding turn a day, but an unlimited amount of moving, diplomacy, etc.  Each faction would have a certain 'fixed' amount of credits per turn, and it could be increased several ways.
<br />Commodity mining and trade-
<br />Certain systems on the map would have 'commodities' on them.  Each commodity would be worth a certain amount in certain places, based on the real FL universe.  If you entered a trade agreement with another faction, then you could trade a commodity to them for a certain 'price per unit' as in FL, and you would get that money to build.  You could buy frieghters, which would increase the amount of goods that you can send to another faction.
<br />
<br />Whoa, I'm worn out, but tell me what you think, and I'll write up a better set this week.  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I still think the turn building idea is something we should implement. I think jacob said something was wrong with it... &quot;groups like the rogues can be equal to Rheinland&quot; or something to that effect.
<br />
<br />The whole POINT of the turn system is to prevent stuff like that.
<br />
<br />It's to ensure that the game moves as a reasonable pace that actually makes sense. This way, we'll be able to know whether the guy amassing a huge navy can actually do that in the time frame he's claiming that he can.
<br />
<br />I have another proposal I'd like to make, a variation to the main theme of the rp.
<br />
<br />Instead of having each player control a faction, what if we erase the faction loyalties, and give each player control of a planet. The idea would be to have something like post-Napoleonic Europe, where there are all these little countries building up empires and making shaky alliances and, occasionally, declaring war. This way, everyone would have the opportunity to play as a country, as opposed to only four members getting that distinction.</div>

			<div class="content">While that may be a good idea Arilias it does sort of take the RPG out of its Freelancer context. I don't think we could even take the RPG back in time becasue the Houses existed from the get-go. Personally, if I got involved I wouldn't <i>want </i> to be a House. I'd much prefer to me a more flexible organization than a great big behemoth.

			<div class="content">Ok, lets say Corsairs/Outcasts are allowed, but VHFs are still banned (to balance everything out). Ok, as somebody said (was either richard or jacob) we need a budget. The best way to do this would be to work out a credit giving system. If i admin this (which i probably will) i'd like to have that every week. Every faction will be given starting credit, which they can either use or save for later. They will also get weekly credit. Sunday would be credit giving day, and Monday and Tuesday would be used for building. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are general operations days, and Satruday is large battle day. Heres an idea for the budget:
<br />
<br />Starting Budget: Everything in ks.  All groups get bonuses:

<br />Battle system: All the forces on either side will be totalled up with a point system (which i will work out), and turned into a ratio that will be cancled down as far as possible. If (eg) Corsairs and Outcasts were having a battle, and the Ratio was (Corsairs 2:1 Outcasts), the Corsairs would get 10 coin spins, and the Outcasts 5.  Whoever gets more heads wins. The Corsairs, having twice as many forces, have the twice the chance of winning.
