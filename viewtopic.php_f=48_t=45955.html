			<div class="content">Hello; I've been mucking around in Freelancer here and there for the past two years now(since I got the game in '05; it's one of my *absolute* favorite games). I have a very neat(I think) idea for an MP mod, but it will require a LOT of work. I am an INI coder, I can write up weapons and INI-code ships and general INI work; but that's about it. I never got the hang of shipbuilding(then again my only tool was 3DSMax 7, and I never was able to figure out Milkshape. . .), and system forging is COMPLETELY out of my league; but I can edit existing code; and even make new code when it comes to weapons, or adding encounter areas to systems and what not.
<br />
<br />ANYway, now comes the actual concept.
<br />
<br />(from the perspective of an Indy Worlds bounty hunter.)
<br />&quot;Tensions never really relaxed after the Nomad War that almost tore the Sirius Sector asunder. The might of the Rheinland empire was never checked, and it continued to grow -- battle hungry. The four houses' militaries continued to grow, border skirmishes along the Kusari-Rheinland border were kindling a slow blaze that has taken the past 100 years to ignite. It all happened when the president of Liberty issued a pre-emptive strike on all of her borders; physically the strongest yet beset on all sides by the mighty Rheinlanders, the noble Bretonians, and the imperialist Kusari. These pre-emptives have boiled-over the single largest war Sirius has ever seen; the Civil War between all four houses. A war which would stir an old enemy; coax a powerful ally back out from the shadows and make bounty hunting the most profitable profession out there. . .&quot;
<br />
<br />Premise: The entire sector is at war with each other. Kusari fights Rheinland, Liberty and Bretonia. Bretonia fights Liberty and Kusari. Rheinland fights Kusari and Liberty.
<br />
<br />Goals:
<br />A fully-dynamic MP RPG-style play experience. A core system will be created, that's neutral to everyone where the players will start. There, they'll buy their way into their faction.
<br />
<br />Fully-rebalanced ships and weapons according to set standards and house advantages.
<br />     
<br />     Ships
<br />     Bretonia: Good armor, average shield strength, good shield recharge, average shield offline time, average maneuverability, average speed, good energy capacity and average energy recharge.
<br />
<br />     Kusari: Poor armor, great shield strength, poor shield recharge, great shield offline time, good maneuverability, great speed, poor energy capacity and great energy recharge.
<br />
<br />     Liberty: Average armor, good shield strength, average shield recharge, good shield offline time, great maneuverability, good speed, average energy capacity and good energy recharge.
<br />
<br />     Rheinland: Great armor, poor shield strength, great shield recharge, poor shield offline time, poor maneuverability, poor speed, great energy capacity and poor energy recharge.
<br />
<br />A &quot;poor&quot; stat loses 25% off the base, a &quot;good&quot; stat gains 25% off the base, and a &quot;great&quot; stat gains 50% off the base. As you can see; Kusari ships have horrid armor, but excellent shields; paired with their fast-moving ships. Conversely, Rheinland has the heaviest armor with the worst speed and maneuverability, worst shield strength and shield offline time, but their shields regenerate quickly to compensate.
<br />
<br />Several new &quot;battlezone&quot; maps that are empty save for bases; 1 for all four factions to slug it out in, 1 for each faction paired battles.
<br />
<br />Upgrades which allow further customization of ships; like armor, shield and energy rechargers. Obviously, the superior ship would be the one that could mount a mix of all of the houses' weaponry and gear; but good luck doing that.
<br />
<br />New ship classes: strike bomber; heavy bomber. These beasts of explosive burden are designed to take down the huge capital ships; carrying multiple torpedo launchers with intent to kill. They have limited weapon systems and are very sluggish, as such they require escort and support from fighters.
<br />
<br />Flyable capital ships: House capital ships will be able to be flown; they are some of the most powerful vessels known though fighters can pick them apart since their inaccurate and slow-firing weapons are meant for ship-to-ship engagements.
<br />
<br />A new MP game; destroy the bases. When a faction loses all of its bases, it's removed from the game temporarily. The game will last for a set amount of time; the one with the highest bases % will win.
<br />
<br />-- Expansion 1 Goals:
<br />Three new great factions appear on the scene, bringing the total factions to 7. The Outcasts, the Bounty Hunters and the Corsairs.
<br />
<br />Capital ships; a gunship/frigate, a cruiser/dreadnought, a battlecruiser/battleship for each of the 3 new factions.
<br />
<br />Bombers for each one as well, of course. . .it would be interesting to see a Bounty Hunter bomber.
<br />
<br />WHAT I WILL NEED:
<br />Possibly other coders to help me code everything in.
<br />System forges, definitely. I cannot create systems on my own. . .
<br />Expansion: Shipwrights.
<br />
<br />Anyway, there will be more to come -- feel free to post your thoughts and suggestions. A demo will be coming soon, &quot;Worlds at War: Rheinland Invades!&quot; which will feature the New York system besieged by Rheinlanders.

<br />&quot;Alright, this is your last chance! Hand it over!&quot;</div>
