			<div class="content">Alistair Grey/Cavalier/New York System/Bretonia Police Authority
<br />
<br />The Liberty strike force's advance scout, Razor 1-1, radioed in loudly over the channel: &quot;All units, all units this is priority one. Two battleships are heading for Planet Manhattan.  One has a very large plasma bomb.  The base is a diversion!  Uploading waypoint. Hurry, we haven't got much time!&quot;
<br />
<br />Chief Constable Alistair Grey's face blanched as he heard that.  The Bretonians were going to attack Manhattan.  They were going to destroy Manhattan!  This was insane!  Capturing the Liberty capital to demoralize the Navy was one thing, but to destroy the planet itself, kill all those innocent civilians.  This was a war crime.
<br />
<br />He wasn't about to let it happen on his watch.  He keyed his comm.  &quot;This is Bretonia Police Red 1-1.  All Cavaliers form on me.  We're breaking off to intercept the bomb.&quot;
<br />The action was unnecessary.  The entire strike force changed their heading and turned towards the two Bretonian battleships that Razor 1-1 had tagged.  They were already starting to be silouhetted against the sun's corona.  Their cruise engines already at full steam, they were catching up quickly.
<br />
<br />The comm came alive.
<br />&quot;This is the <i>Oregon </i>.  We've alerted Manhattan to the incoming weapon and they're pulling in fighters from Fort Bush as a last line of defense.  When we reach the weapon, the <i>Mt. McKinley </i> and the <i>St. Louis </i> will concentrate primary fire on the battleship towing the fusion bomb.  All fighters will handle the escorts.  We'll cover the bomb and try to dispatch a heavy lifter to capture it.  Under no circumstances must that weapon reach Manhattan!&quot;
<br />Edwards' voice came across the channel.  &quot;This is Liberty Police Blue 1-1.  Oregon, has the president been evacuated?&quot;
<br />&quot;Blue 1-1, the president was moved to Newark Station in case a speedy escape was needed.  The Battleship <i>Wisconsin </i> will transport her to Fort Bush pending the outcome of this battle.  Worse comes to worst, she'll be evacuated to Planet Denver.&quot;
<br />&quot;Acknowledged.&quot;
<br />
<br />After a few more moments, they came within a few kilometers of the Bretonian strike force and dropped out of cruise speed.  Grey hoped this wouldn't turn into a battle.  He'd felt guilty enough attacking the BAF Crusaders back in Magellan.  They were his countrymen after all.
<br />Grey keyed his comm again.  &quot;<i>Oregon </i>, this is Bretonia Police Red 1-1.  Request permission to hail the strike force.  I might be able to talk them out of it.&quot;
<br />There was a pause across the channel.  &quot;Make it quick, Red Leader.  We can't dawdle for long.&quot;
<br />&quot;Understood,&quot; Grey replied.  &quot;Red Flight, form up on me.&quot;  The dozen Cavaliers engaged thrusters, pushing ahead of the pursuing Liberty craft.  They were about 1.5 kilometers away when Grey keyed his comm to all channels.
<br />
<br />&quot;Attention Bretonian strike force, this is Bretonia Police Red 1-1, Chief Constable Alistair Grey speaking.  Gentlemen, I'm sure you've been given orders to launch this weapon against Planet Manhattan, but think about what you're about to do.  You're going to destroy a planet, with millions of innocent civilians.  There's a difference between taking the capital intact and obliterating it.
<br />&quot;Don't get me wrong, I answer to the crown too.  I believe in Bretonia, even despite all the bloody insane policies Wessex put in place.  But I swear, if you do this, the blood of millions of human beings will be on your hands, and it will never wash away.  For God's sakes, can you live with yourselves if you kill all these people?  They're civilians, not military.  I'm begging you, don't do this... don't do the devil's work.  Take this weapon out of Liberty, and the Navy will let you go freely.  Please mates... don't commit mass murder in the name of glory.  There's nothing glorious about it.&quot;
<br />
<br />Grey waited uneasily as silence settled over the comm frequency, and the Liberty pursuers set into formation directly behind them.

<br />The words of the bretonian constable echoed through rich's mind he started to wonder if it would be worth doing this so he opened a comm to the constable
<br />&quot;Listen mate, tell everyone to evecuate to alaska you've got 10 mins then i'll stop this bomb please do this i have a plan to stop it but i need u out of this system, alaska is the only safe place the BAF is everwhere else please get everyone out...&quot;
<br />Rich then went over his calculations it would work but the liberty navy had to evacuat as quickly as possible and so to buy time he fired his torpedos strait at the lead battleships engine to buy more time
<br />&quot;Please go i dont know how long i can hold them off......&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />Grey knew he'd struck a nerve somewhere in the midst of the attack fleet.  And thankfully, they were willing to help.  He'd gotten through, even it if was just one Crusader that was now opening fire on the battleship.  Nonetheless, he'd heeded the officer's words.  He opened his comm to the Liberty fleet behind him.
<br />
<br />&quot;I made contact.  One of the Crusaders is disabling the lead battleship's engine.  He needs you blokes out of the system, so clear off to Alaska.&quot;
<br />&quot;This is the <i>Oregon </i>.  Negative.  We are not going to disengage pursuit.  They're only about 25 kilometers away from Manhattan-&quot;
<br />Edwards' voice cut in.  &quot;<i>Oregon </i>, this is Blue 1-1.  We'll watch over things.  You and the other Navy boys get to Zone 21 and get through that gate.  We'll advise you when the coast is clear.&quot;
<br />Yet another pause across the channel.  &quot;This is the <i>Oregon </i>.  All Navy fighters disengage and form up on us.  Plot heading for Zone 21.  The <i>Mt. McKinley </i> and the <i>St. Louis </i> will remain here and provice heavy fire support.  Agreed?&quot;
<br />Neither Edwards, nor Grey had any qualms with that.  They could probably use the heavy cannons to take out the battleship's engines in the long run.
<br />
<br />Soon after, the Liberty battleship, two squadrons of Defenders and one more of Patriots disengaged, turned, and headed at cruise speed for Zone 21.
<br />Grey keyed his comm to the Crusader that was now attacking.  &quot;We're not leaving you to fend off these bullocks by yourself, mate!  Moving to attack!&quot;
<br />Edwards' voice came across the channel as well.  &quot;Blue Flight, overlap Red Flight's formation, provide suppressing fire.  Cruiser wing, target your primary cannons on the lead battleship's engine.  We have to disable it!&quot;
<br />A series of acknowledgements echoed across as a dozen Cavaliers and a dozen Patriots, trailed by two cruisers, entered into the foray, streaking for the battleship carrying the planet-killing bomb.
<br />&quot;Target locked!&quot; someone cried out.
<br />Grey didn't hesistate.
<br />
<br />&quot;<i>FIRE! </i>&quot;</div>

<br />Sparks flew from rich's console as he relised he would have to operate his plan now.
<br />
<br />He engaged his tractor beam and latched onto the bomp wrenching it from the battleship cusing the magnetic locks to attach the bomb to his ship he then gave full power to his engines and entered the suns gravity well on a slingshot orbit slinging him much faster than the BAF could keep up at flining him towards zone 21. Once safe he opened comm with the liberty navy
<br />&quot;Tell your people to evacuate all of the people to alaska its the only safe place now the BAF is coming with many more ships and bombs we have to leave now!&quot; and he hoped for once the navy would listen.........</div>

<br />
<br />&quot;Break off!&quot; Edwards called out as he saw the Crusader yank the bomb off and streak away for Zone 21.  That was confusing, but at the moment, the bomb was free.  That was what mattered.  In tight formation, the two dozen police fighters turned hard away from the fleet, using the same maneuver to slingshot around the sun.  With their cruise engines engaged along the way, they sped towards the lone escaping Crusader at incredible speed, soon catching up to him.  The BAF Crusaders behind them had turned as well in pursuit of the bomb to recapture it, but they were slow on the draw, plenty of distance between them.
<br />
<br />Edwards Patriot pulled up next to the Crusader, their engines screaming as they streaked towards Zone 21.  He keyed his comm.  &quot;Mind telling us what your plan is before I try to get an entire Navy fleet to go into a restricted military zone?&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Nathan Edwards/Patriot/Zone 21, New York System/Liberty Police
<br />
<br />Edwards couldn't believe it.  King Wessex of Bretonia had officially lost it in his mind.  The Supernova Cannon.  It definitely sounded bad.  And if it was more powerful than this fusion bomb they were carting away now-
<br />
<br />Wait a minute!  He keyed his comm to the cruisers that were covering them from behind.  &quot;<i>Mt. McKinley </i> and <i>St. Louis </i>, this is Blue 1-1.  Disengage and head for Zone 21 immediately. I'll explain later, but we'll need your cannons later.&quot;
<br />&quot;Acknowledged.&quot;
<br />
<br />He keyed back to the channel with the Crusader.  &quot;We can use that bomb!  When the vessel carrying the Supernova Cannon arrives, we can use the bomb to take it out!  We can't just let them destroy New York!  It'd destabilize all of Sirius!&quot;
<br />&quot;No doubt, but I'm working on a trump card anyways,&quot; Grey interjected.
<br />&quot;And what's that?&quot; Edwards asked.
<br />&quot;I contacted my second-in-command back in Manchester.  He's collected all BPA forces in the Manchester System and is leading them towards New London.  He's also contacting as many BAF officers as he can.  They're heading right for Planet New London.&quot;
<br />&quot;To do what?&quot;
<br />Grey took a moment before answering.  &quot;They're going to arrest King Wessex.&quot;</div>

<br />
<br />As Kiron sat at the bar. &quot; Lord Wessex is too ambitious, said a fellow junker. Now he wants to take control of Traflagar. He already statred hid preparations.&quot;
<br />&quot; We cant allow the base to fall, every single pilot of the junkers should get ready to depart for Traflagar to aid its defence. Freighter pilots can leave their ships in exchange for a bloodhound or dagger.&quot; The junker CO had announced
<br />
<br />&quot; A few more hours before departing&quot; siad Kiron to his friends, he had been given a dagger to fly in the fight ahead. &quot; Soon this base will be quite empty for a while. The Cosairs, Mollys and Gaians have agreed to help defend the base as well. Lets hope they dont start a fight among themselves or it will be plain stupid.&quot;
<br />
<br />Kiron looked out at the window and saw Planet Manhanthan, too bad he would have to leave the lovely view soon. News had carried reports of West Point being blowed to Kingdom come. The Junker CO had also talked off entering a temporary alliance to fight Bretonia although not formed yet, it was possible.</div>

			<div class="content">Kiron/Dagger/Outside Traflagar Base/Junkers
<br />
<br />Kiron and the rest of the junkers from Rochestor had already made their way towards Traflagar, Rochestor was now very empty.
<br />
<br />As they approached Traflgar, they saw that it was under attack by some Crusaders and calviers. 
<br />
<br />&quot; All Junkers, break formation and attack the hostiles&quot; said the CO, and within a second the base was safe as the destroyed ships floated around.
<br />
<br />&quot; those were just scouts&quot; warned Traflagar suddenly,&quot; The main fleet is approaching, scanners indicate a battleship,2 destroyers, 3 gunships and a lot of fighters!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; Uh-oh&quot; thought Kiron.
<br />
<br />&quot; This is Trfalgar to anyone in the area, we require immediate assistance, we are being assaulted by Bretonia capital ships!&quot; As the battleship came into view, the alliance of cosairs, junkers, mollys and gaians coulnt help but few a bit nervous.</div>
