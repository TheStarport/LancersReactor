			<div class="content">Let me review some of the capships gun configuration: 
<br />Tempest Main Gun: 2500x2(physical+explosion damage)/sec = 5000 dmg/sec, at 500 power consumption, refire delay: 2 secs, cargo space occupied: 50
<br />Damocles main gun: damage 20000x2 = 40000, power usage: 7500, refire delay: 8 secs
<br />Naginata Forward gun: damage 10000x2 = 20000, power usage: 5000, refire delay: 5 secs. AS you see these wepoans are balanced in terms of dmg/fire rate/power consumption.
<br />Note the hugfe refire delay and the very high energy consumption. These weapons do NOT work well on fighters and were not designed for fighters. It's very hard to hit a fast moving, evasive target with a weapon with an average fire delay of 5 secs, and that's sucking up almost all your power in one shot.
<br />If you wanna take down fighters wityh capships, use the AA and SAM turrets, not the main guns. And if you're in a fighter wanting to take on a capship, use torps or high level fighter guns, rocket pods and so on.</div>

			<div class="content">I have Rebalance 3.12. Anyway I have a couple issues with it. First of all I think the ship's max and afteburn speeds should be toned way down. I don't think any ship should be able to afterburn faster than they can boost. I also think the ship's normal speeds should vary from 60-100, with 60 being freighters, 100 being light fighters, and hf's and vhf's being in the middle somewhere. I think afterburn speed should remain at a constant 200, because it's kinda cheesy to turn the afterburn on my souped up eagle and be going almost twice as fast as my cruise speed.
<br />
<br />The battleships, cruisers, and gunboats are too fast and too maneuverable. I think the capital ships non-cruise max speeds should vary between 10-20 depending on the class of the ship, and their maneuverability should be cut in half. They also shouldn't be allowed to mount afterburn thrusters. They have shields, so they should already be able to take their fair share of damage without support, but they really shouldn't be able to fight totally unassisted against vast hoardes of fighters.
<br />
<br />I've noticed that a lot of the new weapons have high refire rates and use graphics effects that fill the screen and can cause framerate slowdown, particularily I've noticed the pulsar gun (or whichever gun is supposed to distribute damage evenly) does this. This seems like a gateway to cheesy spamming to me, and I think the weapon effects should be toned down a little so people don't get their framerates bogged down.
<br />
<br />Finally, since the guns seem to be so much powerful in this mod than in the regular game, I think the number of hardpoints the fighters mount in this mod should be cut in half. Once again I have issues with spam and possible server overloading, and I just think it makes for a nicer more balanced game if every fighter doesn't just mount 10 level 10 guns and 2 turrets.
<br />
<br />Anyway, thank you for reading my enormous rant on the Freelancer Rebalance mod.  While I enjoy the new features that have been added to the rather spartan original game, I can't help but  wonder why it's called &quot;Rebalance&quot; with all the cheese that seems to have been added to the game as well. I am not a game developer or modder, and I would appreciate it if you seriously consider my arguments.</div>

			<div class="content">If you like fighters with less guns, there are so many .. and I mean MANY, ships with half the weapon slots. Lets see you use a weapon type (pulse, tachyon, etc) and try kill an enemy with a shield immune to your weapons. Some ships already have only 4 slots, and cut to half? What u gonna do? Shoot flies? Or space dust?
<br />
<br />Reason of having a number of gun slots if because you can mount on various weapon types. You should try killing a saber with a c9 Champion Shield with 2 Positron weapons. If you can do that within 1 min 30 sec. ^_^
<br />
<br />The more slots, the less the weaknesses you have against various shield types.</div>

			<div class="content">kakepie, i've read your post and here's the answer:
<br />first of all, the rebalance mod is also for fun, not only for the sake of rebalancing everything. 
<br />-if the burners will all give 200 speed, what will be the difference between them? i personally i would not give any credits just for an increased burn time. it's gotta be another improvement to making buying a new burner worth it.
<br />-with default engines, the afterburner does not give you more than 300 speed, not even on a light fighter. and the cruise speed is really set at 450 not 300, even if it shows 300 on the hud. if you buy an upgrade engine is another matter, but it still can take you up to 450 with Upgrade engine MKIV, so it's not going over the 450 cruise speed limit. Anyway the scalling of speed between 60 to 100 it's not a bad suggestion and i'll think about it, it'll reduce the overall burner speed to all ships. 
<br />-battleships can't  have their speed reduced to 20 and the afterburners removed...a capship it's takin a lot more shield and hull damage cause they're so big, so it's got to have a possibility to avoid incoming fire. I prefered to increase the mass of the batteships and let the mass inertia do the job of reducing maneuvrability instead of adding impossible angular drags to all capital ships, like in TNG for example. That will only make the capships very hard to steer, and almost impossible to fly.
<br />-the new guns that high refire rates got to have explosion graphics that match the stats of the gun, because they have real explosive shells, just like missiles. I was undecided what impact effect to use at the begining, between the missile effect(smaller) and the flak cannon effect(bigger). I used the flak cannon effect till now but since everyone is complaininig about lag in MP, I'll reduce the cannon effects to missiles impact.
<br />-i don't think reducing the number of HP's is a solution. I initially increased the number of weapon HP's to every class of fighter in order to offer the player more tactical posibilities, not to augment their firepower. for example you'll be able to mount a pair of each type of guns on a VHF(there are 4 types), so you can deal with any type of shield.
<br /> Also please take a look at the guns you say are now more uber and u'll notice that the energy consumption has increased proportinaly as well. So mounting too many high class guns on a ship will quicky drain the powerplant on firing renfering them useless. There are now many defensive equipments that protect a ship from damage better that in the original game(like Shield Capacitors), so MP PvP is still balanced. Also the AI enemies have now fast recharge shields, and also more guns, and the Battleships from the BS killing missions require a lot of firepower so this requires more Hp's as well.
<br />

<br />Not a Rebalance Mod problem. This is not the first time it happened. Just wanted to post this up to see if anyone else playing the FL Rebalance Mod online experienced this problem.

<br />I leveled up so hard, spent my time, and poof. In a sec, my character was gone and unusable T_T What is the situation? Server states my character is still there. But character does not appear on list when you join server.</div>

			<div class="content">Just so you know, to make the point that the damocles small turret needs balancing, i can mount 16 of them on a tempest, and still have the main guns of the tempest.  Sure you want to face 1.2 milllion dmg a second?
<br />A good number would more likely be around (following dmg lines like the damocles large) 4000/2500 shield/hull a second.. say 100 refire still 40 shield 25 hull a second at 15 cost, that seems alot more reasonable to me since the large turret is .4 refire 9000/6000 a shot(4500/3000 a second roughly).
<br />
<br />Large turret should do more dmg overall than the small i say.</div>

			<div class="content">Lex, those Damocles turrets were in fact let as they were in Fightspace, but there the damages for the main guns were huge. Since i knew the Damocles will not work in RB, i didn't modified those turrets in any way. Perhaps i should remove the entirely, anyway they're gonna be balanced in the next version.
<br />
<br />&lt;corection&gt; after taking a look at the Fightspace gun specs, the Damocles small turret was doing 5000 damage/sec at 100/sec refire rate and only 25 energy consumption, while the Damocles main gun was doing 800000 explosion damage
<br />and 800000 normal damage for an incredible total of 1600000 damage, at 8 sec refire rate, with 20000 energy draw. So you see these guns were dramticaly scaled down already. Anyway in v3.2, the Damocles small turrets will only do 25 damage at 100 refire rate = 2500 damage /sec. 
<br />
<br />I dont know why that server error occured gshark, it never happened to me but then again i spend considerably less hours testing MP than you play.
<br />
<br />I don't think i'm gonna add the Mig or the Me-262, toco. There are already too many ships in Rebalance i don't think adding a WW2 or modern era jet will be an improvement. i prefer more realistic ships, or original designs.
<br />
<br />I however debuged the TIE's and two of them are working in MP v1.1 with no errors: the TIE Fighter and the Interceptor. The TIE weapons are also safe to use in a 1.1 MP server. The others plus the Sky Hawk are still giving the error message: &quot;Possible cheating detected: Ship or equipment not sold on base&quot;, and the server kicks out the payer who buys them.
<br />
<br />Update: The TIE defender is working with one condition: if one does not buy the TIE weapons in the same time. The other two TIE's(Fighter and interceptor) are working regardless of this condition.
