<br />
<br />the group off pirates toke me to their base, their they didn't knew what to do with me... i asked them from what pirate or criminal faction they are...
<br />
<br />their commander (i think); &quot;we have peace with almost all criminals around, but we belong to nobody, we are a loose pirate group... we are real hardcore pirates.
<br />we are now at alcatrez base, rogues own this pace, but bring us the needable ships...
<br />
<br />i walked with the pirate group into the bar, all where looking to us... i see that some off the group where i'm with have div outfits... 
<br />one have a rogue outfit, an other a xenos outfit... 2 have junkers outfits, it's strange but the one next to me has an old bounty hunter outfit with he may won from a bounty hunter with he killed... and some other outfits aswell...
<br />
<br />i asked the one with the bounty hunter outfit if i may join their pirate group... 
<br />he said to me that i must go first for a ship, and after that we will see what happends...
<br />
<br />i talked a while with the bartender and he had a job for me, i will get a ship wor that and weap-outload. and i will get at the end off the job 500 credits. i accepted.
<br />
<br />he brought me to a dagger with 4 azreals on it.

<br /><b>Faction:     </b> Outcast
<br /><b>Location:     </b> Omicron Alpha
<br /><b>Credits:     </b> 1,302,500
<br />
<br />Magmus walked into the Bar and approached the Barman...
<br />
<br />&quot;Got any new stuff in? Im fed up with that damn cheap crap you serve...&quot;
<br />
<br />The Barman slid a glass across the table towards Magmus and filled it with an Orange Liquid
<br />
<br />&quot;Got a crate of this stuff in just this morning... Its quite popular in Bretonia I hear...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Hmm Sidewinder Fang hey...&quot; Magmus Downed the drink &quot;Well anything is better than that other crap you got... so anything happening around here that I should know about?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It just so happens that I heard over the Outcast news network that the Corsairs and Outcasts are teaming up and attacking Bretonian space... I think it has something to do with an Illness that has spread through the Major Houses&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Really? I wonder if Commander Gill  has any more information on this... thanks for the Info and the Drink...&quot; Magmus placed a few credits on the table and headed for the exit
<br />
<br />&quot;HEY YOU TRADER BOY!&quot; A drunken Outcast fighter pilot stopped Magmus before he could exit the bar
<br />
<br />&quot;DONT IGNORE ME TRADER BOY! I heard that you were late again&quot; The pilot turned to his other Pilot friends and started laughing &quot;Traders who needs them&quot;
<br />
<br />Magmus smiled and walked over to the table that the pilot and his friends was at, a pilot from a table at the other side of the bar ran over to Magmus and grabbed him by the shoulder
<br />
<br />&quot;Don&#8217;t do it Magmus... you'll get you're cargo impounded again&quot;
<br />
<br />Magmus sighed...
<br />
<br />&quot;I suppose you're right Rathe &quot;
<br />
<br />Magmus turned and shook his friends hand...
<br />
<br />&quot;It's good to see you again Magmus, but let me deal with this first&quot;
<br />
<br />Rathe walked over to the drunk pilot and tapped him on the shoulder...
<br />
<br />&quot;What do you want flyboy... I was having fun with the trader over there&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That trader happens to be my Friend... You're not even half the pilot he is! Remember the GMG battle in the Sigma-13 system? He was the unidentified pilot who single-handedly diverted a Gunboat away from my Taskforce so that we could finish it off! He saved my men&#8217;s lives and mine that day! He&#8217;s the bravest man I know! And you have the audacity to make fun off him!&quot;
<br />
<br />Rathe Grunted and walked back to Magmus
<br />
<br />&quot;So anyway were where you heading before you were so rudely interrupted?&quot;
<br />
<br />(Killa what exactly in bretonia can we attack? can we destroy certan instilations? im thinking of doing somthing in Cambridge is their anything their you would like left alone?)

			<div class="content">Name: Pedro Villanueva
<br />Ship: Titan
<br />Faction: Corsairs
<br />Location: Omega-41
<br />Credits: 825,000
<br />
<br />Pedro sat in his quarters aboard Leon Base, looking at a datapad he held in his hands.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hmm... I've got Salamanca Mk. I's on my Titan, and I can get........3 Mk. II's without overloading my reactor...&quot;
<br />
<br />He was startled by an announcement over the base's comm system.
<br />
<br />&quot;ALL CORSAIRS, REPORT TO THE HANGAR BAY. REPEAT, ALL CORSAIRS ARE TO REPEAT TO THE HANGAR BAY.&quot;
<br />
<br />Pedro put down his datapad and rushed off to the hangar bay. As he arrived, he saw that it was packed with over 100 corsairs. The commander of the base was addressing them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Attention, Corsairs. We have signed a temporary treaty with the Outcasts-&quot;
<br />
<br />This caused an outburst of angry shouts from the crowd. The commander continued nonetheless.
<br />
<br />&quot;A deadly illness has been sweeping the House systems; their militaries and police have all been weakened. Both the Corsairs and the Outcasts see this as an opportunity to launch attacks, and perhaps gain more power in the Sirius systems. We will band together and develop joint weapons, joint ships, and we will perform joint attacks. We will start with a pincer attack on Bretonia; Outcasts will go through the Tau systems and we will go through the Omega systems. Their police and militaries are already spread so thin, we think we will be able to take the outer Bretonia systems with few casualties. The Corsairs operating in Bretonia will press towards New London, causing the Bretonians to divert their defenses there. Corsairs stationed in Omega-5 will move into Cambridge and take it; while Outcasts from Tau 23 will move into Leeds. This is a list of all Corsairs who will be immediately sent on sorties into Bretonia...&quot;
<br />
<br />The commander started to read a long list of names. Pedro contemplated. If they could pull this off, the Outcasts and Corsairs would have a large amount of territory...
<br />
<br />&quot;...Pedro Villanueva......&quot;
<br />
<br />Pedro sighed. Of course he would be sent on a sortie, he was one of the best pilots in Leon.
<br />
<br />Twenty minutes later, he found himself in space along with a huge fleet of over 25 Titans and Centurions. They all moved to the Omega-11 jump hole.
<br />
<br />Pedro was puzzled as to why they didn't go directly to Omega-5; he hailed the group commander. The response he got made him smile; he prepped for combat....
<br />
<br />&quot;With a fleet this size, we're a sizable force for even a base to defend against.... We're going to show to Hessians in Omega 5 how powerful the Corsairs can be.&quot;
<br />
<br />With all ships through the jump hole, they set a course for Freital Base and prepared for combat...</div>

			<div class="content">Name: Serg Vorbarra
<br />Ship: Valkrye
<br />Credits: 105,000
<br />Faction: Rheinland Military
<br />&quot;Yeee-ahh!&quot; screamed Jurgen over the comm-link as the last Corsair was sent into a fiery death spin. They had been hunting the Corsairs that had began to trickle in from Omega 5. They must of finished off the Hessians in Omega 5 because Freital had been all but overrun. Serg's display showed no hostiles except some Hessians limping away but still he craned his neck around the cockpit. A massive fleet of Valkryes, supported by Gunboats floated outside in formation. &quot;Okay boys,&quot; came the Commander's raspy voice over the comm-link. &quot;Time to head home.&quot; A series of faint whoops and cheers flooded the comm-links as the fleet turned around and headed back to Stuttgart.
<br />
<br />--One day later--
<br />
<br />Serg and Jurgen strolled down Stuttgart's cobbled avenues glancing around the shop windows and street caf&#233;s. They clanked everytime they moved because as Rheinland was at war, normal military fatigues would not do. Futuristic german helmets sat atop their heads and they had Daumann Perforaters tucked in to their brown leather holsters. Utility belts and ammo pouches covered them and a Detroit Landblaster pulse assault rifle slung over their backs. 
<br />
<br />They walked out onto an alpine promenade and looked down into a gentle rolling valley. It used to be pretty, until Synth Foods came and covered it with their cellulose grey weed. Two pine trees swayed as a chilly mountain breeze swept through one of Stuttgart's many alpine towns. The capital city of Stuttgart was a gray/blue blur on the horizon. &quot;You know that the Outcasts are hitting Bretonia pretty hard&quot; said Jurgen suddenly. Serg looked up. &quot;Don't worry, we have the most poweful Military in the Sirius...they can't get us...Although I would like to think the other houses could defend themselves against some inbred druggies.&quot; he finished off. Jurgen laughed. &quot;Yeah...Damn Outcasts..&quot; All of a sudden there was a rucus at a nearby bar. The publican, a portly man with a thick flowing blond moustache came running out wheezing. &quot;Corsair spies!!! I overheard them talking and now they trash my bar!&quot; Serg's eyes narrowed. No matter how strict the border guards were, some pirate spies always managed to slip in somehow with the rough traffic heading in from the Border worlds. As they kicked open the ornately carved wooden doors Serg spotted them. Bronzed skin and latino features. They both had Salamanca pulse pistols drawn and were helping themselves to a drink. One of them held a struggling Policeman in a headlock. Serg grabbed his Daumann Perforator and fired off several shots off. The pirate fell writhing to the ground. The other glanced at his fallen comrade and let go of the young policeman who fell heavily to the ground. The pirate took off towards the back door and towards the village's local landing pad. &quot;Go after him!&quot; yelled Serg and Jurgen sprinted after him. Serg glanced at the pirate who was moaning on the floor. This was no mere pirate informer. Judging by the condition and the scars on his body this was a for real Corsair. Serg hauled him up on the bench and went to help the policeman. 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile the other pirate was sprinting down the concourse to his most likely stolen Hawk. He pushed all the other passers-bys on to the ground and this made things only easier for Jurgen. He unslung his Detroit Landblaster and fired three times. Three purplish blue bolts burnt massive holes through the Corsair and he was carried by them off the cliff that the landing pad was perched on. 
<br />
<br />Back at the bar, Serg had just got the shaken policeman to his feet when the Corsair sprung. He had regained conciousness and swung down on Serg. Serg winced with pain but reacted by sending his elbow into the Corsair's nose and swinging around with a mother of a punch. The Corsair was immediatly out cold and fell back into the bar and knocked over the drink tubes sending them shattering and liquid spewed everywhere. Serg rubbed his back ruefully and the Policeman gratefully thanked him and said he could take things from here. Serg walked outside into cobbled streets again and Jurgen joined him. &quot;We fight 'em in the air and we fight 'em on the ground.&quot; he said wearily. Serg chuckled. &quot;Yeah but we sure gave those guys a physical beating they're not likely to forget.&quot; Jurgen thought for a moment. &quot;Two less Corsairs in the Sirius we have to deal with...Heh, I'll make sure they get to Vierlande so there can be two more prisoner's *****es.&quot; Serg shook his head and laughed. &quot;Sounds like an ideal punishment....Let's head back to the Freidrich.&quot; They took a personal shuttle back to the capital city on Stuttgart where a gunboat was waiting to take them and the other crew on leave back to the Freidrich, currently in orbit around Baden Baden
<br />
<br />&quot;Good Lord Horatio! I do believe that is an extra-terrestrial space craft!&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">OOC: In case anyone's been wondering, when I write about Rheinland I tend to write that they have powerful armies and are as powerful as any of the other Houses. Check my first post on DragonBorns first RPG to see how I explain this.
<br />
<br />&quot;Defence is growing around Rheinland.&quot; mumered Jurgen as he held his face to the viewport. They were skimming the top of Suttgart Capital City. The policeforce were heavily armed to counter any trouble and had shoulder mounted Needler rifles and Detroit Landblasters. As the gunboat they were on entered the que for the docking ring, Serg sat back confident. &quot;Don't worry, I fear for Bretonia but the pirates <i>will not </i> and <b>can not </b> defeat the Rheinland war machine. After all, they are mere Pirates who do not have Battleships, gunboats or light fighters.&quot; Jurgen still looked uncertain. &quot;But what about the 80 year war?&quot; Serg thought for a moment. &quot;We are on home territory and our force is vastly superior in numbers and in craftsmanship...They <b>will not </b> take Stuttgart or any other Rheinland system. Of that, I am certain.&quot; Jurgen sat back as they entered space, confidant that his Flight Commander was right

<br />&quot; Okay everybody back? Good&quot; Hans said to the rest of his squardon. &quot; Head to the Stuugart Jumpgate, weve got new orders from high command to aid in the defence of stuugart should the need arise.&quot;
<br />
<br />As the squardon cruised towards the jumpgate, Hans told the suardon&quot; The outcasts and cosairs have formed an alliance and the outcasts are preparing to take Rheinland and Kusari.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; They're nuts&quot;, remarked one,&quot; how can they compare against our might?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot; ...... Inside information points that they have battleships ready.&quot; Hans said
<br />
<br />&quot; WHAT!!!???&quot; exclaimed the entire suqardon with shock
<br />
<br />&quot; They have apparently thought and designed AND built them while we were unaware.&quot; Hans replied.&quot; Enough chat, get into the jumpgate!&quot; as they approached the gate.
<br />
<br />With that the entire squardon headed to Stuugart.
<br />
<br />As they appeared on the other side, the battleship Schwiter hailed them.
<br />
<br />&quot; this is Hans Schewl, leader of Millitary squardon blue, we are here under orders to aid in the defence&quot;&quot; Affirmative Blue leader, you are cleared to proceed.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">Alrighty dudes, this is a big one. The Corsairs have joined forces and built several Battleships ready to over throw the Sirius government. With high hopes and good strategy, the Corsairs launch a full out attack on Bretonnia, and vice- versa with the Outcasts and Rheinland. The Corsairs are now in a battle for the Dublin and Edinburgh systems. And the Outcasts are launching an all out assault on Frankfurt. 
<br />
<br />Well there you go. Enjoy!
<br />
<br />And I'm just wondering, should I continue my Chaos Theory fanfic, because I have not had a hit on the topic for the past week. Until I know if you people think it is good, then I won't bother one of the Mods with it. So just let me know.

<br />Name: Nickolas Masters
<br />Ship: Sabre
<br />Faction: Outcasts
<br />Location: Omicron Gamma with strike group in the Tripoli debrese field
<br />Credits: 554,289
<br />
<br />
<br />  &quot;Outcast Strike Group Beta, this is Alpha leader, do you copy?&quot; Nickolas said into the radio.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alpha leader, this is Strike Group Beta. We are in posission and awaiting orders sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good, Alpha is reading green across the board. Were ready.&quot; Nick fired up his engiens and the other eleven members of his strike group did the same.
<br />
<br />&quot;OK guys, here's the flight plan. We each come in from diffrent sides. Alpha group will be with me and take the north side of Tripoli. Beta will take east, Gamma will take west and Delta will come in from the south. Now, our objective is simple, launch torpiedos and take out Tripoli shipyard.
