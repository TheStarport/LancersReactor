			<div class="content">this a small thing i have been writing and i am not finished but i thought that i should see what people think of a possible book.
<br />
<br />Faith
<br />By Gareth Todd Thompson
<br />
<br />
<br />Space. To a Scientist it is a collection of gasses and rock and ice. To a religious person it is god&#8217;s realm. But to a writer it is possibility.
<br />
<br />Arion Stepped of a shuttle and into the heart of Earth. People ran to greet him and others went about there work.  He was in the heart of Earth, over the years people felt were they came from and oddly returned to it. He was standing in the city Hontoim, people came fro the idle east and Africa at the dawn of time and now in the middle of it all stood Hontiom saying this is were we left and this is were we return. The city was amazingly big, Tokyo used to be the largest at 30 million in 2223, but now Hontiom was populated with 47,867,456 people. The heart of earth some would say, but bitter new Yorkers disagreed.  Reporters ran up to him with microphones, pushing and shoving to get a better place for today&#8217;s fad, space flight. 
<br />&#8220;Mr. Watts how does it feel to do what you did?&#8221; a reporter said.
<br />Arion smiled finding amusement in the question &#8220;speaking is a primitive form of passing ideas and yet it still is the best.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Mr. Watts, what do you mean by that&#8221; another reporter said
<br />&#8220;You want to tell me what it feels like to do what no one has ever done and risk of my life and finding the greatest reward.&#8221; Arion said, &#8220;That is impossible with words&#8221;
<br />&#8220;What is the great reward you claim to have found? Riches, love?&#8221; A reporter asked
<br />&#8220;Just by your guesses I can tell you that you would not understand what I found.&#8221; Arion said looking very amused. 
<br />&#8220;Mr. Watts why do you not answer our questions?&#8221; A reporter asked
<br />&#8220;you cannot understand&#8221; Arion said &#8216;Few can and few will. It is enough to make some go insane and others to never leave.&#8221; 
<br />Arion walked away to a car waiting for him. He opened the door and sat down. Looking out the window depressed him. He had found a great thing and he felt bad for those who did not have it. He smiled at his own thoughts, he had nothing he has seen much. And these people walked about there life as if nothing amazing was out there. It seemed odd that in the 28th century someone would find what he had found. After all he considered these the dark ages were science was religion. If you questioned the beliefs of science with supernatural beliefs then you are taken away and considered insane and a danger to younger people.
<br />It saddened him that in a era were people should be more advanced then ever they were living in a style that one could all the 1500 hundreds.  Arion knew the truth though these people were not taken away for treatment they were killed because they thought that science was wrong. Sadly Arion thought he was one of those people.  He knew the truth, and to science he was a fool. No evidence, no proof just what was called &#8216;faith&#8217;?  What people call faith is foolish hope and science has no room for blind faith. Arion had read if the 2757 massacre were a separate union of Faithers as they called people with Faith had assembled a colony and a small fighting force. They died for what they believed in, as the Science people came in and killed them all. They took science like a religion, calling in battle &#8220;for the advancement of the human race!&#8221;
<br />It disgusted arion. That men still killed each other for having different beliefs. And Arion thought he might die because of what he saw.</div>

			<div class="content">my next little bit
<br />
<br />Arion walked up to his house, were his dying father was. He walked in and walked towards the room were his father lay.
<br />&#8220;Father I thought you should know. I have done something no one has ever done. But I will do something greater or die trying. Yes father I know I am showing faith, but that is only part of my plan.  We live in a troubled world and I intend to change all of that. I know I am being impulsive and that this is not Scientific, or even rational I only hope that you can see it somehow&#8230;&#8221; Arion said as his father died, he didn&#8217;t even know if his father had heard him.
<br />&#8220;s-son.. if  you can h-help the world then you should&#8230;. M-my time was hard enough with the massacre and the brutal murder in the name of a flawed way of living. My father wrote a book upon the world he lived in before s-science seized power&#8230;&#8221; and then Arions father passed away, and Arion knew that now there was nothing to lose. 
<br />Arion was asleep that night when his phone rang. He got up out of bed and picked it up.
<br />&#8220;hello?&#8221; he said
<br />&#8220;I know what you truly believe&#8230; take a shuttle and meet me on the dark side of the moon&#8221;
<br />&#8220;There is nothing at the dark side of the moon.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Have faith!&#8221;
<br />Arion walked out of his house and got in his car. He drove to the launch pads and got into his private shuttle, a gift from the government thanking him for helping Science. He flew to the dark side of the moon and skimmed along the surface until his radio told him there was a incoming call. 
<br />&#8220;Hello?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Follow the red it leads to hope&#8221;
<br />Arion flew along till he noticed a line of red markers. He flew along them for a long time, wondering what this was all about. Then he saw a tunnel into the ground and red lights led into it. He went down into the tunnel until there was a landing pad. He gasped at what he saw there. He saw a Cross and the star of David and many other Religious symbols. But what he wondered is why they wanted him and how they knew he found faith.</div>

			<div class="content">&#8220;Who are you? Why did you want me? What is this?&#8221; Arion said.
<br />One of them stepped forward.
<br />&#8220;I am Jeremiah and I lead the last resort of faith far away from were god created humanity.&#8221; Jeremiah said
<br />&#8220;well.. Jeremiah you must understand&#8230; I&#8230;I am not o a know religion I saw something when I traveled through the wormhole and well I think it was proof of some sort of god&#8230;&#8221;
<br />&#8220;then we have no choice&#8221; Jeremiah said
<br />&#8220;choice about what?&#8221; Arion asked
<br />&#8220;We must bring back proof of this.. proof of god&#8221; Jeremiah said
<br />&#8220;no I am sorry Jeremiah.&#8221; Arion said &#8220;But the point I s faith not  proof if we find proof  then it says that we don&#8217;t need faith.&#8221; 
<br />&#8220;I disagree&#8221; Jeremiah said &#8220;you must go&#8221;
<br />&#8220;No&#8230;&#8221; Arion said &#8220;I will not destroy what others have died for&#8230; I will leave you&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Very well but we will find and open that wormhole&#8221; Jeremiah said &#8220;I would kill anyone who would stand in my way&#8221;
<br />&#8220;you are mislead Jeremiah&#8221; Arion said &#8220;We can bring ourselves out of this without hurting anyone&#8221;</div>

			<div class="content">I will do what I must to achieve our goal&#8221; Jeremiah said 
<br />&#8220;To do wrong with your own faith so you can force something on others&#8230;  it sad&#8221; Arion said
<br />&#8220;Enough! Tell me of what you saw!&#8221; Jeremiah said
<br />&#8220;You will not understand because you are not the right person&#8230; besides I respect the fact that some people want Science and others religion. But you are as bad as the government for forcing one view on people&#8221;
<br />
<br />Arion walked to his shuttle and launched. He was flying back to earth when a patrol stopped him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Arion Watts, you are under arrest for Religious beliefs and lie, without proof. You will be in court tomorrow until then you will come with us peacefully.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Of course&#8221; Arion said &#8216;I would never resist the law.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Right and that&#8217;s why you are breaking it.&#8221; The officer said
<br />
<br />Then a shuttle came out of no were and broadcasted a message &#8220;Police leave civilian ships alone that is a case of mistaken identity.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;and who are you&#8221; the officer asked
<br />&#8220;I am transmitting security codes to you.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know these&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Then I must make a report&#8221;
<br />&#8220;No worry I trust you&#8221; the officer said &#8220;civilian follow the other shuttle&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Yes sir&#8221; Arion said, &#8220;So who are you?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;I saw what happened on the moon.&#8217; The man said &#8216;they are fanatics and not true believers&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Its to bad.&#8221; Arion said, &#8220;While I look for truth and faith they spread trouble in the word of faith.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Yes it is a shame&#8221; the man said &#8220;but maybe can help you&#8221;
<br />&#8220;Oh really&#8221; Arion said &#8220;and how?&#8221;
<br />&#8220;There are quite a few people like you who have made a peaceful community that spreads knowledge on earth.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I Aliz lead these people. We can help you.&#8221;
<br />&#8220;I hope so&#8221; Arion said</div>

			<div class="content">And always reread it after you post it and make any changes you need, editing it. I have to go through mine at least 4 times to get it right. As to the time?, It tells others how important the story is to you. A hurried and poorly written tell you just want something to post, while a well wrtten one tell the story and what you like to write about. Put more time into it, if you have Word, WordPerfect or someother Word processore, use that to do a lot of the editing and it will save some time. ;
