			<div class="content">*sticks hand up and admits to loving Last Samurai too*
<br />
<br />Good call on Koyaanisqatsi and Boogie Nights, Taw.
<br />I've been trying to catch some of Kurosawa's stuff, in particular Ran, Rashomon, or Shichinin no Samurai (7 Samurai), but to obtain it legally would require far too much money seeing as it's being packaged for film buffs with lots of money and not a lowly student. They weren't readily available last time I had a look through the less than legal channels either.
<br />Little bit surprised by Eraserhead there, it's not exactly something I &quot;enjoyed&quot; watching but it was good fun just trying to make sense of some of the imagery and have conversations with my friends about it afterwards. (The ideas brought forth are pretty weird!)
<br />Downfall (Der Untergang) was incredible, I watched it the other night. The actor who played Hitler was incredible. Apparently he spent some time listening to recordings of Hitler at some sort of dinner party in Finland to accurately imitate his conversational stylings. The killing of Goebbels' children in particular sent chills down my spine.
<br />Also noticed a lot of Hayao Miyazaki films in the list, I saw Spirited Away in the cinema a few years ago and it reminded me of a lot of the weird fantasy movies and cartoons I enjoyed as a small child that really stretched the imagination.
<br />Forgot to mention City of God in my last list, that was an excellent movie. As well as, Shawshank Redemption, Cold Mountain, Memento, American History X, The Pianist, Rushmore, Trainspotting and Family Guy: The Movie <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>.
<br />Currently I'm trying to get hold of the original War and Peace filmed in Russia in the 1960s which apparently most closely follows the book itself. (I'm finally reaching the end of that enormous book!) I've seen some clips from it and the Battle of Borodino in particular looks nothing short of incredible with what must be tens of thousands of extras involved. Apparently after adjusting inflation over the years it's the most expensive film ever made.</div>

			<div class="content">more expensive than Anthony &amp; Cleopatra, or Kolberg? that would be incredible achievement in a perverse sort of way! love to find out..
<br />
<br />Downfall blew my mind, I saw it at the pix a few weeks ago. Incredible acting and casting, Magda Goebbels in particular. Weak ending i thought though. 
<br />
<br />Eraserhead, well there's nothing quite like it is there? it's unique; a very difficult film to watch and it's not *enjoyable* by any means except in it's hypnotic terror and revulsion and it's stunning cinematography.
<br />
<br />all Kurosawa's major films are available on Tartan Video and you can get them online from MovieMail. Ran cost me &#163;10.99. as an aside, when i first saw it I was on holiday in italy and it was dubbed into Italian! I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time as I was trying to translate the italian and missing the action or watching a key scene and missing the words, it gave a somewhat different slant to the experience. but it all came together when the sons started to fight each other and I pretty much figured out what they were on about after that. watching those armies maneuver and flow is like watching some sort of martial ballet, I always think, its actually quite beautiful.
<br />
<br />Poul Thomas Anderson is a wonderful director! loved Boogie Nights but never thought he'd come up with something as gob-smackingly brilliant as Magnolia, which was like a breath of fresh air when I was choking in a fog a mediocre Hollywood blockbusters and sequels. And it totally altered my opinion of Tom to the better, so I was happy with him later in Last Samurai as a result. I'm afraid my insurance-selling colleague wouldn't agree though. 
<br />
<br />I thought the pianist was excellent but I took serious issue with the way Polanski portrayed Szpilmann's meeting with Wilm Hosenfeld and their subsequent starnge relationship. Wilm Hosenfeld was shown as unsure and ambiguous, with the implication that his aiding and saving Szpilmann was opportunistic. In fact Horsfeld was already decided against the Nazis and had intervened to alter the fates of not a few jews already. Polanski chose to ignore this, was it for the sake of drama or was it because he couldn't accept that a German officer would willingly risk his life for a jew for reasons of morality? I feel this was a serious lapse in an otherwise outstanding film and Polanski perpetuated on the memory of Horsfeld a great injustice, one which Szpilmann himself had in former years tried to reverse.
<br />
<br />I wanted to say i liked Trainspotting as much as I did when it was first released, but I watched it recently and got nothing from it except a sort of *before they were famous* sensation. 
<br />
<br />and I'm belatedly including Gladiator 'cos it was a rip-roaring film that I enoyed every moment of and Big Russ was ace!

			<div class="content">I reckon it is easy to try and sound high brow when asked to compile such a list. I noticed last night while trying to find something to watch that my real favourites are pretty much what I listed earlier. They are not the most critically acclaimed as Grom noted, nor the most fantastic cinematography, directing, acting etc. They are instead the movies which are always easy to watch, entertaining and seemingly timeless in their premiss.(I left the Shawshank Redemption out of the list by mistake)
<br />
<br />some movies I have but have not watched of late:
<br />
<br />1:  Catch 22
<br />2:  One Flew Over the Coocoos' Nest
<br />3:  Taxi Driver
<br />4:  Apocalypse Now
<br />5:  The Deer hunter
<br />6:  The Long Good Friday
<br />7:  Fight Club
<br />8:  2001 A Space Odyssey
<br />9:  Scarface
<br />10:Bullit</div>

			<div class="content">I'll just pop up in favour of <i>A Boy And His Dog </i>.
<br />
<br />The pathetic wiki article:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_And_His_Dog">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_And_His_Dog</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It's just perfect in so many ways. Conventional methods might show it to be rubbish, but because it's so terribly terribly <i>bad </i>, it's brilliant. I can't exlain it, it has to be watched.
<br />
<br />Also, <i>Battle Royale </i>- probably one of the most famous Japanese movies in the west. Once they leave the classroom, it's sheer brilliance.

<br />M*A*S*H
<br />Enemy at the Gates
<br />Dracula (The version by Francis Ford Coopola of 1992, which is in my mind, for somone who has read the book six times, the best translation to white screen, asides from the Prologue, which only added to the atmosphere of the Legend of Vlad Draculea.)
<br />Glory
<br />Gettisburg (a four Hour sit really is TOO long!!)
<br />Braveheart
<br />The IRA Informant (I Cannot watch that Movie, its too strong for my stomach, but thats due to other factors...)
<br />Chaplin shorts
<br />Laurel and Hardy shorts (both from the silent age preferably)
<br />Zatoichi
<br />
<br />and many more, which I simply can't all remember, but off the top of my head, thats it</div>
