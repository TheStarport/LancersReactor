<br />----------------
<br />
<br />Disclaimer: Blablabla (see previous chapters)
<br /> 
<br />        Child of the Hispania, by Sybot
<br />
<br />        Chapter Seven: War in Sigma-13, Part Two: As Per Agreement 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Respond or we will open fire!&#8221; shouted the GMG pilot.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We do not want to fight you,&#8221; Botella finally managed to say, &#8220;we are only here to eliminate the Junkers&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, we will not tolerate such enormous movements of our enemies in Sigma-13,&#8221; the GMG replied angrily.
<br />
<br />&#8220;At least let us destroy this base, then we will leave in peace,&#8221; said Botella.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What a snivelling coward,&#8221; Juanita growled on a private channel to Paulo. He nodded in agreement. He would rather fight. They may be outnumbered, but half of the GMG fleet was made up of Hawks, which were very inferior to Centurions. Not to mention that they had the Cataphracts to back them up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ll consider it&#8230;&#8221; the GMG pilot started to say. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;DIE!&#8221; came a deafening yell across the main comm. channel, startling everybody. Paulo turned to its source and saw a group of ships charging out of the cloud in cruise mode. A lone Titan, about eight Centurions, the <i>Justinian </i>, and one other Cataphract, this one trailing smoke. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mendez!&#8221; Botella exclaimed in surprise, &#8220;what are you doing here!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Getting back at these GMG bastards!&#8221; roared Mendez, his voice filled with rage, &#8220;they killed most of my pilots!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I almost had the situation defused! You fool!&#8221; Botella shouted at Mendez. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;They destroyed the rest of our guys at Helgoland&#8230;&#8221; Paulo said, anger building.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Quiet Collazo, I&#8217;ll handle this!&#8221; the exasperated Botella shouted.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No!&#8221; yelled an angry voice from one of the Corsairs behind Paulo. A lone Centurion powered up its engines and flew out of the fleet towards the GMG fighters. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Take them down!&#8221; someone else hollered. One ship, then another, then another, started following the first on a mad charge to the enemy. Paulo followed suit, focusing on the battle to come. Soon the fleet was moving as one, leaving a protesting Botella and a few others behind. Paulo drew up alongside the <i>Theodora </i> as the battle drew nearer. He charged his guns and grabbed the controls tightly. Moments later the two groups collided.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look out!&#8221; Paulo didn&#8217;t need to be told twice. He dived below the main plane, just in time to avoid two missiles streaking past where he had once been. They hit the shields of the <i>Theodora </i>, creating a bright flare that Paulo&#8217;s HUD struggled to compensate for. The crashing of weapons on his shields was evident. He spun back into the furball, dodging and weaving around combatants. An explosion came from behind him and the rear view displayed a Hawk impacting a piece of debris and exploding. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Firing!&#8221; shouted the <i>Theodora </i>&#8217;s pilot. Paulo saw beams of light, followed closely by rocket trails, arc through the nebula. Everything in their path was destroyed. Paulo managed to get behind a Falcon. The shields were tougher than the CSVs. It took a bit longer, but eventually the shields went down. Paulo launched missiles, but the GMG pilot dropped countermeasures in time to evade them. Then a wave of fire swept across his path, blowing the Falcon in half. A Centurion missing a wing flew by a few metres in front of him. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yaaaaaaah!&#8221; came the unearthly yell of Mendez. His group impacted the battle, immediately smashing several GMG ships into pieces. A counterattack concentrated on the damaged Cataphract. Paulo was able to get behind one of the pilots attacking and took him down, but there were so many and the front of the Cataphract exploded in a blood red explosion. As he flew past the wreckage, Paulo could make out bodies leaking from the vast hole left by the death of the troop transport. That one did have a cargo. He silently prayed to those lost, then immediately turned back to the battle. Two Falcons had a Titan in their sights. He fired a volley into the nearest of the pair, and it sailed away, quickly activating its shield batteries. The Titan took the opportunity to cut its engines and turn 180 degrees. The second Falcon died in an overwhelming crossfire between the two Corsairs. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; the female pilot of the Titan said, before moving on rapidly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Collazo! Lucientes!&#8221; came the cry of Botella, &#8220;get back here now!&#8221; Paulo&#8217;s scanner revealed Botella&#8217;s Titan in a one-on-one duel with an Eagle, but the more manoeuvrable VHF was flying circles around their wing leader. Dodging past a wing of Hawks, Paulo abruptly found himself outside the battle, heading straight for Botella. Another Centurion linked up with him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Looks like we have to save him,&#8221; Juanita said, &#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll never the end of it after this&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Guess so,&#8221; Paulo chuckled. There was nothing like a good friend to distract you from the horrors of war. &#8220;Hang on, we&#8217;re coming into weapons range.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Got it,&#8221; replied Juanita. They drew so close together their wings were almost touching. The Eagle noticed they were approaching, and turned towards them. It activated its thrusters and went straight at them. The three ships opened fire at almost the same time. Corsair neutron blasters versus GMG photon cannons. The game: Chicken. Energy flew across the space between the Centurions and the Eagle, vaporising any debris unlucky enough to drift by. Paulo was worried whether his shields could hold against the superior weapons onboard an Eagle. After a few tense seconds the GMG pilot lost it. The Eagle pulled up when its shields finally went under the barrage, Botella&#8217;s Titan right behind it. A few moments later the GMG ship exploded thanks to one of the commander&#8217;s missiles.
<br />
<br />Juanita whooped with delight. &#8220;Nice shot Sir!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you, Lucientes,&#8221; Botella replied, sounding relieved, &#8220;now we need to get back to the fight. I didn&#8217;t start it, but by the Hispania, I&#8217;ll finish it&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s the attitude, Sir!&#8221; Paulo said. They reformed into a v-formation, with Botella at the head. After checking their weapons and making sure their shields were fully charged, they activated their cruise engines and ploughed through the nebula back to the battle. The situation was worse than it had been when Paulo and Juanita had left. Almost half the Corsairs had been destroyed, and the <i>Theodora </i> was being swarmed. This could easily become a defeat. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;This is bad&#8230;&#8221; muttered Botella.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Botella!&#8221; came the scream of Mendez, &#8220;get the hell over here!&#8221; The trio turned and saw the remaining Corsair forces rallying around the <i>Belisarius </i> and <i>Justinian </i>, including Mendez in his Titan. Evading random shots sent their direction by the GMG, the group crossed the battlefield and arrived at the pair of Cataphracts.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We have to withdraw!&#8221; cried the horrified pilot of the <i>Belisarius </i>, &#8220;they outnumber us three to one now! We can&#8217;t beat them!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I agree,&#8221; replied Mendez, &#8220;but we still have a job to do. You and the <i>Justinian </i> are to charge straight at Yanagi and open fire as quickly as you can. Once the depot is destroyed we will have accomplished what we came here to do and then we can retreat&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;They&#8217;ll destroy us!&#8221; the pilot continued.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ll cover you, now get on it,&#8221; Mendez growled.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Sir,&#8221; the pilot said with a gulp. The two Cataphracts powered up their engines. Meanwhile, the GMG had finished mopping up the Corsairs who had continued to fight when Mendez ordered the regroup. The <i>Theodora </i> was drifting lifelessly to one, venting atmosphere all over the place. The GMG ships were reforming into a battle line, a wall of ships between the Corsairs and Yanagi Depot.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Move out!&#8221; Mendez yelled, and started moving forward alongside the Cataphracts. The rest of the Corsairs tentatively began to follow him, knowing that this was one battle they probably wouldn&#8217;t return from. The odds were about twenty ships versus nearly sixty, not good by anybodies books. Paulo closed his eyes as the GMG fleet drew closer, waiting for the clash.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We have arrived,&#8221; came a Kusari voice. Paulo opened his eyes and stared in amazement at the sensors. At least one hundred new contacts had appeared. They were CSVs whose ID tags read Hogosha. Paulo had never expected the Kusari organisation to honour their agreement!
<br />
<br />&#8220;About damn time!&#8221; said Mendez. The GMG were caught off guard. Most of their forces spun and moved to engage the approaching craft. The Corsair forces smashed into the significantly weakened line and passed straight through without any casualties. Paulo broke formation and turned to engage any GMG that had survived the first pass. He noticed that most of the Corsairs followed suit, except for a few including Botella who continued to escort the Cataphracts. The first Hawk in his sights died quickly, and he managed to clip another with a missile, sending it whirling into a piece of wreckage.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look out!&#8221; exclaimed Juanita from somewhere out of sight. Something exploded above Paulo, knocking him from his pilot&#8217;s chair and into the side of the cockpit. He quickly leapt back in and turned to avoid hitting another piece of debris. Another missile sailed past, barely missing his left wing. He pulled up to try and shake off his pursuer, but the more manoeuvrable GMG craft easily kept pace with him. Suddenly he spotted a Centurion charging directly at him. It didn&#8217;t take much to realise Juanita&#8217;s plan. He turned on full acceleration and went straight towards her, with the GMG foolishly staying right behind him, pumping photon fire into Paulo&#8217;s shields. Paulo gulped as he used up his last shield battery. If they went down again he would be in real trouble. Juanita was in weapons range. Paulo quickly swerved to one side, and Juanita opened fire, catching the GMG pilot unawares. He exploded without getting a chance to react, and without a chance for Paulo to see what ship had been chasing him.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; Paulo exclaimed. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Juanita replied, sounding pleased with herself. Paulo smiled as she moved after another enemy, then got back into the battle. He took off after a Hawk that was milling around near the edge of the battle. A series of explosions in the distance marked the Hogosha and GMG fleets meeting. After the Hawk fell, Paulo turned back towards Yanagi. The remaining Junkers were putting up a half-hearted fight, but the few Corsairs left to guard the Cataphracts easily held them back. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Firing!&#8221; shouted the <i>Belisarius </i>&#8217; pilot, which gave a Centurion that had been flying around in front of the main guns of the Cataphract a chance to get out of the way. Once he was safe, the <i>Belisarius </i> and <i>Justinian </i> opened fire. Beams and rockets stormed a fiery path through the nebula. The station sat helplessly as the weapons approached it. There was not a movement visible. Either they had already left, or they all knew there was no chance of escape. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Here we go!&#8221; someone gleefully shouted. The first beams smashed into the station, leaving glowing patches of melting metal. The rockets came right behind them, blowing open holes in the hull of the Depot. One of the docking bays was completely blown off. The second volley passed right through the base. Explosions started happening across its bulk. The station gradually began to break apart, pieces drifting apart before exploding. The third volley annihilated what was left.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221; somebody else said, &#8220;can we go now?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think we can, as long as the Hogosha have our backs,&#8221; replied Mendez on the global channel, as if trying to unsubtly give a hint to their allies. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;It matters not,&#8221; responded the Hogosha commander, &#8220;they are retreating.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What!&#8221; Mendez exclaimed in surprise.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Its true, Sir,&#8221; said Paulo watching as the hostile contacts on his HUD began to disappear into the nebula. Out of the sixty ships that had engaged them just before the Hogosha arrived, only about ten were left.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well then, everybody follow me,&#8221; Mendez said. After thanking the Hogosha for their help, they swept the battlefield, picking up any Corsair survivors in escape pods, and giving swift and honourable deaths to any GMG or Junker survivors in escape pods. There was surprise when the <i>Theodora </i>, which had been drifting lifelessly with a lot of battle damage, powered up its engines and joined them. Apparently it had been playing dead after taking a battering from the GMG in order to survive. They took the long way round to the Sigma-13 jumphole to avoid encounters with hostile forces. After a few hours, they came into comm. range of Bruchsal Base. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Mendez!&#8221; came Elder Denaer&#8217;s voice, &#8220;what happened!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;The GMG attacked us in the middle of the operation,&#8221; Mendez replied.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I gave you eight Cataphracts and seventy fighters and you come back with three and fifteen!&#8221; Denaer yelled.
<br />
<br />&#8220;There were a hell of a lot of them, Elder, it seemed like their entire fleet,&#8221; Mendez replied, sounding apologetic.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What of Yanagi, and this &#8216;fleet&#8217;?&#8221; growled Denaer.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Depot is destroyed, and most of the GMG forces were destroyed when the Hogosha came up with a large force to assist us,&#8221; Mendez answered.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well I suppose &#8216;some&#8217; good came out of this endeavour, despite losing almost a quarter of the North Fleet,&#8221; Denaer said. Paulo wanted to say something to backup Mendez, but he knew it would be insubordination, and Denaer wasn&#8217;t in the best of moods.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Look at this,&#8221; Botella said on the wing only channel. Paulo stopped paying attention to the ongoing conversation and got his HUD to zoom in on Bruchsal. The asteroid was a mess. It was covered in craters where Corsair weapons had melted or blown off chunks of rock. There was one enormous hole on one side that looked like it had been blown out from the inside. Floating around the asteroid were the wreckages of at least three Cataphracts, and immeasurable Corsair and Bundshuch fighters.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Looks like we weren&#8217;t the only ones to get more than we bargained for,&#8221; said Paulo.
<br />
<br />&#8220;You can say that again,&#8221; replied Juanita. As they approached, they could see Corsair ships sifting through the wreckage, salvaging whatever they could. When they came to the main docking bay, the door had been completely blown open. They entered anyway.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />Next Chapter will be less action-based, and will also fill in details on what&#8217;s been happening elsewhere in the Road to Rheinland. I have two exams this week so I won&#8217;t be able to start it for a while yet since I&#8217;m concentrating on revision. 
<br />
<br />To Hahukum: The Bundshuch may be appearing in the next Chapter, but that isn&#8217;t certain yet
<br />   
<br />edit- put up the wrong version, this new one uses forum code

			<div class="content">This short news break shows the beginning of the ramifications of the battle between the Hogosha and GMG.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />Interlude 2: 
<br />
<br />All the news that&#8217;s fit for you, this is the Colony News Service.
<br />
<br />The situation in Kusari is rapidly degenerating. Rival groups are engaging in open combat across the House. Shogun Edo has demanded that the GMG cease all aggressive actions. Meanwhile, Samura forces are blockading all Kishiro facilities after they publicly supported the GMG. Blood Dragons are mounting all-out attacks on bases in Hokkaido. The GMG are actively hunting Hogosha across New Tokyo. This could lead to full-scale civil war.
<br />
<br />For those of you have been out of the loop, the current crisis began last week when Corsair forces mounted an attack on the Junker base in Sigma-13. The GMG tried to destroy the pirates, but a fleet of Hogosha ships arrived to support the Corsairs, forcing the GMG to retreat. The GMG announced a state of hostilities between them and the Hogosha. 
<br />
<br />The Kusari Government and Samura leapt to the Hogosha&#8217;s defence, saying that the GMG could not carry out an operation like this without the support of the authorities, which they didn&#8217;t have. Kishiro pledged its support to the GMG as part of their contract, whereby Kishiro will support the GMG in any actions they take. The Blood Dragon terrorist group has taken advantage of this turmoil and apparently begun a campaign to remove government and corporate forces from Hokkaido.
<br />
<br />Stay with CNS for more information as the situation develops.

<br />Disclaimer: Blablabla (see previous chapters)
<br /> 
<br />        Child of the Hispania, by Sybot
<br />
<br />        Chapter Eight: Progress
<br />
<br />Bruchsal Base was a mess. All the way from the hangers to the bar was a trail of destruction. Prisoners were carting away the bodies of their comrades under the watchful eyes of Corsair guards. Laser scorching could be seen on pretty much every surface. They passed by the huge crater they had seen from the outside. A shield covered the break in the corridor, preventing any decompression of the station. A Hispanic man stood guard over the generator.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What happened here?&#8221; asked Paulo.
<br />
<br />&#8220;The Bundshuch had a bomb, Sir,&#8221; Paulo was about to interrupt and correct him, but he realised the man was not wearing a Corsair uniform. He had probably been conscripted from Crete to join the infantry that the Cataphracts were supposed to carry. &#8220;They blew themselves up when we attempted to storm the control centre&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I see, thank you,&#8221; replied Paulo.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No problem, Sir!&#8221; the infantryman said, snapping to attention. Paulo, Juanita and Botella continued to the bar.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Those Bundshuch sound pretty fanatical,&#8221; Juanita noted. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;I know, and it worries me,&#8221; Botella replied, &#8220;the reports said they were little more than political dissidents, not the sort willing to blow&#8230;&#8221; He suddenly snapped to attention as a tall and elderly man rounded the corner in front of them. Paulo and Juanita followed suit when they realised who he was. &#8220;Elder Denaer!&#8221; exclaimed Botella.
<br />
<br />&#8220;At ease, Commander,&#8221; Denaer said, waving away their salute. The trio relaxed. Elder Denaer looked over them. &#8220;Remember there is a briefing at 0500 Crete Time tomorrow. I want to see you and your wing there&#8221; He turned and continued in the direction he had been heading.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Sir,&#8221; Botella said to the Elder&#8217;s departing figure. &#8220;We should get going,&#8221; he said to the others.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; replied Paulo. They started back on the path to the bar and eventually made it there without any further distractions. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Woooooh!&#8221; a drunken infantryman danced past them, cheering, as they entered the bar. The scenes were jubilant, even though the Corsairs didn&#8217;t feel it. People were dancing on tables; alcohol was flowing freely from the bar. The infantry were clearly pleased with their victory over the defenders of Bruchsal, but the heavy Corsair casualties at Yanagi and around the base weighed heavily on the minds of Paulo, Juanita and Botella. They spotted a group of fellow pilots sitting in a small, quiet, group near the bar. As they approached, the pilots looked up and greeted them with tired smiles.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Nice to see some fellow Corsairs,&#8221; said one, &#8220;from what I&#8217;ve heard, we&#8217;re a rare breed here in Frankfurt&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You&#8217;d be right too,&#8221; replied Paulo, sitting down, &#8220;we lost almost all of our forces in Sigma-13&#8221; Juanita sat down next to Paulo, but Botella remained standing.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t mean we should get in the way of the grunt&#8217;s fun,&#8221; said middle-aged female Corsair, &#8220;being in the infantry is far worse than being a pilot, from what I&#8217;ve heard&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;What can I get you good Hispanics?&#8221; asked a Rhinelander voice. Paulo turned sharply to see the face of a friendly-faced man behind the bar.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about Claus,&#8221; said one of the others with a grin, &#8220;he surrendered without resistance, and since he was the only one who knew how to get to the alcohol, the Elders let him go&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Er, what is there?&#8221; asked Paulo.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Liberty Ale, and not much else. Most of my stocks were destroyed in the blast,&#8221; replied Claus, shrugging.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll take one of those,&#8221; Paulo said, not really bothered; as long as it was better than some of the crunk they served on Crete he was happy.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Same here,&#8221; Juanita said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Nothing for me, thank you,&#8221; Botella said. He looked down at Paulo and Juanita. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get some sleep, I recommend you get some too&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;See you in the morning Commander,&#8221; Juanita said, almost sounding as if she wanted him to go.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bye,&#8221; Botella called over his shoulder as he weaved between infantry on his way out.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s with your attitude Juanita?&#8221; Paulo asked as soon as he was out of earshot.
<br />
<br />&#8220;He was going to sell us out to the GMG! Mendez had the right idea!&#8221; she answered angrily.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I agree, but we shouldn&#8217;t hold it against him, he was just doing what he thought was right to get us out of there!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Like Hell! He was just trying to get himself out of there!&#8221; Before Paulo could retort she continued, &#8220;and we wouldn&#8217;t have accomplished the mission if we&#8217;d have retreated, meaning even more lives would have lost in the return engagement!&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You have no way of knowing that Juanita. I think you just have something against him and you&#8217;re trying to think of excuses!&#8221;
<br />
<br />Juanita didn&#8217;t say anything. She just turned a bright red, got up and stormed out of the bar, knocking down some of the soldiers on her way out.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey! You forgot your drink!&#8221; Claus yelled after her. Paulo glared at him and the Rheinlander set Paulo&#8217;s drink down and skulked away. The other Corsairs, who up to this point had been watching with interest, finally decided to speak up.
<br />
<br />&#8220;She&#8217;s probably angry about all the deaths out there, don&#8217;t hold it against her,&#8221; said a female Corsair.
<br />
<br />&#8220;We all lost someone out there, and your girlfriend&#8217;s just looking for someone to blame,&#8221; a male Corsair continued.
<br />
<br />&#8220;She&#8217;s not my girlfriend, just a friend,&#8221; Paulo said, dejectedly waving away their words. He picked up his drink and took a mouthful. The Ale was so bad he grimaced and put the glass to one side. By now the others had given up on trying to talk to him, and were instead focused on a screen above the bar, which he also turned to look at. On it a pretty Hispanic woman was overlaid on images of battle, narrating them.
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230;Hessian forces were routed, marking a turning point in the battle for Omega-11.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, we have received our first reports from the North Fleet. Corsair forces have completed their objectives in that sector and now hold Bruchsal Base, an important staging area for further operations in Rheinland. I believe we can now go live to a reporter embedded in the primary force&#8221;
<br />
<br />The image changed to a man in civilian clothing on board what appeared to be a Cataphract. All the Corsairs paid more attention when they saw the man he was interviewing. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thanks, I&#8217;m here onboard the Constantine, one of out newest spacecraft, currently docked at Bruchsal Base, in the Frankfurt System. With me is Commander Mendez, one of the Corsairs responsible for taking this facility.&#8221; He took a small microphone from his pocket and handed it to Mendez. &#8220;So, Commander, how does victory taste?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Bitter,&#8221; Mendez responded curtly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Erm&#8230;&#8221; The reporter struggled to come up with something to continue from this unexpected reply, &#8220;And why is that?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;We lost many good people out there, and we&#8217;ll lose many more before this operation is over.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;There you have it, a day of celebration, but also of sadness, back to the studio,&#8221; said the reporter, rapidly ending the interview. The view shifted back to the female anchor, now with the Cretan skyline behind her.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Thank you Cesar. Meanwhile, closer to home, the Outcast delegation arrived on Crete just a few hours ago. Don Tieren, seen here leaving his transport alongside his son&#8230;&#8221; Paulo looked up in surprise to see the Outcast he had met on Freeport 9, alongside an older man who must be his father, walking down a ramp to be greeted by a group of Elders. He looked a lot healthier than when Paulo had last seen him. &#8220;&#8230;has entered Corsair space in the hope of resolving the territorial dispute between us and the Outcasts. The Don was quoted as saying &#8216;I look forward to closer relations between the disunited children of the Hispania. In other news two people were found murdered last night in&#8230;&#8221; Paulo turned away after that. Menito was on Crete. That was a shock. Not to mention the fact that his father was one of the Outcast leaders.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better get going, we have an early briefing tomorrow,&#8221; said one of the other Corsairs with a yawn. He stretched and got up. The others murmured agreement and followed him. Paulo was left alone. After a while the noise of the soldiers got irritating so he quickly finished his drink and got up to leave. After a visit to the quartermaster he managed to find his room, which was little more than a box with a bed and a console. Still, it was better than having to sleep in a Cataphract on bunk beds with hundreds of others. The walls were covered in propaganda posters, and all Paulo&#8217;s limited knowledge of the Rheinland language could decipher was lots of nonsense about a revolution.
<br />
<br />&#8220;One message received,&#8221; came a female Rheinlander voice from the console, startling Paulo. The computer repeated its message every thirty seconds. He sat down on the bed and reached over to press the accept button on the screen. A familiar face appeared, cheering Paulo up instantly.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hey, Paulo!&#8221; the Outcast said loudly. Menito looked cheerful, and a lot healthier, although he was still a bit gaunt. &#8220;I hope this message gets to you, I had a hell of a time finding out where you were staying. Here I am, on Crete.&#8221; He moved away from the camera briefly to show mountains in the background with a green sky behind them. &#8220;I have to say it&#8217;s a nice place, but I still like Malta better&#8221; They both grinned. &#8220;Hey, anyway, if you get this before I leave Crete, which will be about a week from now, send a reply to the address I&#8217;ve attached to the message. I&#8217;m here with my father to negotiate a treaty with you guys. Hey, isn&#8217;t that great! I always like seeing our two groups working together; although this operation you guys are doing out in Rheinland is a bit too secretive for my liking. My father is trying to convince your Elders to bring us in on the deal&#8221; Somebody said something too quiet to make out from off screen and Menito turned to look. &#8220;That&#8217;s my cue to go. Hey, see you later&#8221; The screen flashed off.
<br />
<br />Paulo blinked with tiredness. The reply would have to wait until morning. HE lay down in the bed and managed to quickly get to sleep.
<br />
<br />As Paulo entered the bar the following morning he was amazed at the difference. The rowdy revellers were gone and the lights were low. Corsairs sat silently on the chairs and tables in a semicircle around Elder Denaer who was standing on the bar with a holographic projector. He slipped in quietly and sat next to Botella who acknowledged his presence with a nod.
<br />
<br />&#8220;&#8230;losses far in excess of what we anticipated,&#8221; Denaer was saying when Paulo finally tuned into the briefing, &#8220;but it appears the first hurdle is now overcome. We have a firm hold here in the Frankfurt system. Our next goal should be to spread out and deal with the Rheinland Police force before they have a chance to react to our presence.&#8221; The hologram showed Corsair ships swarming into New Berlin and attacking bases in that system and Frankfurt.
<br />
<br />&#8220;A blitzkrieg?&#8221; Mendez, who was sitting at the front, asked. This got a few laughs from the assembled pilots.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Essentially, yes,&#8221; Denaer replied with a smile, &#8220;we must hit them quickly and eliminate as much of their offensive capability as possible before they can launch a counterattack. Our forces will split into three groups, two large and one small. The first is&#8230;&#8221; just as he was turning to activate the next image on the projector the whole bar began to glow red and blaring alarms rang through the base.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Attention! Incoming attackers! All Bundshuch pilots report to your ships!&#8221; Paulo didn&#8217;t even attempt to laugh at that; he was too busy trying to get up among the crowd of Corsairs now rushing around looking for something to do. Mendez was standing on a table in the middle of the confusion, his voice audible even over the sirens.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Patch the defenders through to the bar speakers and let me communicate with them!&#8221; he yelled into the ceiling. Someone must have been watching as the repeating announcement stopped and was replaced by a Hispanic voice.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sir! We have Sabres approaching on the base. We need support out here!&#8221; 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hold them back for now, backup is on the way!&#8221; Mendez jumped down from the table and began pushing through the crowd. As he went a steady stream of people began to follow him. Mendez had that sort of effect. Paulo linked up and eventually they made it out of the bar along with a lot of other pilots who were milling around with nowhere to go. The result was a massive crush as everyone tried to squeeze down the narrow corridors leading to the hanger bays. Paulo managed to break away from the group and found the corridor leading to his hanger strangely deserted. He guessed that most of his wing had either already been or were still behind him somewhere.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Paulo, we better get out there,&#8221; came a female voice from behind him. He turned to see Juanita standing there in a fresh pilot&#8217;s uniform. She sounded like she was trying not to be angry.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Fine,&#8221; replied Paulo. They would have to talk after the current crisis had been averted. They entered the hanger together.
<br />

<br />There you go. I promise to have the next one up sooner.</div>
