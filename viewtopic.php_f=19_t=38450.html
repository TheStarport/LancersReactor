			<div class="content">TEGID, the new wargame sweeping the Freelancer Community!
<br />
<br />Greetings from the captain and crew of the Pirate Ship Revenge, the DreadPirate_Roberts and The_Crow. Exactly which of the latter two is actually the captain is still under debate. 
<br />
<br />DP: Whilst traveling between systems an idea for a battle game for the Freelancer continuum was born in me mind and I ast me prime minister of strategy, aka The_Crow, to work out some o' the niggling little details. 
<br />
<br />The_Crow: Actually, the birth of the idea came from Orson Scott Card's book &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and the concept of &quot;the battleroom&quot;. Thanks Uncle Orson! In honor of the germ of the idea, we are calling the game &quot;the Enemy's Gate is Down&quot; or &quot;t.E.G.i.D&quot; for short. 
<br />
<br />Here is the concept and the justification for the game. So many battles and wars in the Freelancer continuum end up just being a blasting session with little strategy, no real objective other than to blow up someone and then do it again after they respawn. Enter the game of ...... 
<br />
<br />t.E.G.i.D 
<br />
<br />Here are the guidelines. 
<br />
<br />1) First, get two teams that are each friendly with separate opposing factions in a system. Do not group at this time. For example In the Bering System, one team friendly with Unioners and one friendly with Bounty Hunters. 
<br />
<br />2) Each team elects a single player to be their &quot;Fifth Column.&quot; 
<br />
<br />3) The fifth column players go to their own friendly base and (on public chat) negotiate missions for each team to defend and oppose. (Ideally destroy base missions in fairly close proximity to each other for starters) If teams are not even, an easy mission can be selected by the weaker team if agreed on. 
<br />
<br />4) Each team's fifth column player selects their mission and flies to the other team's home base (not the mission base) and escorts the opposing team to the base that they will defend (the mission base, they've got to know where it is don't they?). The fifth column player must come to the unfriendly base (not the mission base) drop out of cruise and then may return to cruise to go to the mission base. The opposing teams tag along (no shooting at this point.)If someone can't keep up, they will just have to catch up later. Battleships may be at a disadvantage here. 
<br />
<br />5) The two fifth column players must publicly keep a countdown of their distance from the mission so as to arrive simultaneously. They may have to detour somewhat to arrive at the same time. 
<br />
<br />6) Upon arriving at the mission base, the 5th column player MUST do a fly by. He THEN invites a member of his team from across the system at the other base. (preferably someone with a short name) The player he invites quickly invites the others (cascade to invite each other) so that everyone is on the mission together. (format for distance invite is: /invite playername 
<br />
<br />(Now we have the opposing teams gathered at the base they will be defending except for the 5th column team mate) 
<br />
<br />
<br />7) As soon as they are grouped, their first job is to (KILL THE 5TH COLUMN) 
<br />
<br />8 ) The 5th column's job is to survive and spy on their disposition of forces: will they send 1/2 their team? 3/4s? All of them in a blitz? Opposing teams want to know! 
<br />
<br />9) The game is won when the other team's base is destroyed. All team members of the winning team type in &quot;tegid&quot; immediately when base is destroyed or mission is accomplished. First team to legitimately enter the &quot;tegid&quot; is the winner. 
<br />
<br />a) Respawning is acceptable, but surviving is obviously better for time on game.. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Game features. There is really almost no way to cheat without it being observed and there is usually a clear winner. If none of the defenders are around to see their base blown up. They will have to take the opposing teams word for it, though they can always fly back and check. If it's important (as in a tournament), two referees can be chosen. Then the &quot;tegid&quot; is announced by the referee. 
<br />
<br />We are predicting a really huge good time to result from this game. Teamspeak and strategy will be crucial to be competitive as well as a good mix of ships and players. This could really revolutionize the Freelancer continuum as we know it. 
<br />
<br />Any bright ideas or wrinkles to iron out? You can reply on this forum, but please let us know you have at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:LVRE_2000@yahoo.com">LVRE_2000@yahoo.com</a><!-- e --> or just send the comment there if you'd rather. If I like the idea, I'll post it on the other forums too.

			<div class="content">Crow, welcome to the forums.  This post really belongs in the multiplayer section.  I was going to move it to Clan, but I think you'll get a better response in multiplayer.  Look for your post and the thread it makes there.  Thanks, Boscoe
<br />
<br />Crow, I tried to email you about moving this thread, but you didn't supply a real email address.  Please don't complain about this thread being moved since there's no way to contact you.
