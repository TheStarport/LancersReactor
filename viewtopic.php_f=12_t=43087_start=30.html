			<div class="content">take a look at a US dollar - it's loaded with Masonic symbols and imagery. The American Founding Fathers were mostly Freemasons, and Freemasonry played a huge role in the dissemination of ideas of independence and revolution in the Colonies. 
<br />
<br />Freemasons were almost certainly behind the murder of Roberto Calvi, *God's Banker,* under Blackfriars Bridge in Old London Town. The Bologna railway station bombing was carried out by right-wing terrorists with connections to the ultra-reactionary P2 Masonic Lodge. Freemasonry is still a powerful force in right-wing politics across Europe.
<br />
<br />the only connection between Freemasons and the Baphomet is that (some) Masons claim to be the spiritual descendants of the medieval Knights Templar, who were accused of worshipping Satan in the form of the Baphomet. But that's another story altogether...
<br />
<br />Masons do indeed worship (if you can call it that) *The Great Architect* (of the universe) which of course most folk take to mean *God* as He is popularly understood in the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. But actually, the GA isn't God at all, not the God of the monotheistic religions anyway. He's the Demiurge (a lesser emanation of the Supreme God, the One, the Ein-Sof of Jewish Kabbalah) and since the Demiurge is, by definition, imperfect, all he could create is this imperfect *reality* - and as such he is more akin to the role of Satan, who as you should know is *Lord of this World* But of course, quite distinct from Satan is that Demiurge can create, whereas Satan can create nothing.
<br />
<br />It's this equation of the role of the Demiurge with that of Satan (erroneously) that contributes towards the perception that Masons are closet satanists. As to the Baphomet, well it gets even more confusing.
<br />
<br />The Knights Templar were charged with the defence of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem from the armies of Islam during the Crusades. During their sojourn in the Holy land, the Templars became very wealthy and a political force in their own right due to their wealth and military prowess. Thus they began to treat with Muslim lords in their own right and not necessarily on the orders of their King, but more on that of their Grand Master. This meant that they became more closelt associated with the older and much more sophisticated Muslim culture, which to mem who'd known nothing better than draughty castles, dank wooden towns, and grimy peasant villages, must have been a revealtion. Remember that in Damascus at this time the streets were lit, there was proper drainage and night-time central heating. Muslim scholars had access to classical texts that Westerners beleived lost or were banned by the Church.
<br />
<br />This dalliance with Muslim cultiure began to make the templars suspect, and their wealth and power aroused the jealousy of European rulers and prelates, especially when the Holy Land was finally lost for good and the Templars continued to amass wealth through finance and trade. Eventually a plot was cooked up by the King of France and supported by the Pope to bring the Templars down. Amongst the many things they were accused of was worshipping a Satanic figure called the Baphomet, but what this actually seems to be is a confusion between Mahomet (Mohammed) in reference to their links with the Islamic world, and a bearded gargoyle that they seem to have used as part of their initiation ceremonies. if you bear in mind that at this period Islam was viewed in the West as the work of the Devil and Mohammed (pbuh) as the Antichrist, then it wasn't much of a conceptual leap to beleive that the Templars were worshipping some sort of Islamic demon.
<br />
<br />Where the connection to the Masons comes in, if you want to beleive it, is that on the night that the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques de Molay, was executed, a hay-wagon is supposed to have left for Scotland carrying the secrets of the templars and the surviving members of their inner circle, so that the Templars could be refounded as the Freemasons. There is no objective historical evidence for this at all. Now in many countries the Templars did survive, as not all rulers agreed with or obeyed the Edict by the Pope (but in actuality the work of the French King) to hand them over to the secular arm. In some countries they were token arrested then quickly let go, in others they weren't arrested at all but joined other orders such as the Teutonic Knights and the Knights Hospitaller, it was really only in France that they were made to suffer. Eventually even the Pope got embarassed and nervous about what was going on and offered the Templars a diplomatic escape route which they nobly refused. However after Jacques de Molay's death the persecution waned, as the King of France had got his hands on their gold and jewels and weapons and castles. With Louis' subsequent death shortly thereafter, all actions against the Templars ceased; as an order they ceased to exist but they were incorporated en masse into other orders in countries like Portugal where their wealth and knowledge may well have subsequently assisted men like Henry the Navigator and Vasco da Gama. Certainly their military abilities were well used by the Teutonic Knights in the conquest of the Baltic states.
<br />
<br />Are Masons Templars? many people like to think so, including many Masons, but sadly the story of the hay-wain is just that, a subsequent embellishing of a sorry tale of betrayal and tragedy. There's a nice story that when the last King of France was executed, someone in the crowd shouted, *Jacques de Molay, you are avenged!* but again, it's just a story - there's no contemporary corroboration. the story of the hay-wain doesn't get any mention whatsoever until the 17th century (iirc) when Freemasonry is already well established in Scotland and it completely lacks any details.
<br />
<br />There is also the view that in fact Masons are atheists and don't beleive in any religion at all, and that the vague Great Architect esotericism is just a mechanism to rid initiates of any lingering allegiances to traditional Christianity. However in Italy, and to a lesser extent France, Spain, and Portugal, there have been and still are close ties between ultra-reactionary Catholic organisations, Italian fascists, the Mafia, and right-wing Freemasons and their associates. The Vatican Bank was riddled with Masonic and Mafia connections right up to the top, hence why i mentioned Roberto Calvi earlier, head of Banco Ambrosiana in milan which was used by the Vatican for its foreign currency transactions and investements, and turned out to be using Vatican money to launder criminal funds and fund right-wing terrorism. Calvi's body was found under Blackfriars Bridge in London and upo investigation *appeared* to have killed according to Masonic ritual punishment for betrayal. However the Catholic Church still formally forbids any of its priests to be or continue to be Freemasons (Cardinal Ratzinger 1981)
<br />
<br />
<br />I persoanlly know several Masons and they're all upstanding respectable businessmen and members of the community, apart from one or two bighead coppers. In reality i think Masons are and can be all theses things - whilst the majority use it like any fraternal society for mutual assitance and work in the community, there is an esoteric element that appeals to the mystical and those with a fondness for secret societies. Particularly in the 19th C, many Victorian gentlemen were Masons and pursued interests in speculative history, the occult, spiritualism and theosophy. 
<br />
<br />Famously, Benjamin Franklin, talented man of many parts and spiritual father of the American Revolution, was Grand Master of the Pennsylvania Lodge (he also became US Ambassador to revolutionary France, where many of the bourgeois revolutionaries were themselves Freemasons) Both George Washington and John Hancock were active Masons. I think something like over a 1/3 of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were Freemasons, a much higher ratio than that of Masons to the general population anyway, and almost half of Washington's generals in the Continental Army were Freemasons. Now that is disproportionate! 
<br />
<br />Masonic symbolism abounds on the US currency, and the US Constitution's clear disestablismentary distinction between State and religion means that in the entire document you can find very little direct reference to God. What you actually get is phrases like *Creator* and *Nature's God* which everyone assumes is the same as the Christian God but actually isn't, it's the Demiurge, Creator of Matter as I've discussed above. The Masonic symbols of the Pyramid, dividers and the All-Seeing Eye on the dollar bill give the lie to that assumption - the Founding Fathers were actually referring to the Great Architect. The only direct reference I can find in American governmental symbolism is *In God We Trust*  - I always find it rather ironic when certain Americans claim that they live in a Christian country, when they actually don't! And this is one of the reasons why America is often referred to by its enemies as the Great Satan, because the God that the Founding Fathers refer to is a lesser being responsible only for our world of matter and its woes. 
<br />
<br />Incidentally Hitler and his Nazis hated Freemasons and there was a special section of the <i>SicherHeitsDienst </i> tasked with rounding them up. However since Freemasons weren't Jews they had the honour of building Himmler's mad <i>SS </i> castle, the <i>Wewelsburg </i> because they weren't racially polluted. 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />yes I know its bizarre stuff but it all checks out. I haven't made a single word of it up.

<br />Small point, perhaps.  Thomas Jefferson was a very ardent freemason.  He also is one, more than the others, who proposed &quot;Deism&quot; or a belief in &quot;a&quot; supreme being but not necessarily the elaborated Christian one.  Many equate Jefferson's deism and much of the symbology of the freemasons with Zoroastrian ideas.

They are sworn never to reveal what goes on behind the scenes. And, the 1st 3 degrees are not the hard core ones. Religion IS at the heart of it. As you progress in ranks, &quot;New&quot; secrets are revealed, like &quot;Lost&quot; names of God. They are not what they seem. Also, masons ARE tied in with mormons.

			<div class="content">CV, it's really not humbug. It's all well documented, the history and trials of the Templars particularly so. You'll note that I point out afterwards that I don't beleive that they actually have anything to do with Freemasonry. Also, the equation of the Great Architect with the Demiurge is well established if you care to read through any Gnostic texts or commentaries. As to the Founding Fathers of the US being made up of a large ratio of Freemasons, well again, very well documented, no real arguments against that. As to the connections between extreme right-wing groups and reactionary Freemasons in Europe, again there's no doubt about that, many judicial enquiries and investigations have established that such links do exist. As to the Masonic symbolism on the dollar bill, well here look for yourself...
<br />
<br /><img src='http://nipiap.free.fr/blog/images/Philadelphie/dollarMasonic.jpg   '>
<br />
<br />these are well-known and commonly used occult Freemasonry symbols that you see on Masonic regalia and in their Halls. As to whether there's anything sinsister about it? Who's to say? But it is Masonic imagery put on there by practising Freemasons who led the American Colonies to independence. That's just a piece of history - make of it what you will.
<br />
<br />it's well documented on the interweb although the wackier Right-wing anti-federal govt types use this as *proof* of a Satanic/Masonic plot to destroy Christianity. Apologies if you thought I was giving this impression, I'm certainly not! However those of us on the Left also make mistakes interpreting this imagery, Novus Ordo Seculorum  is often translated as *New World Order* which is incorrect, it actually means *New Order of the Ages.* Is there a difference? Yes, but you have to appreciate the mind set of educated men in the 18th C Age of Enlightment who thought they were ushering in a new age of prosperity and egalitarianism for mankind free of the medieval superstitions and practices of the Old Order (kings, established churches etc) New World Order is a modern (20th C) phrase and has meant different things to different people
<br />
<br />I actually don't beleive in any of those things you said, and I've railed against the plagiaristic nonsense that is the Da Vinci Code before now, debunked every Atlantis thread, I saw the Moon landings myself on telly when I was a kid, I've been to the Pyramids and they arent alien landing platforms, and I've been to Mt Ararat and there aint a UFO on it. But just cos I dont beleive in this nonsense doesn't mean they dont have power; things take on a life of their own if enough people beleive they are true, regardless if they are true or not. Many Freemasons choose to beleive that they are the descendants of the Knights Templar, even though they actually aren't. Thousands of Americans beleive they've been abducted by aliens (when the rest of us know it was their brains abducted by moonshine) 
<br />
<br />I'm well aware of the bonkers opinion that the world is actually run by lizard men from outer space or unknown masters or whatever. You didn't actually think I shared that opinion, did you? I don't think I ever gave that impression.... I do think there's a conspiracy (well, conspiracies actually) but they don't involve lizard men, aliens, or the occult, just greed and hatred. 
<br />
<br />As for contemporary cooroboration, don't be daft; I'm talking about eye-witness accounts, contemporary records etc, not digging people up, you silly fellow! You been taking Nickless pills?
<br />
<br />Ed - I can't mention everyone! Jefferson is included by default and yes I know he worked on the design of the dollar bill &lt;sheesh&gt; Anyway you know more about Masons than me, you almost Mason you, you should be telling people what goes on, not a humble Mullah like me who's main concern is the length of beards and that no female ankles are showing from neath their burquahs!  
<br />
<br />Zoroastrianism? yeh sort of, the dualism and the Supreme Godhead (Ormuzd) with lesser emanations and the moralism and philanthropy, but shoorly Gnosticism is more theosophically appropriate? After all, iirc, you don't get a Demiurge/Great Architect in Zoroastrianism? it's Ahura-Mazda/Mithra v. Shaytan/Ahriman fighting for the soul of man and the fate of the world as I recall. 
<br />
<br />Incidentally there's plenty of Gnostic and Masonic claptrap in the Matrix if anyone cares to look! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />All I said was that I once was invited to become a Mason.  This is true.  I was invited by one who has since passed away who was a mason and whose brother was the president of his lodge at the time.
<br />
<br />I politely declined, flattering as it may have been to be offered, basically because I am not into that secret society stuff and the rigors of initiation and ritual that go with it.
<br />
<br />The masons I know do not define their lives around their membership in their society but then again, not being an initiate, it is not as if they confide everything in me.
<br />
<br />And, as I remember it, Shriners have sillier hats than Masons ever did.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />&lt;Edit&gt;
<br />
<br />I suppose any grouping of people of influence is bound to suggest a hidden agenda or conspiracy.  The way in which freemasonry is injected into some theories of who really was Jack the Ripper, for example, is yet another case in point.
<br />
<br />I alwasy understood the origins of freemasons to be from the age of the great Gothic Cathedral building that went on in Europe.
<br />
<br />There was a time when a mason was an architect, at least the more skilled ones were.  They learned their craft through apprenticing and the income they earned was significant in that age ... especially for men of humble origins.  So it was natural to expect that they would be protective if not secretive of their ways.
<br />
<br />They were among the more influential guilds as I recall.  And guilds of that time were pretty much organized like secret societies except that they meant even more as they wielded both economic and political clout.

			<div class="content">well isn't that what they want you to think? there's a world of difference between the guilds of the High Gothic era and the gentrified bourgeois all-male clubs of the late 16th/early 17th Century, which is where Freemasonry as we recognise it today first appears. I think even then, one would have been hard pressed to find a genuine stonecutter amongst them.
<br />
<br />rather it was a combination of gentrification and mercantile wealth combined with an esoteric and mystical mania of the era, esp as regards Hermeticism and the occult knowledge of Trismegistus, the final flowering of alchemy as it were, that impelled wealthy philanthropists down this path. Through the Hermetic lore they fancied a direct connection to the mysticism of Kabbalah and the secrets of ancient Egypt, Hiram Abiff being Solomon's mason who built the Temple (supposedely) There was also some device thats mentioned in rabbinical lore which was harder than diamond or steel but cut stone silently, which apparently was also kept in the Temple with the Ark and all the other stuff (can't remember what it was called though) 
<br />
<br />ooo I didn't know all this though! - <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due' Target=_Blank>P2's Wiki</a> what a naughty bunch. See?</div>

			<div class="content">@Taw: Clearly you have much more confidence in humanity. Personally I reckon we're just too stupid to organise such a well run conspiracy. The biggest trick is not making people believe they <i>don't </i> esixt but quite the opposite, that of tricking folks into thinking that humans are capable of the level of agreement necessary to make it happen. Then again, if you can't make the leap of faith into the supernatural, and you can't face reality as it is, there is always the hope that a group of super elite freemasons have a firm grip on things.

			<div class="content">Freemasonry
<br />I  INTRODUCTION 
<br />
<br />Freemasonry, largest and most widely established fraternal order in the world. The masons' guilds were originally restricted to stonecutters, but with the completion of the building of the cathedrals in the 17th century, and especially in England during the Reformation, they admitted as members men of wealth or social status. The guilds thus became societies devoted to general ideals, such as fraternity, equality, and peace, and their meetings became social rather than business occasions. Four or more such guilds, called lodges, united in London on June 24, 1717, to form a grand lodge for London and Westminster, which, within six years, became the Grand Lodge of England. This body is the &#8220;mother&#8221; grand lodge of Freemasons in the world, and from it all recognized grand lodges have been derived. The Grand Lodge of All England was formed at York in 1725, that of Ireland at least by June of the same year, and of Scotland, in 1736. The York body came under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge at London later in the century.
<br />
<br />As a result of the patronage of the order by members of the nobility, the rising British mercantile class looked upon Freemasonry as an adjunct to social success, and the order became popular. The Masonic ideals of religious toleration and the basic equality of all people were in keeping with the growing spirit of liberalism during the 18th century. One of the basic tenets of the Masonic orders throughout the English-speaking world has been that religion is the concern solely of the individual. Opposition on the part of the Roman Catholic church has been chiefly on the grounds that Freemasonry, with its binding principles and religious nature, has usurped the prerogatives of the church. As a result, the Freemasons have never been permitted in some strictly Roman Catholic countries, such as Spain. In France, however, following the atheistic and Protestant trend of the French Revolution, the order flourished.
<br />
<br />II  FUNCTIONS 
<br />
<br />In most English-speaking countries, the charitable and protective features of the fraternity have been responsible for the establishment of Masonic homes for the care of dependent aged Masons and their widows and orphanages and schools for the children of members. The Mason is instructed that his fraternal obligations involving aid to members are to be subordinated to the duty he owes to God, his country, and his family, with full recognition of the duty he owes to humanity. The Masonic fraternity differs radically from the other private benevolent societies, and from the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the next largest private, international, fraternal association, in that the relief or charity extended among members is purely voluntary, dependent on the need in each individual case. It is in no way part of a contract or other understanding that the distress of a brother shall call for specific financial recognition or care. Freemasonry is essentially an educational society, attempting to teach its members a moral philosophy of life.
<br />
<br />III  FREEMASONS IN AMERICA 
<br />
<br />The earliest of the U.S. lodges, founded by authority of the Grand Lodge of England, were the First Lodge of Boston, established in 1733, and one in Philadelphia, established about the same time. By the time of the American Revolution, about 150 lodges existed in colonial America. American Freemasons today make up about three-fourths of the total number of all members throughout the world; world membership exceeds 6 million.
<br />
<br />IV  MAJOR SYSTEMS 
<br />
<br />Scores of Masonic rites have sprung up since the 17th century, but only five of any great consequence survive today. Two Masonic systems are called the York Rite and the Scottish Rite. Neither has any connection, historically or otherwise, with York, England, or Scotland. The York Rite was formed in the late 18th century and is called Capitular and the members Royal Arch Masons (4 degrees); the next step is Cryptic and the members Royal and Select Masons (3 degrees); and the final step is Chivalric and the members Knights Templar (3 orders).The Scottish Rite was formed in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1801 (33 degrees including three Symbolic Lodge Degrees).
<br />
<br />In many other groups, loosely attached in some way to the York Rite, members are usually selected but sometimes are elected. They are interested in special aspects of Masonry, including Masonic research. One might say they are offshoots of the main stem. Among them are the Royal Order of Scotland, the Allied Masonic Degrees, the Red Cross of Constantine, the Masonic Rosicrucian Society (SRICF), the Rite of Strict Observance (CBCS), the Grand College of Rites, Knight Masons, Order of Corks, the York Cross of Honour, the Blue Friars, and the Holy Royal Arch Knights Templar Priests. There are also what might be called &#8220;fun degrees,&#8221; such as the Shrine, the Grotto, and the Tall Cedars of Lebanon, many of which are of considerable size. In addition some very small groups cater to students of special aspects of the Craft.
<br />
<br />For other Mason-affiliated organizations, see Eastern Star, Order of the.
<br />
<br />V  OPPOSITION 
<br />
<br />Anti-Masonic sentiment occurred chiefly in two ways since the founding of the order. The first, religious, is the opposition of the Roman Catholic church, although Freemasonry does not bar Catholics and a great many belong to lodges in Latin America and the Philippines. The second is political. For about a decade following the abduction from Batavia, New York, in 1821, of William Morgan, a Freemason who had threatened to publish Masonic secrets and who was commonly thought to have been kidnapped by the Masons, a general outcry was that many Masonic lodges had to be abandoned throughout the eastern and middle states. In the northern states the Anti-Masonic Party was formed; for a few years it was practically the only opponent to the Democratic Party. In 1832 the Anti-Masonic Party nominated a lawyer, William Wirt, as its candidate for the presidency, but he was defeated by Andrew Jackson, who supported Masonry. Ironically, Wirt himself was a Mason. After that date the Freemasons encountered little political opposition in the U.S. or elsewhere, until the rise to power of the National Socialists in Germany in 1933. In that year Hitler charged the Masons with responsibility for various subversive activities, including all the incidents leading to World War I, and decreed the dissolution of all Masonic bodies in Germany.

			<div class="content">My grandfather was a freemason, but I guess my Dad was unworthy or something because it all ended there. I know that my old school had it's own lodge which isn't surprising considering it's a church of England grammar school that's over 400 years old. The Old-Olavians as they're known, contribute money to the school and fund a prize to the school captain each year. It was pretty creepy when I realised how much of an old boys network still existed. I could go on forever how dodgy some of that schools dealings were.</div>

I think not, quite the opposite in fact. why did I give you a contrary impression? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font> I may have picked you up wrong but the seeming fact that you believe that the Freemasons have been and still are organised and disciplined to a level where they have such power, influence and secrecy (at least at the higher level) throughout time and society implies that you have enough faith in its members, who are also members of the human race. Unless we are to believe that they are infact alien dopplegangers. I doubt that jealousy, incompetence, greed, down right stupidity and all of the usual traits which bring down governments and other human endeavours are lacking in the Freemasons. I do not doubt their existence nor do I doubt the possible stretch of their ideoligy, putting them into effect however...?</div>

			<div class="content">that's not faith in humanity, that's cynicism. I take it that you hold the view then that humans aren't actually clever or foresighted enough to plan and execute a vast global programme of conspiracy? Why on earth do you think that? 
<br />
<br />The Cathoilic Church operates on a global basis and has for centuries, it's an adoptive organisation so it can ensure the transmission of its ideas to the best of each generation, and it has vast accumulated wealth and secret knowledge that it uses to promote its programme and ensure its long term survival - these things are not in question. So if the Catholic Church can do it, why shouldn't other organisations/institutions?</div>

			<div class="content">Very true, I was conscious of the RC church being a retort, indeed it is not alone as most organised religions which are constructed in such a way as to convince its people that they are the chosen ones, that they must protect the order, they must carry on its work and ensure its future, favour fellow members in enterprise and society, are open to the same slur. The two things which such sects have as an advantage are religion and a legitimate front.
<br />
<br />The motivation for the Freemasons recruits is what, the succession of an elite sect of society? Avarice? Power? Its foot-soldiers join because they are promised positions of influence in their companies or local society, perhaps the odd promotion or a discount in a fellow masons store. I mean at grass roots level here but naturally the wheeling and dealing gets more high risk at the top. Okay these things are not absent (more like abundant) in Rome but its recruits, its bedrock, would follow a god blindly and without question Amen, the opium of the masses as it is well cited to be. I believe that you will get people to carry out just about any act you wish if you convince them that it is in the name of their god but the freemasons do not have the type of cement which would persuade a man to blow himself in an act of martyrdom.
<br />
<br />Nor do they have the advantage of a shop on every corner where you can <i>openly </i> recruit more sheep and generate funds without even having to promise those new recruits better promotions in corporations or favourable finane plans.
<br />
<br />I see how it could work, I see its motivation, I see its influences, I just don't see how you could get people to remain loyal and get it to run smoothly. Then again, my eye sight is not the best since all this space got under my lids.
<br />
<br />Of cuorse, slagging off religion and picking out particular ones to use as examples is not a TLR topic and something I have regretted doing elsehwere so I will drop it here before I ofend anybody, particularly those I consider to be friends.</div>
