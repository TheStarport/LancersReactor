			<div class="content">For folks experienced with this style of computer game, the space-trading sim, the idea of a SP campaign is almost secondary.  I was kind of annoyed there wasn't an option to just start flying and exploring (an option in Terminus - a game hardcores should experiment with but it has all the features and then some, if tragically none of the atmosphere, of Freelancer).
<br />
<br />I sat through the SP campaign, which wasn't bad if you like that sort of thing, so I could get into the exploration.  I could go into all the ways Freelancer needs to upgrade and overhaul gameplay* but I have to give Freelancer its due - if you're a patient fellow with even a glimmer of a sense of wonder you definitely get your money's worth.  
<br />
<br />Discovering trade routes, secret wormholes, odd wrecks, the details of the setting by associating with factions and hearing rumors, visiting visually and aurally exotic realms and occasionally getting inspired to plot a big heist (&quot;So, Planetform's base is selling Alien Organisms is it?  Now, how do I get it to 'X' without hitting opposition?  What factions do I need to get in good with?  Are there hidden wormholes I can use to avoid gates?&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> or wreak vengence against a particular faction (&quot;Bretonnia Go Home - You Poofters!  Molly's Rule Dublin!&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> is all good stuff.  
<br />
<br />It would be better stuff if one could actually affect something other than static relationships with the factions and money could be spent on something other than just better factional relations or the occasional new ship or weapon.  I'd like to be able to really disrupt an enemy's trade.  I'd also like to see a more balanced galaxy in which particular factions aren't always complete pushovers.  How Liberty manages to fend off its much more powerful (in ship classes) neighbors I'll never know.  
<br />
<br />Continuity and suspension of disbelief suffer as a result of power inflationary systems - like those in old school RPGs and in Freelancer.   Zero sum, balanced systems, are a much better way to go.  Sure, more money = better gear, to an extent, but there should always be a trade off.  Maybe that much better gear is also much less reliable, much more expensive and much more fragile.   There should always be a reason not to automatically upgrade because eventually you end up with what Freelancer has - one or two ship types with optimal loadouts that everyone will fly (if they're sane).  Good balancers are fuel and energy consumption as well as flight, target and stealth profiles.  Only energy is modelled in Freelancer and only half-heartedly at that.  You'll never really find yourself sweating over which weapon to pick up and put in which ship - the right answer is always 'get me the biggest gun I can afford/qualify for based on my level.'
<br />
<br />Okay, back to the good stuff.  I really like the idea of keeping track of NPCs.  Reminds me of my own flightsim habits of taking down diary notes when playing dynamic campaigns.  For all my issues with Freelancer's gameplay and the lack of vision therein, I can't fault it with a lack of visual and conceptual design.  At first it seemed, and to an extent still does, very derivative of settings I know from elsewhere - Fading Suns comes to mind with it's Earth culture derived noble houses, trading and specialist guilds, mysterious artifacts, jump gates, etc., and others have done it before as well.  Still, over time it really grew on me as I began to understand the nuances of both factions and economies.  Combined with the brilliantly realized visuals I found myself really drawn into everything.
<br />
<br />If I can keep myself entertained enough with exploration and unravelling the setting I might not notice how bored I'm getting of repetative, redundant and retreaded dogfights and missions.
<br />
<br />This does lead me into another issue with Freelancer.  Multiplayer.  If the only really meaty thing about this game, IMHO, is exploring the setting then why would I want to play Multiplayer?  I've tried it a few times and it tends to consist of folks telling me where the best trade routes are or occasionally running them with others (which tends to involve alot of waiting around to 'meet up').  I'll confess it was fun for a little while but I don't want people telling me all the secrets and I can dogfight just fine on my own.  If factions can't actually be employed as strategic proxies for player factions to war on each other, meaningfully, then what's there to keep players interested in MP?
<br />
<br />* (including balanced and player-skill oriented ship design and operation rather than power-levelling ship, more realistic AI behavior (morale, avoidance, and surrender) and better dogfighting skills (teamwork and employment of tactics/weaponry/systems), wingmen, dynamic economies, dynamic factional interrelations, more varied mission types for players and encountered NPCs - *especially* faction specific missions and rewards, more special locations and/or randomized special events/encounters etc...)
<br />
<br />
<br />Alright, longer than the original post but wanted to get it all in there.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">here i thought it was only me...
<br />
<br />i spent over 100 hours in FL before i even thought to look up a website, and i waded through about 2000 &quot;reviews&quot; before i actually hit this site, which is kewl btw.
<br />
<br />what did i do? Figured out most of the Faction ratings myself. Made huge charts of weapons, contrasted as to speed, type, range, etc. so i would know whether to dump those salvaged Dusters, hold em for sale or swap 'em out. Mapped everything. Poked around. Found stuff. Figured out my own cheapest trade routes. Smuggled Cardamine before i figured out that it isn't the highest profit ratio. Tried to blow up stations &lt;gyp!&gt; and planets &lt;no *sob*&gt;. Tried to get some monkeys to talk to me. Read every single news brief in every station and by every Faction. Listened to all their bar sob stories and figured out who was a corporate dupe and llama. Got the three uberships and experimented. Now i'm messing with mods.
<br />
<br />sure there are things that would push this game into a dedicated timeslot of its own &lt;every Sunday night, 9-12 PST&gt; which i wish it had. But going by the current state of affairs, 100 hours of play is at least not a total burn for $50 &lt;yes i buy games when they come out, to support the industry&gt; like perhaps two dozen titles i can name, just from the last year. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Keep it icy, man; I don't want to end up a corpse before my time because you were used to a joystick.&quot;</div>

			<div class="content">It would have been nice to have a clearer split between the game and the story, though: the story would make sense as an add-on, and would have leaved the basic game in much nicer shape. As it is, there seem to be too many 'can't do this until youve done mission X' things.
<br />
<br />Can't leave the New York system until after mission 2. The stated reason is that I don't have the access codes to the jump gates, but as even the jump holes are locked, it's something else that's the matter: the story obtrudes on the game.
<br />(Haven't checked yet if Rheinland is accessible after mission 2 -- it should be so according to game background, but I suspect the story decides differently.)
<br />
<br />Can't buy a Patriot until level 4, and can't reach level 4 until after mission 2. Yet levels in the game are based on property worth alone, as far as I can make out.</div>

<br />
<br />How refreshing it is to read an adult post that values the attributes of this game, unlike the...

<br />&quot;I have spent all the pocket money that my parents have given me, and I have not yet met Darth Vader! Why have I not met Darth Vader at Level 8?

<br />
<br />Respect to you Thorndog, for respecting how good this game actually is. I hope to meet you online one day as you sound like an OK dude.. just the type of guy that I could rely on to save my arse and be my wingman (Saving somebody elses arse, besides my own, what's does that mean?..

			<div class="content">Hi, i'm one of those &quot;Junior gamers&quot; you mentioned <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I have found freelancer a great game, Beyond anything i've seen in a game, When i first got it, I had no idea of what to do, or how the game worked, It really did feel like i was totally new to computers once more.
<br />
<br />Me being a fool, Have played Games like Elite Ages before my time, and the X-wing series..This is a brillant turn around of both of those games making Freelancer a totally revoultinside game..
<br />
<br />So far i haven't found a end too where the universe just can't go any further, I'm not even half way through the SP and i know theres lots more to go. I've spent about 12 hours playing and i just don't understand how the game is how it is without any limitations on what you can do.
<br />
<br />The only problem i have found with it is that i have a very bad trigger finger, I always seem to launch a missile into a friendlys base what suddenly seems too turn most people against me, More than once have i had too go back a few levels due to this. 
<br />
<br />But running trade routes is great, Atm i'm looking for a trade route what can get me a good 100k per route but i still haven't found one what comes too 20k..
<br />
<br />Btw - Thanks for calling people of my age thick, Not in those words but in the termogly..great..*Yes i can't spell sorry*</div>
