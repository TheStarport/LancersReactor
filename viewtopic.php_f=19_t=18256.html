			<div class="content">After browsing the forums and having a few bad experiences with multiplayer Freelancer, I have come to the conclusion that many of the people who frequent these areas are probably the most intolerant group I have ever seen towards new players.  I am not saying everyone is like this, but I have encountered several things that are just amazingly intolerant to me:
<br />
<br />1) Anytime ANYONE posts on a topic that has been answered before wether it was a few days or months ago is usually immediatly flamed for being a &quot;Newbie&quot; and failing to &quot;Properly search the forums&quot;.  I always thought that forums were used for asking a question then coming back later to see if there was an answer, not spending a half an hour searching for a remote topic that may have been covered 29 days in the past.  If you dont like it how about not reading it?  If you are another new player you might read it because YOU dont feel like searching for the answer either.  And if you are kind enough and know the answer you might answer it for fun or something.
<br />
<br />2) After trying to play Freelancer on some of the servers I had a few bad experiences:
<br />- I asked if anyone would be kind enough to give the basics on playing on a multiplayer server- I was immediatly booted from the server
<br />- I joined another and asked how people go about hitting targets when there is so much lag- I was wasted by someone even though you were not supposed to kill players in the new york system(I guess to prevent what happened to me)
<br />- Yet another server I joined someone asked if I needed help, I accepted gladly, 2 minutes later someone wasted the person who was helping me and said &quot;dont help the ****ing newbies.
<br />
<br />Now I have a few questions for multiplayer and I personally dont give a **** if they have been asked before because i dont feel like searching for 2 hours to find my answers, if you want to reply thank you if you dont than stop reading this:
<br />
<br />1) Is there no way to import your single player stats into multiplayer because it is awfully annoying having to start with practically nothing and play weeks on end to get somewhat powerful again
<br />2) Is is just my computer lagging or is hitting the target practically impossible because it jumps across the screen from the lag
<br />3) Are there servers that have more than a few player slots available? I mean it an awfully big universe to explore with only 32 people or whatever the servers usually hold, I thought there would be two or three main servers with hundreds of people on at a time
<br />4) If you do have to start from scratch on Multiplayer servers what is the fastest way to gain levels without some ass blowing you away as soon as you leave the designated no pvp kill zones?
<br />5) And lastly, Is there no way to use the same character on different servers?  It seems that it would be really annoying haveing to start from new every time you join a different server.
<br />
<br />Sorry if I seem a little agitated but it is annoying seeing so many intolerant people playing a great game like this, share your thoughts if you have something constructive to say and if it is something negative about this post keep it to yourself.</div>

<br />
<br />I flame if the topic is covered by a Sticky post, usually telling them to go look in that thread, if not I help if possible not like some of the idiots on this forum
<br />
<br />-
<br />
<br />1) Is there no way to import your single player stats into multiplayer because it is awfully annoying having to start with practically nothing and play weeks on end to get somewhat powerful again
<br />
<br />Nope, that's the way they made it got to live with it unless they decide to allow characters to be moved or some code makes a utility for admins to make it possible.
<br />
<br />2) Is is just my computer lagging or is hitting the target practically impossible because it jumps across the screen from the lag
<br />
<br />Just lag, usually down to people using mods in servers when they shouldn't or more likely just a crap server host unless your 56k.
<br />
<br />3) Are there servers that have more than a few player slots available? I mean it an awfully big universe to explore with only 32 people or whatever the servers usually hold, I thought there would be two or three main servers with hundreds of people on at a time
<br />
<br />32 atm is the limit or too much lag, max the game allows is 128 but that?s not possible
<br />
<br />
<br />4) If you do have to start from scratch on Multiplayer servers what is the fastest way to gain levels without some ass blowing you away as soon as you leave the designated no pvp kill zones?
<br />
<br />Team up, and learn the quick cash routes with little lane hacker or Hessian annoyance
<br />
<br />5) And lastly, is there no way to use the same character on different servers? It seems that it would be really annoying having to start from new every time you join a different server.
<br />
<br />Possible but means the admin finding the correct player data on his server, there <b>not   </b> nicely named but only useful atm if is a complete swap ie everyone on a server to another, but anyone on the moved too server will loose out. As I said until DA make it possible or someone makes an admin utility for this not possible with out hassle.

			<div class="content">Oh just admit it, Hawk, there's a bunch of assholes who play online and make that game ****ty for new players. 
<br />
<br />It's a very well known fact.
<br />
<br />Stop giving the noobs a hard time just because they're new. They need to learn the ropes and what better way to do that than by asking a question.

			<div class="content">There are a few servers where people are actually respectful (more or less) of new characters. I've had good experience on Alpha Centauri 2, DA Patch, Raptors Pure server, and a couple others.  I guess its kind of like prison. If someone picks a fight, fight back. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> One way to make quick money is to pirate the transports. Some servers handicap the amount of cargo dropped, but i know you can get a couple hundred cargo on DA Patch and Raptor.
<br />
<br />To answer the rest of your post:
<br />Those people play the game and talk like that in chat too. Just live with them. Welcome to Multiplayer <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<h3><a href="#p153384" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">1) Anytime ANYONE posts on a topic that has been answered before wether it was a few days or months ago is usually immediatly flamed for being a &quot;Newbie&quot; and failing to &quot;Properly search the forums&quot;. I always thought that forums were used for asking a question then coming back later to see if there was an answer, not spending a half an hour searching for a remote topic that may have been covered 29 days in the past. If you dont like it how about not reading it? If you are another new player you might read it because YOU dont feel like searching for the answer either. And if you are kind enough and know the answer you might answer it for fun or something.
<br />
<br />I flame if the topic is covered by a Sticky post, usually telling them to go look in that thread, if not I help if possible not like some of the idiots on this forum
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />well, from what i can tell, the main problem is faiure in the home life, single parents that do not have the proper amount of time to spend with thier children to teach them basic values, children with bad or oppressed homelives. Most of these types don't have the wazu to actually treat people like that in real life out of fear of an ass stomping-lol.  
<br />Also internet anonymativity (sp?) has a lot to do with is mixed with a big shot of arrogance, and a touch of wanting to show off.
<br />
<br />so there is the anwser to your not really asked question.</div>
