			<div class="content">Great post tachyon.
<br />first of all i would like to say that the moderators here do a great job, I've never seen a community that is this friendly and where the mods don't abuse their power. RESPECT to all of you!
<br />Second I would like to say that I have no problem with members from the X2-forum here, as long as they obey the rules we all have to follow, wich aren't that hard to follow. A little respect and not posting things that have been posted numerous times before, that can't be hard now.
<br />I've been on alot of forums and most of the time when a newbie comes and asks a question he is immediatly flamed (SH*T UP YOU F**KING NOOB and so on, some even go as far as saying all nOObs should be banned, this is really discusting) on this forum every newbie is given a good welcome and hardly any flaming happens here.
<br />And no i do not think that there should be a X2 thread here, just like there shouldn't be a freelancer thread on the X2 forum, that's why there are seperate forums. It would be like making a thread about tanks on a navy forum (no offence, just to give an example). 
<br />I admit that I hadn't heard about X2 untill a few weeks ago, I took a look at the site and have to admit it looks great, but freelancer is where my main attention goes to, since i have been following it for a couple of years, and have been eager to play it ever since i quit playing Starlancer (multiplayer kind of died at the zone <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) 
<br />anyways, never forget It's all about respect
<br />peace out</div>

<br />
<br />I think it's fine to have X2 fans come here and ask questions about FL, just to compare it with their game. If they want to use the info given to them for a report on their forum, fine !! As long as they do it respectfully towards TLR and Freelancer. It's all about their behavior on the TLR forum and their tone of voice so to speak. If they are respectfully comparing FL with X2 and then cast their opinion in a fashionable manner, than nobody is complaining about it, but if they deliberately slate Freelancer (without even have played it), clearly advertise for X2, troll or insult TLR members, then I truly believe they gave our moderators a legitimate reason for closing those threads. I do believe that there are only a few harcore X2 fans with this attitude, but that they possibly influence other X2 forum members to act the same. Anyway, whatever their reasons are, they should respect the TLR rules and if they comply with those rules, then they are most welcome to this site as is anyone else. We all have to grow to maturity, so why don't we begin with that starting right now ? I believe that we can truly coexist, but the coin has two sides ! Remember that.
<br />
<br />I'm a little objective about 'moderating'. I agree with Tach that some threads are closed a little bit premature, but on the other hand, we can't always hear their drive for closing the threads. Perhaps it would be an idea to give a little bit more openness about the closing of certain threads ? The general idea is to give the TLR members some more involvement and perhaps even generate understanding for the closing and the path that the moderators follow/walk.
<br />
<br />About the community in general I can be brief. IMO a better community starts with ourselves !! As long as we continually judge ourselves and look at ourselves critically about how we react to certain occurences and remain true to the things that makes us friendly and helpful , then we will flourish in a tremendous way. With occurences I mean like (for instance) how we react to newcomers or the way that we defend our beloved game(s). I have cought myself several times being a little bit too fanatically defensive when it comes to Freelancer or other things for that matter. I always look back with some form of criticism if the situation requires to do so and draw my conclusions about the way I reacted. This helps me to react in a better and more friendly and objective way the next time. This is all part of the growing to maturity process. If we can all focus a little bit on this, it can only do good for the community.

			<div class="content">I have not got much time to post at the moment as I'm supposed to be at work <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />so I can't really comment much on your opinions.
<br />
<br />Let me be the first to say that the posts made here by members of &quot;MY&quot; community are out of order
<br />
<br />Unfortunatly, you have been chosen by some of the biggest spammers we have <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> as a point of amusement for childish and damaging posts.
<br />
<br />If you take a look at our end you will see that the majority of the long standing members of our x-community are coming down hard on these idiots
<br />
<br />Trolling and windups are not tolerated by us so I find it hard to see why certain members on my side of the universe find it acceptable here for the simple reaon that some of your members here are also posters on our side.
<br />
<br />Their grievances with your rules are being used on our side to inflame what is already becoming a tense situation between us.
<br />
<br />May I be the first to offer my apologies for this and say that there is no need for aggrivation between us.
<br />
<br />The last thing I would like to see is an inter-forum flame war
<br />( even though we'd win <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )
<br />

			<div class="content">Yes, i do agree on the post closing thing.
<br />
<br />Honestly tho, some of the posts i close are redundant.  Sometimes its just one simple question which was answered.  End of discussion so i close it simply cuz i saw no further development in the thread.  Forums are meant to have discussions last time i checked.
<br />
<br />But I will speak with Bargib and the rest of the TLR staff about this.  Besides, if you guys had mentioned something about premature post closing on the Site Suggestions thread, we woulda fixed this long ago.
<br />
<br />Cheers on the post, Tach.
<br />
<br />I have been reading the X2 forums and they do have a very nice and large community set up there.  It is only those select few (cough...snowy...cough) that are causing trouble.  Personally, i think they should grow up.
<br />
<br />----------------------
<br />EDIT
<br />Lord Vader, that is completely understandable since we have had our bad apples.  Thank you.  Its great that some of your forum members have been visiting our site but we just frown at the fact that they advertise and troll like they have done in the past few weeks.
<br />
<br />I certainly hope both our communities and games can get along.  I do certainly intend to buy X2 when it comes out. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I can only apologise for the actions of some of our members who have been disrupting this forum. As has been stated, the Egosoft forum is a little more free-wheeling than here, mainly because we don't have a separate off-topic forum--everything gets thrown into the mill. Therefore these people reacted with indignation at having their posts locked. THIS DOES NOT EXCUSE THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN ANY WAY, HOWEVER.
<br />
<br />Speaking personally, senseless Microsoft bashing is something which gets on my wick, and I think most of the antagonism has been down to that, pure and simple. I have every intention of giving Freelancer a go when it comes out; the real crunch test will be how long it holds my attention compared to X2, and I'm making no judgements on that until I've played both games.

			<div class="content">I have been following this forum for the past few days and I have noticed quite a nice community. Only within the last month have I taken considerable interest in FreeLancer. I even signed up for the contest that the main website had. You all seem like very intelligent, well-mannered people. Something that a great deal of communities lack these days. The FreeSpace2 forum was the last one I was involved in. It saw alot of bad days with people flaming each other. I have no idea what X2 is about. I did take the liberty of checking out their forum and noticed plenty of anti-FreeLancer sentiment amongst them. I haven't seen that much self-created hostility since the StarCraft/WarCraft fans swore up and down that Command &amp; Conquer sucks. I hope that I can provide everyone with my own unique insight as I'm sure you will all do the same for me.

			<div class="content">I'm willing to give X2 a go aswell, only problem is my budget won't really allow it. It looks like a great game and i'm also excited about it. But the main thing that gets me all excited about freelancer is the concept, if the game is as good as i want it to be, nothing will get me away from my computer.
<br />I would also like to give everybody that comes here and is allready a poster on the X2 boards a good welcome. Just read the forum rules, live up to them and you'll do just fine here.

			<h3><a href="#p72906" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">this is my first post over here (yeah I'm a X guy too) but I have been following this forum for a little while now.  I've not had a chance to read the entire post (as I'm at work) but wanted to post a little reply now.
<br />
<br />Firstly I'd like to second Lord Vaders (LV) post and say that the forum over there is very similar to here.  There are lots of folk who simply want to play space sims and hang about with like minded people, but unfortunately there are also some other (who are seriously in the minority) who thinks its fun to invade other peoples forums and start causing grief.
<br />
<br />There are a couple of threads on the X forum relating to here but the majority of the posts within them are friendly.  Some of them are supposedly jokes but badly worded and hence appear more like flames.   There are some complaints about the way this forum is moderated but IMHO this is mainly due to the vey relaxed rules that Egosoft have about posts on their forum and people dont seem willing to accept that other forums can be run differently.
<br />
<br />As far as I'm concerned, we're all here (and there) to wait for space sims to be released.  The games we follow are fundamentally different while stile being within the same genre.  I dont think that FL will be as much to my liking as X2 BUT (and its a big one) I'm going to wait until I've played them both before coming to any conclusion.</div>

			<div class="content">I've just got back home recently from working a 12hr day (4hrs overtime)... and my thoughts on this topic are quite simple.
<br />
<br />Now, I'm not trying to insult anyone with this... but I believe in a lot of cases, that simplicity is an ally...
<br />
<br /><b>Aren't there more important things to worry about in life?  </b>
<br />
<br />When I get here at the end of a day, and I see some topics locked... I just think... &quot;yep yep yep... that ones been going a while or&quot;... &quot;yeah that was going to keep going about nothing in particular...&quot;
<br />
<br />It's not a worry, I have a nosey... see what was said... then move on, no drama. If I had a problem or something wasn't answered, I go and ask it in a new post (if someone doesn't beat me to it! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).
<br />
<br />It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that anyone is welcome here, these topics that start with &quot;please don't flame me but...&quot; *whimper*.... I don't understand???  If any visitor would simply view a few posts in random, take a gander at the standard rules of most forums, I fail to see how anyone would think from &quot;Welcome to TLR *name here*! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>, feel free to ask away, I'm sure someone can help you... <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>&quot; that they will have to say &quot;please don't...&quot; etc etc...  In fact I wonder how many of those are started by misaligned individuals who simply want this kind of &quot;war of words&quot; we're having now!.
<br />
<br />Surely we can all just look at the locked posts... see where it was going a bit strange, then start a new one with a renewed purpose and direction of discussion, without accusing the Mods and Owner of being the reincarnation of  hitlers minions.
<br />
<br />It's simply not true, and matter of factly, it's pointless... surely we should simply be discussing intelligently and with pride, our own thoughts and opinions about questions we wish to find answers too... or answer for others (even if we're trying to convince them OUR games better than theirs <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> j/k ).
<br />
<br />Then we ourselves, and our fellow posters can make up our own minds about the games ultimately, while remaining civilized, courteous and honourable on either of our hallowed forums.
<br />
<br />Our hobby is gaming, and discussing the games we play (OR WANT TO PLAY... aaarrggghhh <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>... it's not differcult... in fact... it's simple.
<br />

<br />
<br />i'm part of the X2 community
<br />
<br />firstly though, freelancer looks a pukka game, and i will probably buy it along with X2
<br />
<br />as for the &quot;Trolling&quot;, there are only a minority of X2 users doing this, it would be nice if you dont blame the X2 community in general since no one organised trolling and no one will. The morons from our side are alone and they arnt gaining any friends by trolling you guys.
<br />
<br />if you feel the need to flame any X fans then do it here on the forums:

<br />Grimm purposely tells us on the X2 forums to take our quarrels there and not spam the official boards
<br />
