			<div class="content">Okay, MODlancers.
<br />
<br />Believe it or not, I finished (errrhm, well, more or less ^_^&quot<img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> my very first ever model, but now, I am stuck. Just about now, I realized that I just haven't the knowledge how to make *good* textures. I mean, I could just paint it black and start calling it K.I.T.T. , but somehow, I don't really like that idea. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />So, can anybody of you point me in the direction of a tutorial or something like it that tell's a freaking bloody newcomer like me (Adobe Paint WHAT? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_blush.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) how to work out textures in an acceptable manner? 
<br />
<br />Any help on this topic is welcome... no, really. 
<br />
<br />Well, take care.

			<div class="content">Heh.  You don't even know wat you're getting into.  Modeling and skinning are artistic, creative processes that require both expensive software (which you probably stole) a great computer, and skill.  But generically, this is how it goes:
<br />
<br />1. Idea
<br /> - If you don't have one of these, you're kinda screwed.
<br />2. Sketches
<br /> - It doesn't matter how bad you are at drawing, just get the idea in some kind of solid form.  &quot;Free modeling&quot; without a sketch or layout can have good results, but they will never be the results you originally intended.
<br />3. Model
<br /> - No, I'm not going to teach you how to model.  Pick up a copy of Maya PLE (the free one at Alias/Wavefront's website aw.sgi.com) for your OS, read some tutorials, and model away.  (Another solution is Milkshape3D.  It's free, but it has the worst interface of any software ever.)
<br />4. UV Layout
<br /> - Your modeling package should support UV layout.  This will help you stick all your textures to the model.  DO NOT skip this.  Stretchy, nasty textures make you look like a fool.  Your ship will look like it was painted in crayon, and girls won't talk to you.  So for god's sake, lay out your UVs.  Your 3D package's help file is more valuable than gold at this point.
<br />5. Painting
<br /> - You can either paint your textures in 3D with DeepPaint 3D (like $4000, I think) or you can paint them in Photoshop (less than $1000).  The difference is that DeepPaint 3D will allow you to paint on the model, and photoshop just paints flat files (bitmaps) with or without separate layers.  Then you attach the files created from either program to your model with your 3D package.
<br />6. Conversion
<br /> - Use whatever tools are required to convert your model/textures from your 3D program's file format to a format readable by Freelancer (or whatever game)
<br />
<br />Viola!  Done.
<br />
<br />Yes, there's a lot more to it than that.  3D modeling isn't something you just do on a lark, but is an art.  If you're willing to learn all those steps, cool, we need more texture artists.  If not, just delete your 3D pacakge.  It's just silly to have it when you don't know how to use it.</div>

<br />I didn't say that I actually had any of the needed software, did I ? Now, next time you hurl around accusations, be sure that they are appropriate. Here, they are not....
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>a great computer, and skill.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />I neither have expensive software nor a great machine, and skill... well, skill develops through training. Does that mean in your book I should just give up now and go hide somewhere?

<br />Check. I do my sketches in my imagination, or use references from existing pictures, like Animes.

<br />I'll have a look at Maya, although I do have a done model already (I mentioned this in the initial posting), made in Milkshape. All that's missing are the dummy triangles for the hardpoints.

<br />  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />It''s not the modelling, it's the painting of *good* textures that is a hinderance to me currently.... and yes, if I cannot get it done, I'll delete it of course. Why should I keep it anyways if I am incapable of using it?
<br />
<br />Thank you for your reply. Some other points of view on this topic would be nice, though.
