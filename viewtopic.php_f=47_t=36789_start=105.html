Your &quot;cause&quot; is stagnant, growth comes only from reproduction and the odd foreign fanatic. The average Rheinlander wants only to live his life in peace and comfort, not to die on a fools crusade to sweep a megalomaniac into power. No. The people of Rheinland have seen too many of those sitting in the Chancellor's chair. You have not seen an increase in numbers because they see the truth about you. You   are the one who is no better than the previous Chancellors, not I.   <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />I think I know what you would say. You'd say the answer to why our numbers are so small--they aren't, however, interestingly enough--is because you have been spreading propaganda and lies about us and all our allies so long that now you yourselves believe those same lies. We are not pirates, we are not neo-marxists, we are freedom fighters and socialist revolutionaries.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>You accuse me of spouting propaganda for so long that I believe it when you are the one who is blinded by hatred. The Hessian population is only a tiny fraction of the population of greater Rheinland. While the Hessian Armed Forces make up the largest percentage of your population (and don't bother to argue that point, we both know that unless you can pull resources out of thin air you need as many people as you possibly can have to steal that which you need to eke out your pathetic excuses for lives), only a fraction of a percent of Rheinland citizens volunteer for military duty. 
<br />
<br />As for the pirates whom you so romantically refer to as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, they are mostly no more than petty criminals, sociopaths and general reprobates. Do not delude yourself into thinking that they believe your so-called &quot;socialist&quot; yammerings. They have joined your cause that they may sow the seeds of destruction under a veil of semi-legitimacy. It is that simple. Your faction may once have had noble, even admirable goals but it is now an empty shell of its former self. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

			<div class="content">FROM DSE COMMANDER CAPTAIN KILL2
<br />TO CHANCELLOR CODENAME, COMMANDER HERR VAN HAALEIN
<br />ENCRYPTION TYPE: AIF-69
<br />CONFIDENTIAL FILES
<br />==MESSAGE BEGINS==
<br />
<br />Chancellor Codename, Commander Wilde, I have a proposal. This may sound greedy, however. Wilde, you say that Republican and Kruger have been harshly cruel. Chancellor Codename, you want the hostilities to end. I suggest that control of Republican and Kruger fall to a faction which is NOT cruel. For example, if Republican was to have control given to DSE, then all the harsh cruelty would end INSTANTLY. I may sound greedy, but any wars are likely to have repercussions to all the other Houses and Corporations. I make this proposal only to stop the constant and avoidable hostility between Rheinland and the Red Hessians-Bundeschu. If you disagree, then I shall leave you to your hostilities and the eventual all-out war that will come.

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>So you &quot;know better&quot;, do you? In reality you are only lying to yourself and others. The only decrease in population Rheinland has suffered was a result of mass emigration after the Nomad Incident. Look at the immigration/emigration numbers of the other Houses and you will see that what I say is true.
<br />
<br />You accuse me of working against you? I have never done any such thing. When I was installed no Hessian ever contacted me to negotiate terms of peace, no Hessian ever offered to lay down their arms. No, you just kept up your incessant murderous rampages through Rheinland space. When I was working so hard to rebuild our fallen nation did any Hessian offer support? No. But the citizens of Rheinland did. I am forever in their debt. Finally, yesterday you issued me an ultimatum. You must think pretty highly of yourself if you can feel that you have a right to be such an outright hypocrite.
<br />
<br />Finally, you have absolutely no right to claim to bear the mantle of the &quot;underpaid and overworked proletarian&quot;. You have never done a proper day's work in your life. You have never even set foot in one of the factories you so despise. You have been too busy murdering true Rheinlanders to do that. I am not sure which offends me more, your arrogance or your ignorance.     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />To Captain Kill2, DSE Chairman:
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Thank you for offering to be a truly neutral intercessor. I appreciate your efforts but I cannot help but fear that they will be in vain. I have already attampted such a solution and I was snubbed. Perhaps you will be more successful. One can only hope.     <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

<br />(OOC: Are we really going to keep this up for three days? Not that I mind, of course. I'm really enjoying this. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)

<br />Edit:
<br />&quot;I have no problem with that proposal. Rhineland might, however.&quot;

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>You truly are mad. Explain this, if you can. Why is it that when I offered the exact same deal - plus 90 credits - to the <i>Bundschuh,  </i>a fellow <i>revolutionary  </i>organization, you counselled them to refuse but now that DSE, another <i>corporation  </i>has made the same offer <i>in the interests only of improving its own business,  </i>is it suddenly okay?  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

			<div class="content"><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>Babbling on about some sort of &quot;Proletarian Revolution&quot; and making unreasonable demands do not make you their speaker. I think that if you were to stop and investigate the claims you toss about like so many Rheinlander lives you would see that people no longer really care. Those who join you out of anger at the corporations have personal vendettas, they do not reflect the attitudes of most.
<br />
<br />Also, did you ever stop and think that perhaps you are doing more harm than good? You attack the covoys sent out by the corporations, give those on board a chance to surrender, kill those who don't and steal their cargo. The corporations, being ever profit motivated must make up for the loss of personnel, equipment and source of revenue. The easiest way to do this is to pay the workers less for greater labour. If you truly cared about the Rheinland people then you would stop, for their sake. <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font></div>

If I was merely writing petitions agianst the companies, you would not even grant me an audience. In truth, the majority of Rhineland's population you will find agrees with at the very least our motives, if not our actions. Furthermore, what is the point of an organization like ours? To, through strength of arms, show the corporations we attack that as long as they continue oppressing the common worker they are not safe. If they violate freedom and override rights, we respond in force. Why? because people have learned a lesson in the past--protests and civil disobedience do not work when a company is only concerned with profit. Only strength of arms will work.

			<div class="content">good point. Hessian approval of the DSE plan denied. frankly, I want a war here. Could we get a removal of the grace period? I'm tired of defending myself and counter-attacking.
<br />
<br />Edit: I phrased that badly. I withdraw approval because Rhineland refuses to give its thus my support is worth nothing.

			<div class="content">TO CHANCELLOR CODENAME AND COMMANDER HERR VAN HAALEIN
<br />FROM COMMANDER CAPTAIN KILL2 OF DSE
<br />ENCRYPTION TYPE AIF-73
<br />CONFIDENTIAL
<br />==MESSAGE BEGINS==
<br />
<br />Chancellor Codename, Commander Herr van Haalein, you have actually amused me. You think I made that offer to INCREASE my profits? I would offer one quarter of the credits gained from the Republican Bases to both factions EACH. I merely wanted a war averted as it has long lasting repercussions AND I wanted to stop the cruelty to Rheinlanders by Republican and Kruger. I admit that I am low on commodities, but I have been trying to get a trade agreement for oxygen and water even while I thought you had both agreed. Now I see that your bloodthirsty intentions cannot be stopped. I offered peace, but instead you wanted war. I shall not stand in your way. But I do hope you don't make this war spill into other Houses because some of them are not as bloodthirsty as Rheinland and the Red Hessians. Also, I find that I am now questioning the Red Hessian and Bundeschu motives. I offered the chance to do what you have been endeavouring to do, and you threw it away. If you reconsider, then I shall be gladdened. If not, I shall leave you to tear each other's throats out.
<br />
