			<div class="content">I know how this sounds but it is the only exp that I can come up with It seemes that the harder u work 2 bring a good stable server 2 the peeps the more others want 2 destroy it.
<br />our oregon/usa TnG server all of a sudden seemes to have devolped a severe case of server cra****es and the funny thing is it usuall only happens when it is full and that was the norm been running with 18 -24 players up until a few days ago when the dreaded server flue struck .
<br />I have heard that I am not the only server OP 2 have had this prob but there r very few TnG servers that have any populations at all  and it is very distressing that this is the way some get their jollies and or players 2 either come back or 2 play on their servers
<br />Now it seemes that I will be forced 2 do a server wipe and make the server PW protected so that the legit players can enjoy FL with out the boorish actions of the few and we will probually have 2 bann the BattleShips to keep the server up
<br />There r nearly 1200 player accounts all of them active on the server that will b affected I and my admins &amp; sp dont know what else 2 do 
<br />if any of u have any Ideas that can help I am all 4 them 
<br />
<br />Have A Great Day</div>

			<div class="content">Have you checked out all coincidences from all crashes?  If you are using FLSO you could see if a certain player's name is always logged on during the crashes.  Have you looked at the Event Viewer?  Windoze OS's have a program called Event Viewer and under Application it is possible to view reasons (however obtuse they may be) for flserver to crash.  Was any other untoward activity happening at the time that seems to always happen during a crash?  Maybe lots of players logged in, lots of players in one system, firewall messages about lots of ping or other attempts, too much traffic for the amount of players online, too much CPU utilization for the amount of players online, etc.  What kind of crash is it?  Is it something FLSO recovers from or is it a lockup?
<br />
<br />I ask because I have on average one Event ID 1000 crash a day and a lockup a week but have never found any definitive explaination.  The crash can be recovered from by FLSO but not the lockup.  I have yet to see any mention by anyone on these issues but fortunately they are not enough of an annoyance to rise above my player's level of tolerance. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Yet. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sleepy.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">well as far as I can figure it is caused buy a knowen glitch in the TnG mod 
<br />the battleships will crash the server if u use nanos during battle this is a well known bug 
<br />the cpu &amp; latency were fine during play we set our player limet 2 20 even though the server can handle more we just felt that 20 was a good manageable amount and the cpu is usually running at 65-70 % 
<br />There was no prob 4 the first 6 weeks or so as the server began 2 fill up and full it was foe a bout 3 weeks or so then  we started having probs the FLadmin was shutting the server down about every 10 min or so untill the players left then it would b fine untill it got full again then it would start all over.
<br />we run the ironcross mark 3 and the server crashes were not showing up in the iso logs like they do on my RB server
<br /> all the crashes were in FLadmin 
<br />I turned it off and the server seemed 2 be ok then bam we got about 18 players in and it started again
<br />i took the box in and had darkmatter at the diskspace (a computer store ) he ran some tests and all was ok he then put it on his t1 line and things were fine 4 about 6 hrs there were about 8 players on 
<br />once the server got up 2 about 14 or so then the crashing prob started 
<br />he sayes that some body was doing it on purpose and there was little we could do about it
<br />
<br />What about the bonus !!!! oh juni</div>
