<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=246' Target=_Blank> <b>FFTurret (FLMM) made by Reggie Stein </b> </a>
<br />These files allow the turrets to fire forward on the following ships:
<br />Falcon
<br />Eagle
<br />Valkyrie
<br />Titan
<br />Hammerhead
<br />I either moved the turret to a new location and/or allowed it to fire 360 degrees. The Saber works out of the box. The Falcon worked but the turret was mounted upside down. There may be other ships with turrets that only fire backwards but the AI likes to ping at you with the turret as you chase it. The one gun just is not enough to save it from your pursuit. 
<br />Very heavy fighters should have 7 forward firing guns and heavy fighters 6.
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=242' Target=_Blank> <b>Engine Weapon Mod made by Alex Schultz </b> </a>
<br />The name of the mod is &quot;Money Engine Gun Mod&quot;. I got lazy. This mod changes the Justice Mk II's to a very strong gun that uses no energy to fire at its 500 refire rate. Each shot does 50 damage and i made them look at least i think, a lot cooler. The Justice Mk II also only costs $5 to buy. I also now changed the price of the Justice Mk I to $999999999, so now at the beginning of the game you can sell each of your Justices for allot of cash. This mod also changes the Eraser Missiles to do 652 damage with each missile and you don't need ammo anymore to fire it. You'll still receive 10 Eraser Missiles when you buy the Eraser Launcher, I modded the cost of the erasers so that you can sell them each for 250,000 credits when you get them, leaving you with a cool 2.5 million, the Eraser Launcher actually only costs 5 bucks to buy also. I also changed the look of the eraser missiles, they should look like particle guns when you fire them, you can also fire out 5 missiles per second. This mod should have changed the Engines too, The Engines should now only take 1 second to enter cruise speed and the thrusters should be almost endless. To activate the mods just open up the data folder (It should be C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Freelancer\DATA\equipment) and copy and paste the files in there. HAVE FUN!!</div>

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=214' Target=_Blank> <b>Simple Mod Version 1a and 3 made by Glock36 </b> </a>
<br />The Zip file Simple1a3a.zip contains two folders:
<br />1a and 3
<br />Individual installation instructions are contained in each folder.
<br />Thanks to everyone who sent feedback and suggestions. Version 1a and 3 are the result. Graphics bugs were corrected in Version 1 for those who preferred Version 1 to Version 2
<br />HERE IS WHAT IT DOES:
<br />On Planet Manhattan in the New York System:
<br />You will see a &quot;showcase&quot; of ALL mountable weapons and equipment available in the game. Planet Manhattan is where you end up after finishing the missions. You must have the appropriate ship and be at the appropriate level in order to purchase these items. After finishing the missions, you will not be at the required level but this &quot;showcase&quot; will allow you to see what's out there.
<br />On Planet Crete in the Omicron Gamma System and on Planet Malta in the Omicron Alpha system:
<br />You will be able to purchase all mountable weapons of Class 8 or greater and ammo for all weapons regardless of class. Included are the Nomad weapons, all the Special weapons, all class 10 shields, and even a couple of weapons the designers declared but forgot to use! Again, you must have the appropriate ship and be at the appropriate level in order to purchase these items. I selected these bases because they are the most difficult to get to.
<br />In Version 1a:
<br />The only difference between Version 1 and Version 1a is that graphics problems with Nomad weapons have been corrected. All weapons now display properly when mounted on a ship. No changes have been made to any weapons.
<br />In Version 3:
<br />Graphics problems with Nomad weapons have been corrected. Some Nomad weapons have been re-tweaked again for performance. The Nomad Cruise Disruptor is available and working now. The Cannonball missile has been tweaked for performance. Firing Graphics have been changed to reflect re-tweaking of weapons. You can really cheat now if you just enjoy blowing things up!
<br />UPDATE: The zip file has been updated now and the mod should now work correctly!</div>

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=211' Target=_Blank> <b>Anubis Faction Scheme Mod made by Laguna Fox </b> </a>
<br />Nomads laughing at your ship?
<br />Liberty Navy yelling at you for copyright infringement?
<br />Still not impressing Juni with your less-than-impressive paint job?
<br />Have the feeling that Orillian gave you the worst Anubis he could find?
<br />Suspicious that the Order has been lying about how advanced their technology is?
<br />Then this Mod is for you!
<br />Now you can make your Anubis look as sharp as it's name deserves with these new Factional schemes! Included within, you'll find:
<br />* Bretonian Scheme
<br />For when you need to force some British-feeling imperialism down the tail-pipe of the Rogues. Or when you feel the urge to teach the Molly's who the *real* terrorist is!
<br />* Corsair Scheme
<br />For when you're feeling all bad-ass about things, and want to go wreak havoc in style! Not to mention displaying those blood-red markings, and that crimson-skull! Red Dragons? Pfft. More like pink...
<br />* Rogue Scheme
<br />Ahoy! It's a pirate's life for you! Give your Anubis this scheme, and you'll be teaching all those criminals a thing or two about what REAL piracy is! Paint Job comes complete with mainstream criminal-tan, Buccaneer side-art, and skull and cross-scimitars upon the wings. Arrrnubis!
<br />* Anubis Scheme (requested)
<br />Make the Anubis remind you of Anubis with this ancient-feeling (if not slightly race-fighter) black and gold color scheme. Trimmings include side-art of Anubis, and Ankh panel-art.
<br />Simply take a look at the various beauty shots provided in each Faction folder, and pick the one that you like the most. Then copy the cv_ships.mat file from that folder into your Freelancer/Data/Ships/Order/ folder and voila! Your CTE range vessel has gone from boring liberty-defender rip-off, to nifty mean-looking Faction colors!

<br />The zip file contains two similar mods but both have a different focus. The OMI mod installs the mod with you as the &quot;good&quot; guy and the DEATH mod installs the mod with you as the &quot;bad&quot; guy.
<br />Changes =

<br />2. Crossed up the hole universe into easy acc for all so that a player that loves to trade can make allot of money an don't have to work his azz off.

<br />This mod opens all the jumpgates and holes for the SP campaign from the start. The newer version by request re-opens several gates and holes that get closed after the campaign is over. Just reload a game before the last mission to take affect, or simply start a new game. See readme.txt for more info.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=202' Target=_Blank> <b>Civilian House Scheme Mod made by Laguna Fox </b> </a>
<br />Sick of your Falcon resembling an Origami model?
<br />Tired of your Eagle looking like it's been covered in cardboard?
<br />Want something that makes your Hawk look as mean as it deserves to be?
<br />Want to display your House loyalty for all those Rogues to witness and fear?
<br />Then this Mod is for you!
<br />Now YOU can proudly display your national roots with the CTE House Scheme Mod. Get rid of that old Cardboard look and fly away with a snazzy and awesome looking Bretonia paint job. Or maybe Kusari is more your flavor? Or perhaps you'd rather look mean with the Liberty Warbird scheme?
<br />It's up to you!
<br />Personally, I'm Bretonian all the way with this pack. ^_^
<br />Simply take a look at the various beauty shots provided in each House folder, and pick the one that you like the most. Then copy the cv_ships.mat file from that folder into your Freelancer/Data/Ships/Civilian folder and voila! Your CTE range vessel has gone from boring cardboard, to nifty mean-looking house colors!

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=189' Target=_Blank> <b>Fast Load made by Integer Man </b> </a>
<br />This disables the three intro movies you encounter when you start up Freelancer.
<br />This same thing can be accomplished manually by editing the &quot;freelancer.ini&quot; file in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Freelancer\EXE. Just remove the three lines of code under &quot;[Startup&quot; and save the file. 
<br />Or put a ; in front of the lines. If you put a ; in front of a line the engine will not read that line it's called comment out.

<br />Now you can be a real miner's life. Now you can get a real money. Now you can get a great adventure. Going to the enemy's territory, deep in space, lonely, and start digging, quiet and fast, because they watch you.
<br />&quot;Try to get the milk to the cat being a rat.&quot; Old_Holander, drunk miner at Dresden System.
<br />&quot;I take my frigate, pull off the accelerator, and shoot at asteroids, tractor in the copper, trying not to blow up at the rocks, and the Xenos trying to put fire in my tail. What a run!&quot; At some bar in Colorado System.
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=183' Target=_Blank> <b>Simple MOD made by QuickSilver In Black </b> </a>
<br />On Planet Manhattan in the New York System you will get:
<br />A &quot;showcase&quot; of ALL mountable weapons and equipment that are available in the game. Planet Manhattan in the New York System is where you end up after you have finished the missions. You still must have the appropriate ship and be at the appropriate level in order to purchase these items. When you finish the missions you will not be at the required level, but this will allow you to see what is out there and give you something to shoot for.
<br />On Planet Crete in the Omicron Gamma System and on Planet Malta in the Omicron Alpha system you will get:
<br />All mountable weapons and equipment of Class 8 or greater and all ammo for everything in the game. You will get all the Nomad weapons including those that do not drop. After looking at a couple of those that do not drop, you will understand why the can bring you down with one shot! You will get all the special class 10 weapons, and even a couple of weapons that the designers named but forgot to include in the game. There are a lot of weapons, so I can understand how a couple got overlooked! Again, You still must have the appropriate ship and be at the appropriate level in order to purchase these items. I placed these items at these bases because they are the most difficult to get to. You must be at level 36 to purchase the Nomad and Special class 10 weapons.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=165' Target=_Blank> <b>Ultra Patriot Mod made by Karl Nyborg </b> </a>
<br />This mod doesn't do a lot. It makes the Patriot invincible and makes it so that it can also carry additional units of nanobots and shield batteries.
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=154' Target=_Blank> <b>TotalSP made by spOOn </b> </a>
<br />It's based on Xerx's OpenSP MOD which activated all JumpGates in singleplayer. Plus I removed all requirements to purchase equipment like shields or weapons and ships.
<br />Now that means that you can go everywhere and buy everything you want without having to do the singleplayer missions. Yet you will have to do the first two ones (Mission 1a and 1b) to activate the JumpGates, but after that you are free to do anything.

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=122' Target=_Blank> <b>Defender's Mod made by Defender </b> </a>
<br />Feature of this mod include:
<br />- All ships (pilotable) can be bought at level 1, doesn't matter what your reputation is... *(1)
<br />- All Equipment can be bought at level 1 (best to finish the first mission)
<br />- Almost everything is under 15$ *(2)
<br />- All ships (pilotable) have 9999 units for cargo... *(3)
<br />*(1) Of course, you're gonna have to be at least neutral to get permission to land or dock....
<br />*(2) This excludes the CMs and commodities (for those of you who like trading, the goods are still the same price..)
<br />*(3) It won't appear in the ship info, but it works (like when you buy a ship, it shows the stats of the ship...)

<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=107' Target=_Blank> <b>New System mod made by Dawn </b> </a>
<br />Ok here is a new system for Freelancer.
<br />All you have to do is: replace the original files with the files in this zip
<br />BUT MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR ORIGINAL FILES!!!!!!!!
<br />You can copy the whole files at once. Just copy the DATA dir over your original.
<br />It works for me and i hope for you too.
<br />You can look in the files so you see what i made. if you can&#180;t find anything that is changed... just search for &quot;da01&quot; (without quotation marks(?))
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=106' Target=_Blank> <b>OpenGate mod made by Xerx </b> </a>
<br />This is the Freelancer OpenGate MOD. It is to allow all jumpgates, wormholes, and secret areas to be enabled open access from the start of the game. This is for single player mode and with the story line intact. I recommend to finish at lest both part 1a and 1b of beginning game for Freelancer build version 1.0. This will not work for Multiplayer.
<br />Unzip into folder Data\Missions\M01 it will replace original M1a.ini file so please back that file up first! Rename this modified file Open_M1a.ini to M1a.ini, then copy over the original.
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=102' Target=_Blank> <b>Freelancer NoStory MOD made by Adam Pitcock </b> </a>
<br />This little mod of the mission files disables the single player story line for Freelancer. This MOD is intended for those who cannot run both the server app and Freelancer both at the same time well enough. Remember to back up your files!
<br />
<br /><b>Last but First </b> This was the first Mod submitted to Lancers Reactor.
<br />
<br /><a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/download/download.asp?id=93' Target=_Blank> <b>Pirate Mod v. 1.0 made by Chamileon Sun </b> </a>
<br />First off, gratz on checking out the very first Freelancer Mod. Now then, this is a pirate mod where you get to be the one house everybody loves to hate. Yep, the Xenos. New starting point, rep and starting loot. I had given you a different ship but I took that away as everyone at your base flies junk, why shouldn't you too.
<br />Don't expect all the Houses in the game to act the way they did before. They won't! Also, just because you are a Pirate House doesn't mean that the other Pirate Houses will take it easy on you. This is a great Multi Player script and a good challenge for those who think the game is easy.
<br />Works for FL Version 1.0 and up. (sorry, won't work on the demo because you don't have the zone)</div>
