			<h3><a href="#p336557" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">The Liberty rouges have developed 2(Currently, working on several more classes.) new ships.
<br />
<br />The Alliance VHF, with new guns &quot;Liberator Cannons&quot; Which are basicly new souped up ultra versions of the zoners photon blasters with a laser recharge rate.
<br />They can hold 50 nanobots and shield batteries, and carry 5 Liberator guns, and 4 Liberator turrets, on the wing pods that will become inter-system drives if they ever develop the technology or steal it. Sheilds are a superheavy type of positron shield, though they are currently developing a sheild that can switch types to better defend the ship in any given situation.
<br />
<br />However, the rogue's pride and joy is the new, Consitution Class battleships (Not to be confused with the trek ship, though the design was inspired by the class.)
<br />It is basicly somewhat based upon the lines of the constitution refit from trek, with the saucer and engineering hull and nacell pods. There are many diffrences though. The saucer connects with the forward end of the nacell pods (Currently weapon pods until the rogues get intersystem drives.), streghtening the ship as well as connected to the engineering hull where the main engine is. The rogues power it with a fusion core and are trying to develop an anti-matter reactor, though the results so far have been explosive to say the least. It carries 75 main fighters, and a secondary force (The bombers are in production) of 25 bombers in the saucer hanger. The saucer has 1 Mirage class torpedo launcher, soon to become infamous for being quickly changeable to handle any class of torpedo in existance. Problem is that it is bulky and it takes about a minute under ideal conditions to switch arment types. The launcher is on a swivel mount on the extreme front of the saucer. Also, it does carry 6 primary gun turrets on the saucer 3 facing port, starboard and fore on the lower surface and the same on the upper surface. The turrets exchange some power expinditure and damage for farther range and firing speed, in fact, the turrets are compareable to zoner photon blasters for refire rate.
<br />The engineering hull connector with the saucer carries the 3 other torpedo launchers for the ship, 2 facing forward, and one facing aft. The ship's main thrust point is located along the aft section of the connector. The forward end of the engineering hull sports one of the biggest diffrances from the design everyone knows. No forward deflector. Instead, a halfshpere to complete the forward end of the hull, and a single fighter bay for landings. Also on the very front of the hull are the twin forward cannons, stolen from liberty specs on the fateful night that redefined the rogues, and modified to increase the damage, range, and refire rate. The problem is that the use of these cannons quickly drains the power from the ship if used continueously, a major reason for trying to develop anti-matter reactors. They hope to have a working test model to install in the LFS-Constiution by her completion. Also, the engineering hull sports 5 secondary offensive turrets, one above the aft launch bay, and the other 4 on the centerpoint of the engineering hull. Also, on the struts that support the weapons pods are 6 flak turrets, much improved from liberty versions. They now fire fast and hard enough to in theory, take out gunships. A 7th one is mounted on the under side of the main bay ledge.
<br />The weapons pods have 4 primary turrets along their length each, on the upper surface, and on the side slope, there are 2 secondary turrets (The secondary turrets are designed to blast cruisers.) and 4 flak turrets.
<br />
<br />However the 2 biggest advances in capital ship design are almost done and will be used on this class. First is the most powerful shield ever developed for a captial ship, designed to several direct hits from reinland's biggest ships, in fact, be able to take an actual ramming run from the biggest ships, unlikely as either event is to be due to the other major advance.
<br />
<br />The SW coil, accidentally developed when the rogues tried to create their own jumpholes, can SEVERELY DROP the apparent mass of a ship, thus giving it greater thrust capibilities from a smaller engine for better effieceny, and allowing it to manuver like a class of much smaller mass, like a gunboat or frigate. The coil is currently too big to be used on fighters, but a version in development could very well allow the Alliance class fighters to manuver better than starfliers, thus giving the rogues unparalled advantages in combat.
<br />
<br />They are currently working on a less power consuming version of the cloaking device that should allow them to equip their constution class battleships is currently in the beginning stages of development.
<br />
<br />But, the rogues biggest development is that of their jump hole manipulator. It allows them to indefinately keep open ANY jumphole, and to manipulate it's re-emergance point. This allows them to basicly pull jumpholes away from guard forces and allow them free access to a system until it's occupying forces take note, and it also allows them to basicly shut off the cortez system end of their jumphole in New America. The problem with the tech is that if the hole shifts in mid-transit as has happened several times, the transiting ships are lost, how, is unknown, but they are lost.
<br />
<br />The rogues are currently Developing Essix Class carrier ships and Enterprise class Battlecruisers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Just out of development is our new MARC (Matter Antimatter Reactor Core), for use on all captial ships. It allows us to now use our biggest guns much longer than with convetional reactors, and it offers huge amounts of surplus power for shields and should we ever recive or steal inter-system drives, those as well.</div>

			<div class="content">Ageira Technologies
<br />Note: These technologies are usable by all factions Ageira is not currently hostile to.
<br />
<br />MERCURY STAR DRIVE
<br />Using external Jump technology, this allows a ship to perform a Jump across multiple systems. There is a high risk of destablization associated with longer distances, making long-range jumps dangerous, but this system is, regardless, far more efficient than the original Jump Gates.
<br />
<br />HERMES CANNON
<br />Also relying on external Jump technology, the Hermes Cannon is a weapon mounted on capital ships. Using a hook-up to Styx Station, in orbit around the Cortez System's sun, it instantly transmits the target to the other end - into the blazing inferno that is a system's central star.
<br />
<br />GENESIS RAY
<br />A variant of the Mercury. Raw materials are hauled by Planetform techs up to Eden Station near Cambridge, where they are transmitted through a highly co-ordinated Jump beam that effectively distributes them across a planet.
<br />
<br />IDUN SHIELD
<br />An incredibly powerful anti-energy shield that makes the user completely immune to energy, missile, and torpedo fire. Idun Shields cannot stop enemy landing craft and can only be mounted on stationary objects like planets and space stations. A ground force can destroy the shield generator, allowing the base to fall victim to an orbital bombardment.
<br />
<br />PROMOTHEUS
<br />Access Denied. Information on the Promotheus Project is available only to the executive and to project head Doctor William Larings.
<br />
<br />INNOVATION-CLASS BATTLESHIP
<br />A large battleship built as a security concern for Ageira space stations. Innovations are approximately two kilometers long, and carry eight capital ship turrets, with a Hermes Cannon as a main gun. There are nineteen Innovation-class ships currently in service.
<br />
<br />SOLDIER-CLASS VERY HEAVY FIGHTER
<br />Designed to assist in security patrols. The Soldier is based loosely on the Liberty Defender and can wield up to level 8 equipment, making it a highly dangerous enemy. Soldiers do not carry Jump drives.</div>

			<div class="content">LIBERTY NAVY SHIP DATABASE:
<br />VANQUISHER-CLASS SUPER COMMAND CARRIER
<br />Similar ships:Super Star Destroyer
<br />No ship in the colonies can equal the destructive capability of Vanquisher-class Super Command Carrier.
<br />15 km long and of colossal size, the Vanquisher's form sends fear into the hearts of Liberty's enemies.
<br />It has six huge hangars around the ship, and it can house a maximum of 700 Spartan fighters. In fact, it's
<br />hangars are so large that they can house ships up to the size of gunboats and corvettes. It carries huge
<br />armament:140 capital ship laser cannons, 800 flak laser cannons, 16 EMP cannons and 24 cutter beam emitters
<br />(those beams that cut through ships' hulls). Due to large costs and crew required by Vanquisher-class ships,
<br />only two ships of that class, LNS Vanquisher and LNS Sovereign have been built. The Vanquisher acts as
<br />the personal flagship of admiral James Redmond, supreme commander of Liberty military. Only admirals
<br />and above can command Vanquisher-class ships
<br />
<br />ATHENA-CLASS COMMAND CARRIER.
<br />Similar ships &lt;http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif&gt; eacekeeper Command Carrier(obviously), Scarran Dreadnaught
<br />The Athena-class Command Carrier is second in size and weaponry only to the Vanquisher-class Super
<br />Command Carrier. The Athena is 5km long and composed of two separate hulls(look like battleships), which house
<br />power systems, weapons and most of the ship's facilities, and a hull section located between the two
<br />hulls that houses the ship's hangars. The Athena-class acts as flagships of Liberty fleets, with two
<br />Command Carriers for each fleet. Athena-class ships carry armament of 60 capital ship laser cannons,
<br />200 flak laser cannons, eight EMP cannons 16 torpedo launchers and eight cutter beam emitters.
<br />It can carry up to 250 Spartan fighters. Athena-class ships are usually commanded by an officer
<br />ranked rear admiral.
<br />
<br />VANGUARD-CLASS BATTLESHIP.
<br />Similar ships:USS Enterprise-E, Imperial Star Destroyer, Romulan D'Deridex-class warbird. Vor'cha cruiser
<br />The Vanguard-class battleship is the primary combat vessel of Liberty Navy. It is 2500 meters long and it
<br />can be used in independent operations such as commanding small battlegroups. Howewer, it is most oftenly
<br />used in large fleet groups, escorting Command Carriers and providing firepower. It is armed with 30 capital
<br />ship laser cannons, eight torpedo launchers, 6 EMP cannons, 120 flak laser cannons and four cutter beam
<br />emitters. It can carry up to 80 Spartan fighters and is usually commanded by an officer ranked commodore.
<br />
<br />SENTINEL-CLASS CRUISER
<br />Similar ships:The cruiser Luke and Leia are standing on at end of Empire Strikes Back(don't remember the
<br />name), Nebula-class starships from Star Trek.
<br />The Sentinel-class cruiser is the primary capital ship of the Liberty navy. It is 1200 meters long and can
<br />be used in variety of missions ranging from patrol to full-scale combat. It is armed with 15 capital ship
<br />laser cannons, six torpedo launchers, 4 EMP cannons and 60 flak laser cannons. It can carry 20 Spartan
<br />fighters and is commanded by an officers ranked captain.
<br />
<br />MARAUDER-CLASS ATTACK CORVETTE
<br />Similar ships:Talyn, Millenium falcon, USS Defiant.
<br />The Marauder-class attack corvette is used by the Liberty Navy has fast recon, hit 'n run, special ops
<br />and deep incursion ship. It is equipped with cloaking devices(OOC:Is it ok), making it perfect for
<br />missions requiring discretion and covert measures. It has a small hangar, which houses 10 fighters,
<br />howewer, it is not normally used to transport fighters.It is armed with four capital ship laser
<br />cannons, two EMP cannons, 12 flak laser cannons and two torpedo launchers. Because of high
<br />computerization of Marauder-class' systems, it's full crew is only 45 crewmembers plus embarked
<br />fighter and special ops personnel. Howewer, if it is necessary, it can be fully operational with
<br />only 20 crewmembers. The Marauder-class is often employed as support craft for special ops unit
<br />such as Navy Commando Teams and Special Retrieval Squads. It is usually commanded by a liutenant
<br />commander or a captain(Marauders used in special ops are commanded by captains)
<br />
<br />FLR-850 &quot;SPARTAN&quot; VERY HEAVY FIGHTER.
<br />Similar ships:X-Wing fighter, Peacekeeper Prowlers and Marauders,
<br />The Spartan VHF replaces Defender as Liberty Navy's combat fighter. It's eight level 10 gun/missile
<br />mounts and 1 rear turret, advanced countermeasures, 1 torpedo/cruise disruptor mount, mine mount,
<br />level 10 shields and advanced thrusters provide extreme firepower, protection and maneuverability.
<br />It can be equipped with cloaking devices, and due to that ability, it is often used alongside Marauders
<br />in special missions and supporting SRS (Special Retrieval Squad)units. The Spartan is flown by one crewmember.
<br />Most of Spartan pilots are usually at least sergeants. Flight(5) leaders are usually liutenants,
<br />squadron(10) leaders senior liutenants or captains and wing(20-40)commanders liutenant commanders.
<br />
<br />LIBERTY NAVY STANDARD FLEET ORGANIZATION:
<br />A Liberty Navy standard unit is a Fleet. Each fleet is composed of following units:
<br />2 Combat Groups each composed of 1 Command Carrier, 24 battleships, 144 marauders and 72 cruisers.
<br />Two Recon Wings each composed of 24 Marauders.
<br />Total:2 Command Carriers, 48 Battleships, 144 Cruisers. 7720 fighters. 480 Marauders.
<br />NOTE:2nd and 3rd Fleets each have also one Super Command Carrier
<br />LIBERTY NAVY INDEPENDENT COMBAT GROUP ORGANIZATION.
<br />ICG's are Navy units smaller than Fleets.
<br />16 battleships 48 cruisers and 96 Marauders.
<br />Total:16 Battleships, 48 Cruisers, 96 Marauders and 2240 fighters.
<br />
<br />
<br />VICTORY-CLASS DROPSHIP SUPPORT SHIP:
<br />The Victory-class dropship is designed to support Liberty Marine Corps' ships and personnel.
<br />It is 2.5 km long and it can carry a full bridgade of marines(10314 troops). It has eight docking
<br />bays(not hangars) on it's sides. Each is designed to dock one Guardian-class dropship.
<br />The hangar, which is located on the lower part of the ship, houses smaller Invader and Higgins
<br />class dropships. Altough Victory-class is not designed to indepently engage hostile
<br />ships, it is designed to have enough firepower to support the marine ships and to guarantee combat survive-
<br />ability and it carries 20 capital ship laser cannons and 150 flak laser cannons..Each Victory-class ship
<br />carries 35 Higgins-class dropships and 26 Invader-class dropships. Victory-class ships also have extensive
<br />medical and C3I(Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence)facilities aboard for the marines.
<br />
<br />GUARDIAN-CLASS DROPSHIP.
<br />The Guardian-class dropship is largest of Liberty dropships. It has it's own capability for long
<br />range independent travelling, and it's size makes it's dropship classification questionable.
<br />It is 300 meters long and 40 meters wide(has wings). It can carry 1680 marines or 20 VSV's.
<br />It has 20 flak laser cannons on it's upper part and another 20 on lower part. It has total 20
<br />laser cannons, which are designed to provide support for disembarkation, on it's wings.
<br />NOTE:Guardian-class ships are used in transporting heavy equipment, such as VSV's and are not
<br />usually employed in troop transport missions.
<br />
<br />INVADER-CLASS DROPSHIP.
<br />The Invader-class dropship transports Liberty Marines where Guardian is too large to go to.
<br />It is 55 meters long, and can carry 336 marines. It has 14 laser cannons for fire support
<br />(looks bit like Mi-26)
<br />
<br />HIGGINS-CLASS DROPSHIP.
<br />The Higgins-class is the smallest Liberty dropship. It is small and agile, and due to it's
<br />size and agility it is often used to transport marines from one place to another in the planet
<br />It can carry 48 marines, and has 6 laser cannons, four of them in front of the ship and two
<br />in turrets, one in each side. It also has two missile launchers. It is 25 meters long.
<br />(looks like those Republic air transports from SW:Episode 2)
<br />
<br />LIBERTY NAVY MARINE SUPPORT GROUP STANDARD ORGANIZATION:
<br />A Liberty Navy Marine Support Group(MSG) is a spaceship task force with composition of ships meant
<br />for supporting Marine Corps units by providing dropship and fire support for marine forces. One MSG
<br />carries a corps(10 bridgades) of Liberty marines.
<br />MSG CAPITAL SHIPS:10 Victory-class dropship support ships, 12 Vanguard-class battleships, 66 Sentinel-
<br />class cruisers. 5 Supply-class Marine Supply Ships(supply-class ships are basically supply and weapons
<br />storages equipped with engines). 80 Guardian-class dropships
<br />SMALL SHIPS:350 Higgins-class dropships, 260 Invader-class dropships.960+1320</div>

<br />
<br />
<br />Currently working on New fleet carrier to move battle fleets into position. Called the Starbase class. Unit production max WILL be 10. Expect to encounter the first sometime 2 months from now. And yes, I will admit the rogues, no wait, LRF has not had a fleet, but they have discovered things that will allow their fleet to perform better than anything hispania, rhineland, liberty, or kusari offers. Oh, and we haven't gotten to kusari yet.
<br />
<br />Also working on light cruiser class to assist fleets
<br />
<br />Fleet orgaization:
<br />
<br />battleship (Fleet command unit One per fleet)
<br />
<br />taskforces (5 per fleet)
<br />
<br />Carrier (Taskforce leader)
<br />2 battlecruisers
<br />1 HCC
<br />2 Light cruisers
<br />4 destroyer/frigates.
<br />
<br />Found a good reason why I should not use the long range feature of the envelope drive. Remote gathering over 1/2 lightyears of distance causes damage to the space time continuum. Also, continuous travel over 100 lightyears or more will also have the same effect, causing rifts in space time which will cause major havoc.
<br />
<br />(Yes, that came to mind from a trek episode. Convient solution though. Drive takes a lot of power though. Only marc equipped ships can use it or the re-router.)
<br />
<br />Slight refit to battleship class:
<br />
<br />Added: Second layer of spectal shielding in response to threats against LRF
<br />Envelope generator *Small deflector dish type structure on front of engineering hull*
<br />Jump hole re-routers Installed in nacells. Nacells expanded slightly to accompany extra equipment.
<br />Landing space for: 50 Protector light fighters and 25 Deerhound heavies in the saucer section.
<br />
<br />2 AMM torpedo launchers on saucer swivel mounts.
<br />Magazine space for 100 more AMM torpedos.
<br />
<br />Protector light fighter stats:
<br />
<br />Extreme low-level envelope generator (In final stages of trying to develop. Short range bursts only. Less than 10 lightyears.)
<br />Light fighter spectral shielding.
<br />4 Liberator guns (Light version)

<br />1 pilot
<br />20 cargo space
<br />CM mount
<br />Mine mount
<br />Thruster mount
<br />Cruiser disruptor/torpedo mount. Room for 10 torpedos or cruise disruptors.
<br />
<br />Oh, and for size comparsion, the BB is the size of a galaxy, the Carrier is the size of a sovergn/excalibur; the BC is the size of an ambassador, as is the HCC.</div>
