			<div class="content">okay heres a new thing.
<br />i was really dissapointed to not have a huge fleet to fleet battle.
<br />
<br />you know a combination of the navys of the free worlds led by the osiris versus a huge nomad fleet.
<br />dozens of wings of fighters screaming in taking out hard points of b-ships and cruisers, close range broadsides between the ships. massive shots going back and forth. waves upon waves of enemy fighters.
<br />
<br />realistic capship damage, when your torpedo hits the bridge of an unshielded ship, there should be damage to match such as a sudden disorganization around it. also i would like to see laser burn, visible battle scars on your ship. also you know those kill tallies that used to be painted on the side of ships, those would be great as well.

<br />some fall.... I FLY!</div>

			<div class="content">I would like to see a result for what i do. I should be able to kill all the gains if i want to. 50 sunslayers should take out a battleship at least. 
<br />
<br />As with the Stations,  atomatic mining would be nice. Like the gas miners.
<br />Bounties, you get creds for each criminal you shoot, or good guy.
<br />
<br />Ability to sell information.
<br />
<br />Minigames would be nice.  ig-2000, i mean you can race  (yeah i knowsaid before), drinking contests in bars, shooting (target practice, on land and in ships), duel, contests like who can get highest score in freelancer mini game (thank you paddy), who can rack up the most kills of  zenos gains bounty hunters gmg, who can mine the fastest, i can't think of a way to put in a sport. soccer but space?

			<h3><a href="#p304166" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">well i agree with almost everything and i have a few ideas of my own
<br />disagree
<br />
<br />FUEL: Fuel can ge pissy what if are in a big battle and you run out, what if you run out period
<br />
<br />MULTIPLE SHIPS : okay this would be good i thoery but what if say you have your light fighter in liberty and your flying you frieghter in  kusari and you want to switch (see battlehips)
<br />
<br />JOYSTICKS : i think that joysticks COULD  be okay under the following that there are not to may coplacated buttons and that they keep the keyboard mouse the same
<br />
<br />ADD ON'S : 
<br />
<br />BATTLESHIPS : i think that flying battle ship should not be like flying a regaluar fighter ship it shold be that you are on the bridge and a star trek thing were you tell your tactical adviser when to fire or who to fire and you have a navagator set course also i think multiple ships should only be allowed if you own a battle ship becuase you can store them there
<br />see transports for cargo details
<br />
<br />TRANSORTS: have you ever scanned a transport or a cargo train and thought &quot;hey 40,000 gold thats like a million credits i wish i could have one of those&quot; also players could transport mass amounts of controband well you should be able to but if your worried about get rich to easy first if your going anywhere you would have to hire wingmen a good many and also you need tons of mony to start out if 40,000 gold is over a million credits you'll need a million to buy the gold and battle ships they should be able to transport  500,000 of anything
<br />
<br />THE WHOLE UNIVERSE : the universe should contantly changing in small ways that build up to big changes selling of planets solar systems ect... wars beetween colonies ones that end and begin and being able to make it on to the news for example if you destory say 500 transports hey thats news worthie if you comand a fleet of battle ships hey evryone should know and fear you
<br />
<br />CONVERSING : you should have more advanced coversations with A.I
<br />
<br />MISSIONS: you should be able to freelance for a number of missions for example you can sign contracts with the liberty navy to do a series of missions that are linked
<br />
<br />BOUNTY HUNTING: for some bounty missions you talk to a guy in a bar he tells you to hunt bobby he tells you of another guy who works somewere knows about him ect.. so sometimes you have to look for the guy throughly and you can get led all over the colonies
<br />
<br />well i hope you agreee with my ideas good luck with convicing the designers
<br />
<br />
<br />

			<div class="content">sorry if im being constant but i thought of a few more things to say 
<br />
<br />skins: i understand why the fl people put one playable unchanable person  but i think it would be better if you firstly had a bar that you slid up and down for skin colour and then you had a bunch of hair styles  that could be edited and diffferent builds for the people different eyes and then you start out with a few different basic cloths but you can purchase new ones you could have a whole fashion idustry heehee 
<br />
<br />joining goverments and guilds : noooooooooooooo  its FREELANCER AKA FREELANCING NONE OF THIS ' BE PART OF THE ORGANIZATIONS STUFF as i said in my earlier message you should be hired for more then one mission sometimes although i am tempted to support it i feel that i just should not happen 
<br />
<br />Friends: for people you meet you should have a relashonship with them and the better friends you are the more they offer and say and they could become your wingmen form time to time
<br />
<br />On ground movment: i would like  to see a but of walking around on the planet just walking into the bar or shop just so it gives a feel its you on the ground
<br />
<br />Drinking: this is random and serves no purpose but howabout when your in the bar you can get a drink and order a little food maybe even smoke i dunbno it just would be cool

			<div class="content">in fl 2 its nav map should be 3d like in eve online loot more systems to explore. my friend read some thread about fl2 in msdn there was some talk about universe, everybody knows full nav map where you can see every system i think there are going to be like 3 more like that and every system are going to have 1 or more sub systems like planets he read something about that you can fly inside the planet  going place to place like from space port to a equipment dealer i think there are going to be mutilple dealers on the planet like police equipment and civ equipment ship upgrades are possible hopefully he isnt sure about  that but upgrades like armor, power core , gargo space, and maneuver upgrades might be awailable.
<br />seriously i cant wait for fl 2 <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<div class="content">I dont care if theres 5 or 6 planets i just want to be able to chase pirates then they can go onto planets (flying into planets all in real-time) then chase them down and arrest them on land.  Then you can do jobs in space or on land. Own a house. Set up a business. maybe own a space station. Hopefully its not going to be a Massive Multiplayer online action rpg. Like i said i really dont care if theres a couple of systems and a few planets as long as they would do a lot of work into detail of the planets and systems.

			<div class="content">ok the best way i can say this is one server!!!
<br />
<br />wouldnt it be cool to take out the Most of the NPCs and justhave thousand of other players!!  it would take a long time to make such a game but it would be worth it.  just think starwars galaxiesw meets freelancer.  buying bases and such.  no more factions just clans. massive amounts of clans.  another thing. lets not have set ships. you can have a few but if u read those freelancer stories there are like used old 20 year old ships that people &quot;Have&quot; to be cause its all they can aford.  if you make another freelancer go BOG or dont go at all.  
<br />
<br />also being able toconstruct or destruct a base would be totally awsome.
<br />
<br />in freelancer i hate that u cant dock with flying battleships but you cant kill standing ships.
<br />
<br />-make the guns and commodities not set either.  mabye one day a trader has this the next day he dosent.  it would be more realistic.  
<br />
<br />another thing i hate about freelancer is that the eagle is the best ships.  i think is is a very ugly ship.  letrs say in freelancer 2 you can take a ship you start with and add different engines and upgrade the hulls and stuff.  even like on wings, compartments and rooms so u can actually walk around ur ship.  
<br />
<br />another cool thing i though about would be multi post ships.  more than one person in a ship.  it would get lonly in real space.
<br />
<br />
<br />i wanna see bigger galaxeis.  in real life you would not be able to get from earth to mars easily much less like earth to pluto.  i wanna see a full RPD were nothing is the same and everyone isnt flying around in the same ship with the same wep configuration, make it harder, make it bigger</div>

			<div class="content">For FL2.....
<br />
<br />the add'l ideas I like thus far are:
<br />* &quot;discover&quot; the storyline.
<br />* in SP mode, be able to help defeat a faction from the game.
<br />   (However, a new one would appear later in the game to keep it interesting!)
<br />* keep the game evolving (like life).  
<br />* auto turrets.
<br />* dump the trade lands, bring back hyper-space
<br />* Yea, longer story line.
<br />
<br />Other ideas:
<br />* like Privateer I: Engine/ thruster upgrades that actually make a difference.   For instance, with thrusters, offer upgrades that either consume less energy or offer higher top speed OR both.  (I hate the fact that in FL1 all thrusters have the same top speed.)  
<br />* Mission-stacking.  If 3 missions offered are at the same place, I WANT ALL 3 OF THEM!!!
<br />* Don't force the story-line down my throat.  In Privateer 1, I could take my time between missions.
<br />* Keep the game evolving!  Sid Meier is renowned for Civ II etc for providing an always new game experience.
<br />* Rumors/ News.  Make them mean something important to the game.  Either a hint or the location of your next level shield, engine, thruster, etc.  Or maybe how to win your current mission.
<br />* The creator of the Nomads returns and ..........?!?!
<br />* Allow relationships to develope and remain.
<br />* NO exploring the planets...this is a space-sim.  You can explore planets in Unreal.
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading this.
<br />
<br />Also, thanks to all you great modders out there who have made a great game even greater!!!

			<div class="content">Well, my 2 cents.. well.. it's 3.5 with the current inflation, and 5.9 with interest.. but that's besides the point.......
<br />
<br />Personally, I think it'd add more depth to add a &quot;first person&quot; perspective when on planets, or Space Stations.  This way, instead of just clicking on the nav bar, you'd have to manually navigate bases.  Obviously, for those who dont want to do this, you could have the nav bar optional.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you could have more cities on each planet.. I'm pretty sure there are more than just one. Again, you could fly between them manually or use the nav bar.  There would ofcourse be certain limitations.. Battleships are probably not docking on the ground, the would dock in space, and you could shuttle down.
<br />
<br />Another idea, for those who own their own base, or capital ship.  Maybe instead of only owning 1 ship, maybe you could own several provided you have the room for them. I think owning your own Base would be excellent especially for squadrons and clans. It would give them an official Base of Ops.
<br />
<br />That brings me to the next idea, Custom Missions.  Say you're a transport pilot and some clan of pirates force you to drop your goods... well when you get back to base, you could set up a mission for anyone interested.  The person who sets up the mission, would have the funds pulled from his account until the mission was either completed, or until he cancelled the offer. If anyone took the mission,  the &quot;employer&quot; wouldnt be able to cancell the offer without the pilots approval, but the pilot could reject the offer at anytime.
<br />
<br />Everything else I've seen has been good so far I think. I think auto turrets would also be good, but maybe also have a co-operative mode for capital ships, or transports where 1 person pilots the vessel, while someone else acts as a gunner. In respect, this could be done with any ship that had turrets, but would probably want to be left for larger ships with very few forward mounted weapons.
<br />
<br />I guess the last thing is a tweak. Anyone here know what a turret is? A turret is any unguided weapon that is in some way trainable.  That would make basically EVERY weapon in Freelancer a Turret. It doesnt matter how small the firing arc is, if it can be trained, it is indeed a turret.  I'd like to see this fixed.  Everything should have a specified firing arc. Turrets mounted under the ship cant fire up, turrets mounted on top cant fire down, etc etc.  Weapons that are not turrets, should be fixed firing only in the direction the ship is pointed.  I think this will add some stratagy to some styles of gameplay.  Limited Firing Arcs means blind spots that smaller ships can exploit.  For instance, a freigher that has 4 forward facing weapons, and 4 defensive turrets, is probably vulnerable to attacks directed to it's aft sections where it's firing arc cant reach.  I know this kinda dulls the teeth a little, but lets be real, it's a frieghter, not a gun boat.  Although a gunboat would probably suffer the same limitations, but that's why we have piloting skills.. if you are dumb enough to fly a straight line, then you deserve to be shot.  I would also like to see sensor limitations, forcing you to upgrade and improve your systems.
<br />
<br />Well, maybe that brings me to the real last thing LOL --- Realistic AI. Or atleast smarter AI. I dont know bout you, but if I was running a freighter, I do just that.. RUN if I got attacked. The computer will attack you with EVERYTHING unfriendly to you, including transport vessels. THAT needs to be fixed LOL
<br />
<br />Anyway, I hope FL2  is in the makes.  Keep the flight controls the same, but maybe add the option for  joystick and &quot;classic&quot; flight controls.

<br />PS -- On ship speeds.. this is my take.  Some thinks it's backwards.. but lets think about it. Capital ship should be the fastest hands down. BIG engines, massive powerplants. They just arent manueverable. Everyone thinks Fighters should automatically be the fastest, but that's kinda  odd if you ask me. If you ships fits in one engine with PLENTY of room to maneuver, and it has 5 or more of these.. it's probably faster than you <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Remember, in space size dont matter, only thrust. Also, keep in mind.. in space &quot;contant thrust=constant acceleration&quot;. I see potential <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />Sticks and stones may break my bones.. but OH CRAP HE'S GOTTA GUN!!!!!!!!!
