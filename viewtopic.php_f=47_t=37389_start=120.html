			<div class="content">good points, his problem is, it the eyes or sirius, he is a NOMAD, they don't know of the Ta'Gue'Led, and so how would they know he's helping them, as far as they're concerned he is a destroyer of all things human which will lead to him having to stay as somewhat of a recluse or even (at some point) be hunted by characters in the game. being someone who is trying to help humanity not destroy it, he would be inclined to flee and be a pacifist, not stand and fight those he is there to help. i agree, he does need a weakness, something with complications due to his symbiote? i'll think about it. 
<br />
<br />secondly with the name, &quot;nomad&quot; is a human made name to describe these beings, the Dom'Kavash(which i guess could also be a man-made name?) would most likely have a diferent name for the nomads. I cant remember the fan fic, its the one where the Dom'Kavash contact Trent Telekinetically i believe, the nomads are kiven a name much like his in the language of the Dom'Kavash. i always feel inclined to shorten the name to Ta' so do as you like, just remember noone in sirius except the nomads and the Ta'Gue'Led know of the Ta's existance...
<br />
<br />anyway, i think thats everything you asked for....thanks for the feedback</div>

In the fanfic, we have established that the nomads were at one point a small race of unintelligent creaturees mutated and deformed by Mason into their present form as his tool of gaining control of Sirius (deviating of course from the assumed storyline set down in Freelancer).

<br />Not quite!
<br />
<br />In my original fanfic, the Nomads were merely 'summoned' by Mason. He couldn't quite 'control', or 'leash' them..yet. He merely found a way to draw them to a point where he wanted, like a pet falcon.
<br />
<br />Further, the Nomads were deemed unintelligent, but definitely sentient and <b> primal  </b> beings, that the Dom'Kavash had created as the ultimate guardians for themselves aeons ago.
<br />
<br />All of the above are in the 'vanilla' Freelancer game universe, and so far, remains true in both my fanfic, and the CYOF RPG. For now! <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I think what Fallen is suggesting with his character means there's a group of Nomads that 'evolved' somehow away from their instinctive nature and become more 'aware'.
<br />
<br />That is a divergence from the original FL story / background, hence the debate here how to apply it because in it's current state Fallen's character is still fairly powerful compared to everyone else. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

			<h3><a href="#p372648" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">As promised, my idea...
<br />
<br />So we know that the Nomads are guardians of some sort. Yet they also seem to be &quot;unintelligent, but definitely sentient and primal beings&quot;. However, that did not stop them from initiating an exceedingly well-planned takeover of the Rheinland government. I would say that's hardly the work of unintelligent beings. There is a bit of a disconnect here, imo.
<br />
<br />So how to solve it? Well, we're told that the Nomads were created by the DK to act as guardians and caretakers. Now, if we make the reasonable assumption that the DK are very advanced, we can safely go a step further. The &quot;Nomads&quot; as we knew them in Freelancer proper are not one homogeneous group. We can say that there are three tiers or castes in a hierarchical system.
<br />
<br />The bottom level will be the actual Nomads. These will be the primal, unintelligent organisms which function as drones, essentially. There will also be lots of them. They can be controlled through the manipulation of certain artifacts. We know Mason and his merry band of megalomaniacs have some such artifacts, which explains the limited degree of control he can exert of some of them.
<br />
<br />Next level will be the &#8220;specialist Nomads&#8221;. If there's a problem that a drone can't fix, the second tier Nomads will be responsible. These guys would actually fit the TGL bill quite well, I think. There won't be a whole lot of them, but they'll have intelligence enough to question their orders if they don't seem to make sense. And, since they are technically-minded to a large degree, (to fit in with FA's idea) they will be impressed by human achievements. Of course they'll also be stuck because they can't openly rebel. They neither have numbers nor power on their side, at least not initially.
<br />
<br />The highest level will be the &#8220;managers&#8221;, for lack of a batter way of describing it. These'll be the ones who are supposed to control the drones though use of whatever artifacts and such are necessary. They'll also be the ones who planned and executed much (if not all) of the covert operations in Freelancer itself. Make no mistake, these guys are smart and they know humanity is a threat to their own power. That's why they fought us.
<br />
<br />Now that the background is sort of out of the way, I'll describe the current situation.
<br />
<br />There are still craploads of drone Nomads. Some were sucked away at the Dyson Sphere but most were left behind. We see them in the Omicrons. The specialists are also around, to a degree. Again, some were lost in the final battle of FL, but there are plenty who weren't in the Sphere at the time. The managers, however, are all but gone. The Dyson Sphere would have been their base of operations. The only ones outside of it would have been those tasked to possess certain humans. So essentially the Nomads are headless.
<br />
<br />What this means is that the drones will work with their last orders &#8211; probably something along the lines of &#8220;kill all humans&#8221; - but won't do so in a very effective way. At least, that's what'll happen until Mason comes along and starts playing puppet master.
<br />
<br />The specialists, free from having to worry about being attacked by the managers or drones for insubordination, will band together and try to ally with the humans (as the TGL do in FA's idea).
<br />
<br />Does this make sense to anyone other than me?</div>

			<div class="content">yes code that does make sense and was what i was thinking to a certain degree i just hadn't gotten it that thought out. it would seem like a group set up to guard would either be so mindless they would have designated patrol routes and attack anything they crossed, or quite intellegent to hold their own. your idea seems to be an amalgamation of the two, like i sugested (or at least i ment to sugest) the nomads cant be that dumb if they conducted their coup in rhineland. thanks for the defence =P 
<br />
<br />now onto athena's concerns. Gabriel is by no means superman. he just isnt average, like everyone in the game. he is very simular to tanya in parts with the skills and the general &quot;super human&quot; aspects she has from being a weapon (i see her like the girl in the movie resident evil 2 somewhat... if thats a good comparison) Gabriel's skills are by no means better than this, he still is human, but has the benifits of two minds. he doesnt have all the remarkable gismos rob seems to own. he always seems to have exactly what he needs at each point in time. take a look at the characters in there already, i dont thing gabriel is any better than them, and if he seems like he is, I wouldnt write him to be able to dodge bullets and fly, it would ruin the story. im not really sure what the main characters' weaknesses are except being human. rob's love for tanya? tanya's qust for revenge clouding her judgement? dev's irrationality? take a look again at them and then question my character, from my point of view, which right now is still an observer to a degree, these three characters seem quite powerful themselves. Dev is a tank, rob has every gadget he could ever possibly need short of a personal force field, and tanya's combat skills are unrivaled. 
<br />
<br />just my two cents</div>

<br />I think the problem is that none of us know what that means, exactly. So it's hard to gauge the balance or lack thereof. Outline what mental powers Gabriel has gained. Only then will any concerns have a chance of being put to rest.</div>

			<div class="content">its nothing crazy like mind tricks ect, just the idea &quot;two minds are better than one&quot; he is less suseptible at making careless errors ect, and has a greater knowledge of the inner workings of the nomads and their history. this of course would be a giant information well, and put a large burden/a lot of power because i would have pretty much soul discretion to write the nomad background story, but this ocean of information can be all but ignored, at least for a while because i doub he would be having any sort of contact with the main characters right now.
<br />
<br />another thought, it would be more believable if he spent years at gammu to understand and aclimatize to everything, so in that case we would be arriving now in bretonia rushed out of gammu due to the nomad threat. he would not be comepletly trained, a little confused, and still wary of human contact, so he's a little weaker because of that, and it would also make it more intertesting him having to fend for himself with out everything handed to him by the TGL on a silver platter.</div>

<br />Course you may. The question is can  you? Requirements being basic typing skills, some decent quality of imagination, a tolerance for insanity...Also, the ability to follow rules of continuity, coherence, and originality, plus basic grammar knowledge (nothing fancy, just intelligible.) <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
