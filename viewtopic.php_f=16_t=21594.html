			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p14766" class="post-subject">Dueling Tactics?</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Something I always like to discuss with my fellow players is the tactics they like to use in a duel.  Everyone seems to have their tricks and tips, and I was wondering if anyone would be interested in sharing a few on this forum.  Any kind of trick is useful, but I don't think anyone wants to hear a whole load of bragging, so please let's keep the leet talk to a minimum.
<br />
<br />I'll start off with a few, not because I'm such a great dueler, but more because I'm hoping to set the tone for a free exchange of information.  Feel free to disagree with any tricks or tips you read here, but please discuss why you disagree, and what trick you prefer to use instead.  I am interested in all opinions and experiences in these matters.
<br />
<br />I'm also making the assumption that the posters/readers have played the game enough to know about all the basics such as engine kill movement, torpedo and mine usage, weapon stats etc. 
<br />
<br />A few of mine (obvious ones generally):
<br />A common tactic in combat is to stop dead (or slow down to regular engine speed) behind your opponent, to give an earlier bead on your opponent.  This is obviously counterable with good usage of mines.  However, I find a quick tap on the reverse key to put me in the 90-140 m/s zone can work wonders allowing me to get an aiming solution faster than my opponent, while keeping me at speed great enough to be safe from mines.  A great Drake tactic, but also good for eagles.
<br />
<br />Although I find torpedo's less affective against skilled opponents (who know enough to dodge), I do find one very useful facet in their natures regardless.  Some opponents when facing a torpedo-using player will turn out before completing a pass to minimize the exposure to that explosivey goodness.  This gives you a quick advantage in determining the direction of their turn before you pass.  This knowledge can be used to turn directly opposite their angle; allowing a greater distance between the two fighters when they are finally facing each other.  This is highly useful when facing a more manueverable fighter, as you can often get outside the range of their guns before they complete a turn.  A definite Saber vs Eagle tactic here.  <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />Ok there's a few.  Like I said, they aren't so great, they are just warm-ups.  What i really want to hear are some tips from the pros.  Let us know what tricks YOU use to beat us down so often :p</div>

			<div class="content">Well, I am not a good dueler (I'm sure Tasiin will take the time to remind me), but I do enjoy one on one Duels, win or lose.
<br />
<br />Tactics I use in Duels varies depending on who I am fighting, and what ship they have.  This is what I have:  Eagle VHF, 2x Tizona del Cids, 2x Nomad Energy Blasters, and 2x Nomad Energy Cannons.  Before each duel, I make deal with the player I'm fighting to use guns only, no torps, no shield batteries/nano bots.  
<br />
<br />When fighting a Sabre or Titan:
<br />At the start of the duel, I usually rush at them using thrusters, hit them hard head on, and quickly dodge back out and stay behind them the rest of the battle.  Engine kill is a great technique for this.  I *almost* never lose against Sabres/Titans (I have lost to very skilled pilots in Sabres/Titans).  In most battles against Sabres/Titans, I always managed to stay right behind the other player, and just chomp away until they scream mercy or die.  I usually take minimal damage.  Against very skilled pilots in Sabres/Titans, I have about 40/60 chance of winning/losing.  Against n00bs that fly the Titans based solely on Stats....it turns into a turkey shoot.  I loved the comments I got from one Sabre pilot I beat: &quot;I never even saw him!&quot;
<br />
<br />Against other Eagles however:
<br />When making the first pass with the other player, I do NOT head straight towards them.  I zig zag until i can work my way in behind and shoot them.  At all costs, I AVOID head on runs.  Engine Kill is a must, and frequent changes in direction are necessary, so I press the thruster button randomly.  Against a very skilled Eagle pilot, I'm usually dead before I even open fire.  Against a pilot evenly skilled as me, I have a 50/50 chance at winning.
<br />
<br />Last Note: I absolutely refuse to Duel one on one with people who insist on using missles.</div>

			<div class="content">i have mostly an easy tactic;
<br />
<br /><i><b>just shoot ur head out, and get him killed </i> </b>
<br />
<br />tactic 1 (do that mostly)
<br />get on his ass and stay their while shoot at him with my outcast particle blasters and a single shield buster on my drake
<br />
<br />tactic 2 (uhm, need for that a heavier fighter)
<br />do only head-on-head fire, press truster if u almost nearby him and do almost at the same time engine-kill and turn and the head-on-head starts again...

			<h3><a href="#p177910" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">ow before i forgot, i'm not good in using mines....
<br />
<br />u maybe know that i do good payed missions (150k and better) from crete and malta without much damage, sometimes no use of nano and shieldbots and no dam at all... i like agility above armor and weap-class and hardpoints...
<br />
<br />i flew first only the heaviest possible, but disliked the titan..... and yes i tested the titan as well as the other vhf, so don't say something about that....
<br />
<br />i do now in my own missions what i just did as high as possible with an eagle or sabre... and sometimes missions what i did with an other player, think about it.. against skilled pilots u must need a agile fighter as well, they know how to turn quickly with their type of fighter (it's to bad that there a lot of the same fighter users (mostly eagle or titan, some use the middle sabre))...
<br />
<br />just what i said, i like the agile fighters, if u wanna be a skilled agile pilot also, go to kusari space and do missions against the GC... they can fight good with their hawks...
<br />
<br />and if u wanna get one of the most agile fighter pilot of ur class, go to new york system and <b>dodge  starflier with no weap using  </b> (or only shoot with a class 3 weap, with class 8+ weaps, 1 shot for shield and 1 for hull)
<br />
<br />mostly i use a drake with this weapload
<br />- borroco (class 5)
<br />- pyros 2 (class 5)
<br />- pyros 3 (class 6)
<br />- pyros 3 (class 6)
<br />- hornet cruise disruptor
<br />no countermeasure and mines
<br />
<br />i'm not a good user of mines and countermeasure i don't use, the most missiles i outturn while dodge an other fighter, against disruptor missiles it's mostly worthless to use countermeasures and i don't run away with my drake...
<br />
<br />i like good fights
