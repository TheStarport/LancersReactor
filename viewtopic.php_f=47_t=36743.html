			<div class="content">Welcome to the first thread of the CYOF RPG #3!  <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />A reminder to all... Play begins on Monday, December 20th.
<br />
<br />In this thread, post your character's bios.  I added this element to include some more RP in this game.
<br />
<br />Tell us about your character.  (Which is the leader of the faction, in case you didn't know!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)  
<br />Include:
<br />Name  (Doesn't have to be your username, but make it something we can all remember, and that is somewhat similar to your username.)
<br />Age
<br />Position (Guildmaster, Leader, President, etc.)
<br />Faction
<br />Playing Style (Tell about how your character will behave while they play.  Are they agressive, defensive?  Do they make use of politics?  Do they trade a lot?  We WILL expect you to follow this loyaly to a certain extent, so choose wisely!)
<br />Possible Allies (Give a few factions who you expect to ally with.)
<br />Possible Enemies (Give a few factions who you might attack at some point.)
<br />Character Background (A short history of your character.)
<br />Anything else you would like to add.
<br />
<br />Again, we will be checking this, so choose wisely on your playing style and allies and enemies.  You can choose to make your enemies CLASSIFIED if you wish, but for RP sakes, we would like you to name at least one faction who you are not on good terms with, and it CAN be NPC.</div>

			<div class="content"><b>Bretonian Archives     </b>
<br />Information on the Royal Family 
<br />Access GRANTED
<br />
<br /><b>Name </b>:  King Jacob II of Bretonia
<br /><b>Age </b>: 24
<br /><b>Position </b>:  His Royal Magesty, King of Bretonia, Lord of New London, Duke of Cambridge, Prince of Leeds, Monarch of Edinburgh, Soverign of Dublin, Emperor of Manchester.
<br /><b>Faction </b>: Kingdom of Bretonia
<br /><b>Playing Style </b>: Cordial, and polite.  Agressive towards enemies, but merciful.  Does not like to attack others often, and is more defensive than offensive.
<br /><b>Possible Allies </b>:  Liberty, Kusari, Rheinland, IMG, Zoners  
<br /><b>Possible Enemies </b>:  Corsairs*, Mollys
<br /><b>Background </b>:  Grandson of King Jacob I, or Jacob the Conqueror, who got Bretonia an empire that streached across half of Sirius, this Jacob is eager to do the same.  He is a very young bachelor, which is odd for a King.  When he was 15, as the Prince of Leeds, he left his family and joined the Armed Forces.  He was a great pilot, and he forged a false ID for himself so he could be a regular person for a while.  He flew numerous sorties against Bretonia pilots, and he was eventually promoted to the rank of Commander, when he was given a squadron to command.  He was given the assignment of protecting his family as they went from Planet New London to Southhampton for an inspection.  The mission had a bit of irony for Jacob, but he went with it anyways.  Halfway to Southhampton, their tradelane was attacked by a huge attack force of Corsairs.  Jacob's wing fought bravely, killing most of the Corsairs, but as they retreated, their leader fired off a torpedo, and it destroyed the transport that the Royals were in.  
<br />After, Jacob gave up the Armed Forces, and returned to take his rightful place as King. 
<br />*-Depends on how things go.

<br /><b>History:  </b> Installed by President Jacobi after the Nomad incident, Chancellor Codename has focused heavily on rebuilding Rheinland's devastated economy and military. He has not had much contact with the rest of Sirius as of yet but, presumably, his appoinment by the President indicates that he is a man to be trusted and respected. Now that Rheinland is on the road to recovery the Chancellor will begin to communicate more with the worlds outside Rheinland.

<br />Age: 41
<br />Title: Portmaster
<br />Faction: Lane hackers
<br />Attitude: curt,expansionist,mildly aggressive, more worried about survival and expanding to nearby systems than anything else.
<br />Possible allies:corsairs, outcasts, liberty rogues,xenos(possibly but extreme),junkers.
<br />Possible enemies: houses, house corps, bounty hunters.
<br />
<br /> Micheal Locke became the leader of the hackers in a unknown way that has affected the corperations heavily, after Micheal Locke came to power the hackers became more and more agressive building new bases any place they could and even trying to renovate Ithaca.It is said that he used to be an outcast who was expelled for being &quot;overly harsh&quot; on corsair prisoners that were being interrogated by outcast officials.This has not yet been proven though so his past remains a mystery even to the lane hackers themselves.

			<div class="content"><b>Name:   </b> High Commander Apocalypse (is this an ok name?)
<br /><b>Age:   </b> 21
<br /><b>Position:   </b> Rogues Commander, The Feared One, The Bringer of Death, The Rogue Scythe
<br /><b>Faction:   </b> Liberty Rogues
<br /><b>Playing Style:   </b> Aggressive and Militaristic, always ready for a fight and more focused on military than trading.  He is kind and forgiving with his fellow Rogues and their allies, but he is merciless with Liberty.  Wants to expand the Rogues to become the greatest threat in all of Sirius.
<br /><b>Possible Allies:   </b> Outcasts, Lane Hackers, Xenos, Junkers
<br /><b>Possible Enemies:   </b> Liberty, Liberty Companies, Bounty Hunters Guild
<br /><b>History:   </b> Will Rettek was born and raised on Planet Los Angeles.  He had a happy life with his parents, his brother, and his sister.  One day while they were in the headquarters of the Liberty Navy on Los Angeles, where Will's father was bringing top-secret information from Ageira Technologies about new ship designs, they stumbled upon a secret military weapon being built.  Having seen to much, the navy officers fired upon Will and his family.  Will was able to escape alive by stealing a Liberty ship in the hangers, but his family was not so lucky.  They had all been killed at the hands of Liberty, and Will wanted revenge.  He joined up with the Liberty Rogues, and became such an excellent pilot and leader that he became the High Commander of the Rogues.  Leaving his old name behind, he took up the name &quot;Apocalypse&quot; and through his leadership the Rogues went form a minor nuisance to one of the biggest threats in all of Liberty.  He lifted the Rogues from the rule of the Outcasts, making Cardimine illegal for any Rogue to use.  He still wanted peace and friendliness with the Outcasts, but he did not believe in this drug and he knew that if the Cardimine usage inside the Rouges continued, they would become mere pawns to the Outcasts.  He also organised the Rogues, transforming them from a disorganised group of petty criminals to a organised group of dangerous pirates.  He also has given the Rogues training, because now with the Outcasts paying in credits instead of Cardimine, he can train his troops well and buy better ships and equipment.  He also hopes to expand the Rogues hand of friendship to the Xenos, knowing that they also oppose Liberty and could become a great ally to them.  He now strives to make the Rogues the largest power in all of Sirius, and to control all of Liberty.

			<div class="content">heehee roc that's very funny <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. BTW jacob--good idea to make people do this stuff now as opposed to at the END of the rpg. (hint CYOF 1...grrr <img src=smilies/icon_smile_evil.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )*
<br />
<br />ok, so here's my character info:
<br />
<br /><b>Name  </b>: Orion van Haalein
<br />
<br /><b>Age  </b>: 19
<br />
<br /><b>Position  </b>: Hessian Lord in Chief, head of the Red council**
<br />
<br /><b>Faction  </b>: Red Hessians
<br />
<br /><b>Playing Style  </b>: Haalein symbolizes in his actions the pinnacle of the contradiction Hessians have become known for in the past centuries. In his personal life, he is described as a moral, thoughtful person. No trace of this remains when the Hessian leader is seen in battle. In the true manner of the German-Russian hybrid he is, his strategy is that of offensive attack at any cost. Paying no attention to morals in battle, Haalein is ultimately only concerned with the result of a decisive attack. He takes great care, however, to pay attention to his bases' defensive capabilities, often masking them in nebulas and asteroid fields. Haalien prefers to use subtlety in politics (another contradiction to his thoughts towards battle), and refuses to trade overly much, rather constructing his own bases in resource-rich systems or attacking one in that system.
<br />
<br /><b>Possible Allies  </b>: Outcasts, Kusari, Bundschuh, LWB, Unioners, Corsairs, GMG***, Bretonia
<br />
<br /><b>Possible Enemies  </b>: Rhineland, GMG***, IMG, Kruger, Daumann, BHG, Zoners, Blood Dragons, GC
<br />
<br /><b>History  </b>: The young Orion van Haalein shocked the Hessian Underground when he volunteered himself to take over a missing seat in the Council at only 15, the former head of which had been hitting the booze a little too hard. Haalein had already proved himself in battle after conducting attack after attack on Solarius, resulting in the station's current vulnerability and deficiency. It became clear that the young man was a brilliant strategist, and although rash the Hessian faction grew tremendously under his reign. The last term he served on the council every public move he made was in preparation for the ultimate storm upon his enemies as he percieved it. Now having been not only re-elected but chosen to become the next Head of the Red Council, Haalein has every plan to put his preparations into action and bring screaming death upon those who oppose him. Orion is hailed constantly as shockingly ending the age-long war with the Corsairs, even resulting in what now seems like an alliance and a creation of a new league. (This move of course must be credited fully to Triyun as well, who put the deal forward). Haalein is haunted by the cruelty and cold capitalism of Rhineland and its corporations. His dream, inspired by the Corsair leaders, is to once and for all begin an alliance of the 3 strongest criminal factions in Sirius, and begin the creation of the Pirate's League, which would then bring down screaming death upon Rhineland and her corporations.
<br />Haalein is ready to discuss relations with any other criminal factions--Rogues, Xenos, and Hackers--except for Bretonian criminals, as the idyllic life of Bretonia has long been admired by the Hessians. Ultimately, his dream is to conquer .
<br />
<br />*I plan to play more with the faction than with the character, just so you all know.
<br />
<br />**I made all that up.
<br />
<br />***depending on which way the faction chooses to swing, we could be allies or enemies.

			<div class="content">Name: James Taylor
<br />Age: 26
<br />Title: Guildsmaster
<br />Faction: IMG
<br />Playing Style: believes best offence is defense, is ruthless with enemies if his systems become under attack, leans towards diplomacy to find solutions to the problems with hostiles
<br />Possible Allies: Bretonia, Rhineland, Bundschu, Xenos*
<br />Possible Enemies: Hessians*
<br />Character Background: James was one of the many new IMG space born children, they were born and raised in the far IMG outposts like Java, Falkland and Friestadt. As soon as he learned to fly James became an escort pilot, his biggest test came when his convoy was attacked by Sabers. Luckily for the convoy James was a good pilot and was able to distract the outcasts long enough for the transports to escape. This meant he was noticed by the Guildsmaster at the time and he began to train James to succeed him. During this time he over saw the research of the new IMG gunboats** and possibilities of refitting the hood. Unfortunately the old Guildsmaster was killed recently in an ambush by pirates and so James has risen to lead before his time. Despite being inexperienced the members of the IMG hold him in high regard and will follow his command. His first new initiative is to establish the IMG as a neutral faction, for now at least, while he rebuilds it from the shattered state it is in after the loss of its old, and much loved Guildsmaster.
<br />
<br />*According to what you&#8217;ve put down I will change as more people post and put me as enemy or ally
<br />
<br />**Well corporations get gunboats in this RPG so I thought I&#8217;d explain how I got them</div>
