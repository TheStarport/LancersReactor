			<div class="content">Sorry for the delay, but Chapter 19 is finally ready. Bottoms up!
<br />
<br />Chapter 19: Down But Not Out
<br />
<br />	It was a somber and silent group that landed on the battleship Isis. Orillion had made contact with the remaining Order battleship, which promptly set a course for New York to pick up the survivors of the Osiris. He had also contacted President Jacobi to notify her of what had happened.
<br />
<br />	Trent was still in a state of shock. The Order had just suffered a major defeat, and Trent was not accustomed to losing. He watched as two guards escorted Juni to the brig, and looked on as a medical team took King and the other casualties to the infirmary.
<br />
<br />	Orillion stood not far away coversing with the captain and senior officers of the Isis. It was difficult to read the expression on Orillion's face, but Trent guessed that Orillion was probably more pissed than anyone on board this ship and was determined to do something about it.
<br />
<br />	Trent decided that the best thing he needed was a drink, so he made a beeline for the bar. He was relieved to see that James Montgomery had already commandeered the bar and was mixing up the best drinks in Sirius.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hey, Trent, let me pour you one,&quot; James said as Trent came over. &quot;Sidewinder Fang on the house. And it's a double.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I could kiss you,&quot; Trent said, taking the drink, &quot;but I won't.&quot; He took a long pull at the glass.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So, my friend,&quot; James continued, &quot;what happens now?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know,&quot; Trent replied, &quot;but Orillion is right pissed. I just hope he doesn't decide to do something rash.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I wouldn't worry too much about that. I've known Casper Orrillion a long time, and one thing I know about him is he never makes a decision without carefully weighing the consequences, no matter how angry he is.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I hope you're right,&quot; Trent replied and gulped down the last of his drink. &quot;I think I'll go see how King's doing.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Tell him hello for me. After all,&quot; James said with a sly grin, &quot;he is my best customer.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Will do. Thanks for the drink.&quot; Trent turned and made his way to the infirmary. His thoughts were interrupted by an ethereal voice in his head.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Greetings once again, human.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent was surprised to be contacted by the Dom'Kavash yet again. He was even more surprised that it came without any of the side effects that he had previously experienced.
<br />
<br />	&quot;You know, you can call me Trent,&quot; he replied in his thoughts. &quot;That is my name. What should I call you?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We are not accustomed to addressing others by their names, but I will adapt to this custom if you wish. You may call me D'Ormaq.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What do you want?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I wish to inquire if you have accepted our request for your help in defeating our common enemy.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent thought out his response carefully, hoping that the Dom'Kavash didn't have the ability to read minds. &quot;I have passed along your request, and it is being considered.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I would recommend haste in this matter, Trent,&quot; the voice replied. &quot;It is only a matter of time before they will strike you again.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wait...how did you know?&quot;
<br />
<br />	There was no response. Wonderful, Trent thought to himself. At least I know his name now. He decided that his visit to King would have to wait, as Orillion would want to know of this. He made his way to the docking hangar and realized he had no idea where to find Orillion, as they were no longer on the Osiris. He decided to use his neural net to contact him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;This is Orillion,&quot; the terse voice replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion, it's Trent. I need to speak with you. It's very important.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Can it wait? I'm in the middle of a briefing.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's about the Dom'Kavash. They contacted me again.&quot;
<br />
<br />	It was a moment before Orillion replied. &quot;Meet me on the flight deck. I'll be right there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm already here. Trent out.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Orillion arrived a moment later.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What did they say?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Trent replied, &quot;except to tell me that the Nomads will strike us again very soon. And I got the name of our Dom'Kavash friend. He called himself D'Ormaq, or something.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Anything else?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, that was all.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;It's not much to go on. Do you still feel that they are hiding something?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes. Maybe it's just me, though.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, I hope to God I'm not selling the human race into slavery, but I don't think we have much of a choice but to help them.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You've got to be kidding.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The briefing I was just at provided some disturbing news. The Nomads are starting to come out in the open again. There have been scattered attacks in the Colonies, but they have all been repelled. I...&quot; Orillion was interrupted by the alarm klaxon.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Now what?&quot; Trent muttered. 
<br />
<br />	Orillion ran to a comm console. &quot;Bridge, what's happening?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We have multiple bogies inbound, closing fast. They're ignoring our hails.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Scramble the fighters. Battle stations,&quot; Orillion ordered. &quot;Let's go, Trent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	The flight deck became a flurry of activity as the flight crews prepped the fighters for launch as the pilots began their preflight checks. Within minutes the fighters were in space, and had engaged their cruise engines, flying on an intercept course with the incoming fighters. 
<br />
<br />	The dust and gas of the Badlands reduced visibility to nearly zero, and the scanners were nearly useless because of the radiation. Trent watched his HUD nervously as the distance closed between the Order ships and their unknown assailants. At that moment the dust cleared a little, and Trent felt an icy ball materialize in his stomach as the electric-blue shape of Nomad fighters became visible. Other ships followed the Nomads from the cloud, and Trent could pick out ships from every House in the armada.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Lock and load!&quot; Orillion's voice called out over the intercom. The Order ships broke formation and began to engage the Nomads. A space battle not seen since the Eighty Years' War unfolded amongst the dust, gas and asteroids of the Badlands.

			<div class="content">Here's chapter 20. Sorry about the wait.
<br />
<br />Chapter 20: Can't think of a good title for this one
<br />
<br />MEANWHILE...
<br />
<br />	President Jacobi sat in her makeshift office on West Point viewing the coded dispatch Orillion had sent to her. She could not believe what she was reading. Betrayal in the Order? The Osiris destroyed? More Nomad attacks? She sat back in her chair and sighed. She knew she needed to help Orillion in any way she could, but after what had happened with the alien dreadnought, her military advisors were constantly asking for more authority, and the threat of a coup was becoming a remote possibility. 
<br />
<br />	Jacobi closed her eyes abd put her hands over her face. Being president was a challenging job, to be sure, but this is not what she had in mind at all. She made a decision, sat up and pressed the comm button.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Commodore Jacobsen, could you come in for a moment please?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;On my way, Madam President.&quot;
<br />
<br />	He arrived a few moments later, flanked by three Liberty Navy officers.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Commodore, I want you to dispatch the battleships Dallas and Santa Fe to the Badlands. I want them to rendezvous with our friends there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I was hoping you wouldn't ask for that, Madam President,&quot; Jacobsen said as he produced a blaster pistol. The three officers did the same.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What the...&quot; Jacobi started.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm afraid I must ask you to come with us,&quot; Jacobsen continued. &quot;It is clear that your actions continue to put Liberty in jeopardy, and we cannot allow this any longer. If you cooperate, you will not be harmed. I'm sorry, Madam President.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I'm sure you are, you bastard,&quot; Jacobi hissed. She stood up as the Navy officers flanked her. Jacobsen led them out of the room. Suddenly two of the officers smashed the butts of their weapons on the back of Jacobsen's head and the remaining officer. Both crumpled to the ground.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Madam President, please come with us,&quot; said one of the officers.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wait, who are you?&quot; Jacobi demanded.
<br />
<br />	&quot;We're with the Order. Jacobsen is a member of the Sirius Covenant, a group fighting the Dom'Kavash. We'll explain everything later. We have a ship standing by. We have to hurry.&quot;
<br />
<br />--------------------------------
<br />
<br />	The battle in the Badlands was becoming a slaughter on both sides. The Order ships were outnumbered nearly three to one, but had managed to inflict heavy losses on the attacking ships. 
<br />
<br />	Trent circled the battle, recharging his shields. He claimed credit for four kills, and it looked like the Order just might win this one. His optimism turned into despair as three Nomad battleships decloaked and entered the battle. He cursed, punched his thrusters and returned to the battle.
<br />
<br />	The Order ships began taking a beating from the newly arrived battleships, and Orillion ordered the ships to concentrate their fire on them. Trent acknowledged the order and turned to engage when a familiar voice came over the comm system.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I thought a little help would be in order, my friends,&quot; Von Claussen said. Trent looked as ten Rheinland Valkyries emerged from out of a pocket of dust and joined the battle. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Bundschuh offers its assistance,&quot; Von Claussen said.
<br />
<br />	&quot;And I couldn't be happier to see you,&quot; Orillion replied. &quot;Take out the battleships. The rest of us will dispatch the fighters.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Acknowledged. All Bundschuh craft engage!&quot; The Valkyries attacked the battleships with precision. Within moments two were completely destroyed and the third was heavily damaged. Orillion's group had taken care of most of the remaining fighters when four more Nomad battleships decloaked and launched more Nomad fighters.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh, this is not happening!&quot; Trent said angrily. What he saw next made his jaw drop. 
<br />
<br />	From out of nowhere a giant spacecraft appeared, and Trent recognized it instantly as the Dom'Kavash dreadnought. 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Oh...&quot; Orillion started to say
<br />
<br />	&quot;Everyone back away!&quot; Trent called out. The Order ships moved away from the approaching ship. Trent watched in awe as massive beams of leathal blue light shot out and struck the Nomad battleships. Several triangle-shaped ships, bluish in color, emerged from the Dom'Kavash ship and engaged the fighters.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What do we do?&quot; Trent asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I think the Dom'Kavash just saved our asses,&quot; Orillion said in a rare display of profanity. &quot;I think our objective is pretty clear.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You're the boss. Tally-ho!&quot; Trent called as he engaged his thrusters and began to engage the Nomads once again. He piloted his Eagle in close to one of the Nomad battleships and fired a long burst from his cannons, heavily damaging the battleship. He pulled up to escape the explosions, and a Nomad fighter closed in on him, firing its own guns. Trent's shields sputtered and sparked with the impact of the energy, and he spun his Eagle into a tight turn, chopping power to his engines to make the turn sharper. He managed to get the Nomad in his sights and fired off his own cannons, but the shots went wide. He pursued the Nomad, only to have his target destroyed by a Dom'Kavash fighter. The alien craft zoomed away, and Trent was momentarily distracted as he watched the graceful spacecraft instantly dispatch another Nomad. He was brought back to reality by the impact of more Nomad guns on his shields.
<br />
<br />	The battle was over in a matter of minutes. The Dom'Kavash fighters had made short work of the Nomads, and the battleships could not withstand the intense firepower of the Dom'Kavash dreadnought. The remaining Order ships had gathered at a safe distance from the Dom'Kavash, waiting for the next move.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Talk to me, Trent,&quot; Orillion said.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Hey, I'm just as confused as you. They haven't said anything to me yet.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Then, just as quickly as it had come, the Dom'Kavash vessel disappeared in a flash of light.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------
<br />
<br />	Trent walked across the flight deck to Orillion, who was waiting for him.
<br />
<br />	&quot;So they didn't contact you at all?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;No, sir. I'm kind of surprised myself.&quot;
<br />
<br />	They were joined by the communications officer of the Isis.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Sir, we just received a transmission from President Jacobi. Apparently there's been a coup in Liberty, and she has been removed from office. She's on her way here.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;The news just keeps getting better,&quot; Orillion muttered. &quot;ETA?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Twenty minutes out.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very well. Let me know when she gets here.&quot;
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------
<br />
<br />	President Jacobi arrived some minutes later in a modified Dromedary freighter, accompanied by two Liberty battleships and thirty fighters. Apparently Jacobi still had some connections with those still lotal to her.
<br />
<br />	Orillion, Trent and Jacobi sat around the conference table in the briefing room.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Apparently not everyone in Liberty thinks the Dom'Kavash are evil,&quot; Orillion pointed out. &quot;However, we also have some doubts of their real intentions.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jacobi asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;The Dom'Kavash have established some kind of mental link with Colonel Trent, and he has been in sporadic contact with them.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What are their intentions?&quot; Jacobi asked.
<br />
<br />	&quot;All I know is that they want our help in wiping out the Nomads,&quot; Trent replied, &quot;but I think they're hiding something.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know. It's like they're holding something back. I can feel it.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Jacobi was silent for a moment. &quot;Do you think this 'mental link' between you and the Dom'Kavash is two-way? Could you initiate contact with them?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know. I've never tried it, and I don't even know how I would do that.&quot; 
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well, my suggestion to you, Mr. Trent, is to find a way. We need to know what they're really up to. In the meantime, I would suggest moving as far away from here as possible. Do you have any destinations in mind, Orillion?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes. I'm taking us back to Toledo. We need some serious repairs, and we need to come up with a plan.&quot;

			<div class="content">In case anyone is still reading this, here's chapter 21.
<br />
<br />Chapter 21: Communication With The Dom'Kavsh
<br />
<br />	The Isis and the Liberty battleships escorting her entered parking orbit over Toledo. Immediately fighters began launching to the surface to begin the long process of repair and refit. Trent followed the first wave down in his Eagle, thinking about what Jacobi had said. Could he initiate contact with the Dom'Kavash? It was a scary idea, he thought to himself as he set the Eagle down on one of the landing pads, but I may have no other choice.
<br />
<br />	As he walked to his temporary quarters he thought about the experience he had had with the two Rheinlanders nearly two years ago who had led him to Von Claussen during the first Nomad encounter. He knew that the strange silent one had somehow peered into his mind to determine if he could be trusted. How had he done that? 
<br />
<br />	Trent arrived at his quarters, threw his duffel bag on the bunk and closed the door. He slumped down in a chair, closed his eyes and tried to relax. He focused his thoughts on the Dom'Kavash, trying to extend his consciousness outward and feeling particularly stupid about it. 
<br />
<br />	Suddenly a flash of light engulfed him and when the light faded Trent found himself no longer in his quarters. He had no idea where he was, or even how he got there.
<br />
<br />	The room he now found himself in was dimly lit in an eerie blue, and appeared to be some kind of command center.  Several robed figures moved around him, chattering in a language he could not understand, yet was strangely familiar. Trent searched his mind, trying to figure out where he had heard the chattering language before. 
<br />
<br />	One of the strange figures moved closer and Trent was able to get a better view. His curiosity turned to shock as the insectlike creature began to speak to him, and Trent realized that even though he did not know the language, he understood the words.
<br />
<br />	&quot;My Lord, the humans have retreated to the K'Tashiqa system. They appear to have a base there.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What of their military strength?&quot; The voice surprised Trent, and he realized that the creature was was not addressing him directly. He was in fact inside the mind of a Dom'Kavash, but which one? And did they know he was here?
<br />
<br />	&quot;They appear to have three capital ships, and a number of small fighters. They appear to be of little threat. How can these creatures possibly help us?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I have watched them in battle, and despite their few numbers they have proven extremely resourceful against our enemies. It would be advantageous to seek them as allies, but they have been reluctant to accept our offer. Perhaps after our intervention they will be more willing to acquiese.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;What will happen to these humans after we have defeated our enemies?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Regardless of their choice, they will be dealt with appropriately. Thank you, that will be all.&quot; The Dom'Kavash bowed and walked away.
<br />
<br />	Trent's mind was moving at the speed of light. What exactly did 'dealt with' mean? He knew he had to tell Orillion and the Order about this, but how as he supposed to get out of the head of a Dom'Kavash?
<br />
<br />	He remembered what he was doing when he had made contact with the Dom'Kavash. What the hell, he thought to himself as he tried to relax and extend his consciousness out...
<br />
<br />	He suddenly found himself back in his quarters, bathed in sweat and shaking slightly. A wave of nausea overcame him, and he stumbled into the bathroom just as his stomach began to heave. After it was all over he stood up slowly and moved over to his bunk, crashing down upon it. He put his hands over his face and tried to comprehend what he had just seen. He must have probed into the mind of the Dom'Kavash known as D'Ormaq, and this D'Ormaq obviously was in some kind of leadership role. Could this Dom'Kavash even be the leader of them all?
<br />
<br />	He reached over and activated his communication console.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion, I need to see you immediately.&quot;
<br />
<br />------------------------
<br />	
<br />	Orillion and President Jacobi listened as Trent related the events he had just witnessed.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Well,&quot; Jacobi said after Trent had finished, &quot;this gives us a unique advantage. Are you sure this Dom'Kavash had no idea you were inside his head?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I don't know that for sure, but he made no indication he was aware of my...presence,&quot; Trent replied.
<br />
<br />	&quot;This is an unexpected change in our fortunes,&quot; Orillion said, &quot;but unfortunately it still doesn't clear up the issue of the Dom'Kavash intentions for us.&quot; Orillion was silent for a moment, as if contemplating what to do next. &quot;What I am about to do will either be the decision that saves humanity or enslaves it. Trent, the next time the Dom'Kavash contact you, tell them we will assist them in any way we can. I agree with President Jacobi's thoughts---this gives us an advantage, as we may be able to determine their true motives. Do you concur, Madam President?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;You've never led us astray, Orillion. I concur with your decision.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Very well. Trent, I want you to report to the medical wing. You look like hell, and I need you healthy. I may have to ask you to make contact with them again very soon.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I understand,&quot; Trent replied, not too enthusiastically.
<br />
<br />	&quot;One other thing: what you have told us here does not leave this room. I will inform Dr. Quintaine of these events, but no one else is to know of this. Is that clear?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />
<br />---------------------------
<br />
<br />	&quot;You're a little dehydrated, but otherwise you're in good shape. It looks like you've been suffering from simple exhaustion,&quot; the medical officer on watch said. &quot;You need some serious rest.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Just making sure. Thanks, Doc.&quot; Trent left the medical wing and started back for his quarters.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Greetings, Trent.&quot; The voice had returned.
<br />
<br />	&quot;I was wondering when you would contact me again. I wish to thank you for your help in fighting the Nomads.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I hope our goodwill gesture has assisted in making your decision.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;We will help in any way we can.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;I am pleased to hear that.&quot;
<br />
<br />	Trent had an idea. &quot;Perhaps it would be prudent for us to meet in person, to discuss a battle strategy.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;That may be possible at a future time, but for now we do not feel the need to do so. We will contact you again when we are ready. Farewell for now, Trent.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Wait...&quot; But the voice was gone.
<br />
<br />	Trent cursed to himself and went to find Orillion. He arrived on the Operations level to find it abuzz with activity.
<br />
<br />	&quot;What's going on?&quot; Trent asked Von Claussen, who was giving orders to the Ops crew.
<br />
<br />	&quot;It would appear that something has happend on Sprague,&quot; Von Claussen replied. Dr. Quintaine reports that the dig has suddenly come to life. Artifacts are activating themselves all over the planet.&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Where is Orillion?&quot;
<br />
<br />	&quot;Right here,&quot; Orillion said behind them as he walked up.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Orillion, I need to discuss something with you,&quot; Trent said.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Von Claussen, keep me posted on what's happening on Sprague. Tell Dr. Quintaine I want him out of there as soon as possible. Come with me, Trent.&quot; Orillion and Trent walked over to a corner and Trent related the latest information he had received.
<br />
<br />	&quot;Trent, I need you to try and contact them again. We have to find out what is going on. Meet me in my office in ten minutes. Jacobi will be there too. I'm also going to have medical personnel on hand as well. I don't want you dying on me.&quot; Orillion smiled ever so slightly.
