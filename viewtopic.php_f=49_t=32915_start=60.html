			<div class="content">The President got the report he dreaded. The itinerary he had in his quarters was gone. Now they knew his destinations. The Tawsburg stop was ok, but the others were in jeopardy. He would have no choice but to stop the trip and return to Washington. He would still go through with the next stop and visit the town as planed. Tawsburg had impressed him very much with its courage and fortitude. He wanted to meet these kinds of people. People with heart.
<br />
<br />Tawsburg was ready as far as water and wood goes, the protection was in place. They would use the barricades again like they did when they faced the gang. Bargib had everything in place including a few surprises, thanks to the information from Locutus. 
<br />*
<br />The train continued its climb up from the plains area. The engin working as hard as the Presidents mind. Thoughts churning away to deal with this betrayal. The army detachment had the means of defending the train, even while moving. The cannons could blast any barricade of the tracts. The troops, well trained for close combat. Part of a new bread of soldier. 
<br />
<br />Bargib held a meeting of his deputies and Fear Factor. He had them al squared away in what to do. He hoped the presence of so many men would detour any confrontation. He was close to being right. The only one who was sweating was Locutus. His family was safe, but he was not. The government may not let him off the hook, but more over the &#8220;group&#8221; would not let him off. They lost their leverage, but not their anger.
<br />
<br />Kelsy decide, he had had enough. He wanted to get payed, but not at this expense. He gave the men a new destination to head to, one well out of range of the target and one that he could be away from when it all went south. He grabbed the saddle horn and swung of the saddle and reached for the reins. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see Tom, till I get back, hold position here&#8221; he spoke to the second in command. The man nodded. 
<br />
<br />sw was enjoying watching the construction. An hour into watching, she go a pad of paper out and started writing. Ideas for a story no doubt. She always got her inspiration this way, first hand. She loved life and saw many things in it worth writing about. The beauty in the things around her, intrigued her so much. Kind of like Wolfy intrigued her. But that would be another story. 
<br />
<br />Tom looked through the glass. He was not sure he believed what he saw. The station had close to thirty men on it and in the distance, he saw the dust cloud of th U.S. Cavalry coming that way. That meant the town had word of the plan. His orders were explicit. He had to abort. If he could not assured of victory, he was to stop before engaging. The plot could not be exposed till after it was completed. He swore, looked through the glass again and swore a second time. This would not go well with him and the group. They would want his head for word getting out. He rounded up the commanders and informed them the plan was cancelled and to inform their men that they were to leave the area. All had returned at the appointed time except for Kelsy. Was he the weak link? Was he the one that had gotten them word of what the plan was? He flung his hat at the ground.
<br />
<br />The train slowed as it neared the platform. All troops and men at the ready. But no trouble was seen. Bargib and the deputies were on horse back rifles in hand. The others were spaced up and down the track on both sides, weapons at the ready. The engine slowed to a stop under the water tower and then stopped. The engineer released the steam so they could take on water. This was when they would be the most vulnerable.

			<div class="content">The Conclusion-
<br />
<br />The train slowed as it neared the platform. All troops and men at the ready. But no trouble was seen. Bargib and the deputies were on horse back rifles in hand. The others were spaced up and down the track on both sides, weapons at the ready. The engine slowed to a stop under the water tower and then stopped. The engineer released the steam so they could take on water. This was when they would be the most vulnerable. 
<br />
<br />The president looked out the windows at the last bit of movement of the train, stopped. He had many he wanted to meet here. This town was a hero, dealing with a large outlaw gang by themselves. He had got the true word from a Marshal named Locutus and verified by Fear Factor. Rumors were rampant on what had happened. But in the end, the truth was an interesting read. These people, never gave up, never turned and ran in fear. He knew the struggle there was in living in the wild west, but this, this was a true tale of the mighty spirit of man over their enemies. A tale he hoped to see in print one day.
<br />
<br />Bargib had his deputies in a row. All dresses smartly and presentable. This was a high honor. To meet one who ruled a country, who governed men in a just way, different that any other in the world. Bargib motioned for locutus and Fear Factor to move up. He and they dismounted and moved toward the platform. The Army soldiers that were sent for, formed a perimeter on the other side of the train. They knew little of who was on the train, only that they were needed there quickly. They were surprised to learn that it was the President of the United States on the train.
<br />
<br />Fear Factor took the lead and led Bargib and company to the steps of the train. &#8220;Mr. President, it&#8217;s good to see you again Sir&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see you again, my old friend.&#8221; The president responded.
<br />
<br />&#8220;May I introduce Bargib, the town Sheriff fo Tawsburg&#8221; Fear Factor spoke gesturing to Bargib as he moved up to shake hands.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It is an honor to meet you, Mr. President&#8221; Bargib responded.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, the honor is mine&#8221; the president replied with a grin, &#8220;To meet people who used wisdom and cunning to stand up to such a large gang of outlaws.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Bargib and company gave the President a tour of the town with a stop at the school house. sw nearly fell on her seat when she saw the president. She did a little curtsy for him and they talked a little and her stories came up. Before leaving town, she had given him a copy of two of the stories for him to read on the way back to Washington. The President saw so much of the people of the town, the growth it had in the last ten years was amazing. He was impressed with Baked Potato&#8217;s download. It was an assume display of wares that he had ever seen. 
<br />
<br />The train was turned around during the tour so that when the President was ready to leave, it would create little problem. With the change in the itinerary, he believed there would be no problems on the return trip.
<br />
<br />Most of the town turned out to see him off. His humanity and humility had won many of them over. But, now the town would return to their simple ways, if anything could truly be called simple. Locutus decided to move his family here permanently and kept the Marshals position as well.
