			<div class="content">As of tonight, 24/7 Seattle Based is going for the most part offline.
<br />
<br />When the patch from DA is released I will consider bringing it back online.
<br />
<br />There are a lot of reasons involved, but suffice to say, it wasn't just the cheaters and hackers.
<br />
<br />I will be deleting all accounts tonight, and if and when it comes online it will be a fresh start for all and hopefully in a state that will greatly restrict cheaters/hackers.
<br />
<br />Thanks for playing on my server for those that enjoyed it.
<br />
<br />To those that abused it, I hope that you learn you lifes lessons before you try to act like you did on the internet in real life and suffer real life consequences.

			<div class="content">Oh man, hope the patch is coming our way too <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />A good idea to start over again. I will do that too on my server. Hope this will make a start to shut down cheaters <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I will delete all accounts too on my server when the patch arrives.
<br />
<br />A pity that every account has it's own directory. This slows down my system a bit when it is accessing accounts. Liked to see one big file which handles all accounts.
<br />
<br />Hope that after installing the patch in the feature, that cheaters would be excluded and that excluding cheaters also does good to the server's runtime.
<br />
<br />Have much freelancer fun,

			<div class="content">FYI
<br />
<br />Freelancer servers are run by people like me
<br />
<br />People like me utilize the bandwidth I PAY for, to provide a FREE service to those that enjoy the game.
<br />
<br />We do this when we can, because we can, and we enjoy doing it.
<br />
<br />In my case, as is the case I imagine with many an administrator for many a Game Server (not just freelance), if hosting the game becomes to much of a pain in the neck, then it is no longer in the interest of the host to continue hosting.
<br />
<br />In my case, between the cheaters/hackers and personal priorties, I am no longer able to give the server the attention it needs.  If the patch resolves the cheater/hacker issues, and I get my personal life (ya know, the one some of us have outside of our virtual universe), then I will reconsider hosting the game, once again, using my paid for bandwidth for free to the likes of you.
<br />
<br />Honestly, I don't care about the time you spent raking up millions of credits, ect...  You are lucky that you had my free server in the first place to enjoy playing on.  I know most people that played on the server were happy just to have a good server to play on while it was there.  Ya it sucks that I had to take it down for now, I know this.  But at least be happy that it was there while it was, and move on.
<br />
<br />I am sure there are quite a few server admins that would happily have you play on thier servers (assuming you don't cheat/mod/hack)  Check out the other TRL servers (argonis and Elite).

			<div class="content">First of all, I mean no offense.  Genedefect you run the server so if you feel fit to take it down, that's your business.  But really, I felt the need to post simply because to me it is a major annoyance.  My buddy and I both live in the Seattle area (Mountlake Terrace and Bothell incase you were curious) and actually both have the same DSL service as you and must be on the same network.  Meaning, your server has an outstanding ping for us.  You must live right around the corner or something, because late at night (around 3 or 4am) your server goes down right when my dsl goes down, which leads me to believe we are on the same DSL network or something and they are updating something.  But anyhow.  Both my friend and I have only been playing for a couple weeks and this game truely kicks butt.  It's such a fun game.  As soon as we found multiplayer, we found absolutely no need to play singleplayer.  So, in the couple weeks we have been playing, we have probably been on 2 or 3 different servers, spent hours playing to get money only to see the server disappear.  You probably don't realize how annoying that is unless you actually play the game.  So that brought us to the 24/7 Seattle Server which was perfect for us.  So lets see, the main objective of the game seems to be to build your ship up to max potential.  So we started out getting money running missions... eventually getting enough so we could buy a freighter.  Then he was my wingman while I traded goods to try to get enough money to buy some cool ships.  Do you realize how boring being a freighter is?... I spent hours and hours trading goods with that hunk of crap ship just so I could have the big payday and be able to buy an Eagle or something.  The ends would justify the means.  So eventually we saved up our millions and went to get the cool ships.  We bought a couple Eagles and then went out looking for wrecks and killing nomads so we could get some sweet weapons.  OUr eventual goal after maxing out our ships was probably just to go around and pirate ships or something.  Who knows.  But my point is, we spent about 15 tedious hours on that server and had finally got our ships maxed out when suddenly you decide to take the server down because of hackers and cheaters.  
<br />
<br />Honestly, I think I saw a cheater only once while playing on that server.  He was in New York and was shooting some nomad lasers so originally I thought maybe the server was a mod or something and you could get the lasers. So I asked about 20 people in the server if it was modded and they said they didn't think so and that I must have been mistaken if i saw someone with nomad lasers.  So what does that prove?... i guess it proves that some people aren't even aware of there being an existence of cheaters.  Also, how is it that cheating and hacking is such a problem, but my friend and I never even had the slightest issue with them.  Really now, I don't even see how a cheater or hacker could ruin my experience.  I don't give a darn about what those fools wanna do as long as my buddy and I can use a server to do our thing.  The only real contact I had with cheaters I guess was probably when I asked some 38's where a particular jumphole was (possibly one of them was a cheater?).  
<br />
<br />Anyhow, i'm just venting... this is terribly irritating to spend hours and hours building an account only to see the server turn off for what I perceive as nothing.  I can understand that it's a sacrifice on your bandwidth and whatnot to be running the server, but honestly if you aren't prepared to do it... don't freaking host a server.   I've got the same DSL service as you, and you don't see me hosting a server... cuz I don't want to.  Also a couple days ago my friend and I thought we were banned, because we couldn't get into the server and we came onto this forum and saw someone complaining about you genedefect saying that you ban some people for stupid reasons... like having nicknames you don't agree with.  So my friend and I were perplexed as to why on earth you would have banned us and came to the conclusion that you must be some kind of power tripping arrogant punk of a person who likes to set up servers and then ban people to show your &quot;power&quot;.  Of course, we eventually realized that we weren't banned when we saw your other post gloating that you had some 4500 people registered on your server or something and you saying you were taking the server down.
<br />
<br />Really how difficult is it to set up a server?  Why are cheaters and hackers such a problem?  They don't inconvience the players (such as my friend and I) so what is the problem?  I hear they slow down the server.... i never experienced any lag... and if i did it was because the server was just loaded with many many people.  
<br />
<br />So anyhow, i'm just talking a bunch of randomness, but we truely are very irritated with this.  Both my friend and I are done with Freelancer.  The fun was being able to go around and build up our ships and our accounts to powerful levels and then being able to be pirates or whatever we chose fit to do.  The fact that we've built up our accounts in 3 different servers in a couple weeks only to see those servers go down (in 2 weeks!?? JEEZE... can't the servers last more than a couple weeks???) are a real turnoff for this game.  Why on earth would we spend hours and hours of our life playing this game if our accounts could be deleted any time... it's crap like this that makes me want to figure out how to cheat so i don't have to spend hours in order to have millions.  Why invest my time into a server if they do something like this.  And of course, if we did decide to play again, there would be no way in hell we would EVER go and play on that Seattle server... you've ruined our playing experience.  
<br />
<br />Just thought you, and other server admins, might want to know how a legit player feels about it.  Again, it's your server and you can do what you wanna do, but it's terribly annoying and irritating and I'm sure you've lost a lot of respect from legit players who could possibly rejoin your server when you relaunch (and i'm sure you care about that since you were gloating about your 4500 users).    Peace out.

			<div class="content">Really now, genedefect.  What is our motivation in the first place in hosting a server?  What do you gain by doing it?  Honestly whatever your motivation was or is, it doesn't really matter.  The only reason I had decided to play hours and hours on your server is because I spoke with some people on other servers and was told that the Seattle server was stable.  This is a game.... this is a game with a sweet multiplayer feature.  And the multiplayer feature stores your account information on different servers.  The goal of the multiplayer feature is to build up your account.  So being a game player, my primary interest in picking a server is for it to be a stable server that will be 24/7 and will not turn off and delete my account.  That's it.  So if you or any other server admins out there are not prepared to meet those simple qualifications, then please do all legit players in the community a big favor and stop hosting a server.  It's so irritating to see this happen.</div>

			<div class="content">Just because you haven't been affected by cheaters, doesn't mean it's not a problem.  I'll never forget the incident around Manhattan when that b****** &quot;\/ex&quot; camped with his hacked ship, killing everyone in the area.  Then to make matters worse, 2 days later someone else did the exact same thing.  So if genedefect feels that doing a server wipe will help in the cheat prevention, I'm all for it.  When it comes to 'expliting power', that would apply to those damn cheaters.  The ones that cause a lot of grief, and after being banned, they take a few simple steps and they're suddenly back, causing havoc again!  <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />BTW, I lost a lot aswell, but you don't hear me complaining.  I had an Eagle, lvl10 weapons/shields as well as Ripper mines and Sunslayers (x50 of both).  I think it only takes a few days to build up a character...and I doubt there's a server out there that's lasted longer before starting over or going down permenantly.  So don't blame genedefect for something that's obviously a Freelancer CONSTANT.  Remember, no matter how good someone's computer or internet connection is, they're all running the same crappy, unstable server program.

			<div class="content">I cancelled the mod as I had to refocus my time back on work and since mods can't be deployed from server to client, it is a pain to have all the users acquire the mod kit.
<br />
<br />The character wipe is mainly done pending the DA patch for FLServer since the updated FLServer does change some of the dynamics around max rank and cred requirements.
<br />
<br />I am glad you and your friend enjoyed my server while it was up.  It's not that running a server is all that hard, it is maintaining a poorly written server that has an enourmous Modder/Hacker/Cheater problem.  That is where the time aspect comes into play.
<br />
<br />Lets see, I can spend 2 hours a night tracking down and banning Modders/Cheaters/Hackers or I can actually get a full 8 hours sleep.  Well I chose the latter as lack of sleep has been impacting both work and personal life.
<br />
<br />I did my best to keep the server up as long as I could.  Keeping in mind that there were major stability and performance issues after I broke 3000 accounts, a couple of possiblites that I weighed before I took it down were
<br />
<br />1) Get a couple of remote admins
<br />1a) I decided not to do this on the grounds that I do have some private information stored on the same system that I ran FLServer on
<br />
<br />2) Password server and only let existing accounts keep playing
<br />2a) Still would have huge stability issues due to # of players
<br />
<br />3) Wipe all accounts and password and only allow those that I sent password to play
<br />3a) Even more time required than just banning bad players each night
<br />
<br />4) Take down server for ever
<br />4a) Really don't want to do this as it is a fun game and I do have a great machine and nice business DSL line I can run it on
<br />
<br />5) Take down server till patch and keep all current accounts
<br />5a) This was an option I seriously considered, but if they didn't fix the stability issues it would be worthless.  Also with the various gameplay modifications and rank modifications coming, this would potentially cause problems
<br />
<br />6) Take down server, wipe all accounts, and bring back after Server patch
<br />6a) This was the best option I could come up with.  Yes players loose thier accounts, but with the new anti cheater/hacker/modder code in the patch, this will balence the game better from the start.  This also guarentees no stability issues from the point the patch is released till at least 1 - 2 months out when I get back to around 3000 accounts.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope that when the server comes back online people have more fun than they used to due to the decrease in cheaters/hackers/modders.
<br />
<br />Also to comment on the lag caused by cheaters/hackers/modders, just because you don't see it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  On several occassions I have seen the msec of lag on my server drop by 5 - 10 upon banning a blatent cheater that was logged in.</div>
