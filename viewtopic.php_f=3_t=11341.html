			<div class="content">Ok, Don't take this the wrong way, I absolutely love this game, and still play it overtime ever since the day i bought it. I have a Sabre, with all the works on it (unlike most people, i didnt rush to get here, took my time as a trader and in the last second switched to a fighter and a criminal) but, albeit i still have plenty of fun causing chaos in the house systems, attacking lone stations and wings of fighters, and finding my eyes glaring with joy every time i take out a freight train (my personal favorite is to fly close to it capital-ship-attack style and torpedo bomb it as i pass). But I sometimes find myself in dire need of more high level content, albeit nomads can still be challenging in large enough packs, they arent as deadly if you have any flight skill whatsoever. So, I slowly drift into the abyss of just simply wanting more of a challenge out of this game. They dont need to change any of the ships, or the levels or anything, just add more things to fight.
<br />
<br />If any here have ever played Diablo 2: Lord Of Destruction you should know by now, even with a very high level character (i myself have a level 82 sorceress) still find Hell Difficulty hard as well......hell. I was hoping for something like this in freelancer, maybe just a few of those systems where even a guy in a fighter like mine with similar equipment will still have a hard time surviving. But this would be a complicated addition, they would not only have to add enemies and bases that are a challenge, but a sufficient enough reward for a person to stand tall in those challenges. So I was flying around assaulting random GMG Falcon Wings and finaly thought up of something.
<br />
<br />Instead of the small, and sometimes big scale battles you see around space all the time, have 2-3 systems, where theres a heavy war going on between 2 houses (im talking large scale, hundreds of fighters, battleships, stations being built and destroyed, and everything being able to be shot down) this way, lets say Liberty and Rheinland fight over New York (just a example) a large scale, 2 stations spawn on each end of the systems, each launching fighters and commisioning battleships, soon, the war erupts outside and everywhere, full, head on war, depending on color coded seriousness such as &quot;Green/Yellow/Orange/Red&quot; each causing different amounts of ships, by both level, equipment and scale to be involved.
<br />
<br />A Green war would have 2 battleships opposing each other with the help of fighters, and then a player comes in and helps with the fighters and maybe get a little tangle in with the capships and help one side turn the tide. While in a Red War, there would be 20+ battleships all over the map, all fighting for a different part of the map. Then, around these ships, there would be a small area where a player could enter, which would count as participating in the battle, the player then gets periodical orders from squad leaders, such as &quot;Take Out those fighters!&quot; or &quot;scuttle the big ships lets send em limpin back!&quot; and each time a player has a certain time limit to accomplish a certain amount of either damage (capships) or kills (fighters) to be given a &quot;Good Job&quot; in the battle, these would be counted on the cockpit, next to the actual glass maybe 2 little black axes crossed and have a number under it such as:
<br />
<br />                                        ()  ()
<br />                                           X
<br />                                         /                                           10000
<br />
<br />(Excuse the bad example, im trying to get my point across, not show off my artistic talent). So this ranks the player in how many large scale battles hes been in, and how good he did. A war would require 2 different factions to be owning systems right next to each other, so one faction decides to invade, and on the opposing houses turf is where the war takes place. So say for example, Liberty and Kusari are in a scrap, and Kusari decides to invade one of liberties systems, lets just say Texas (not sure if its next to kusari, dont care really) so now, in texas a war of a certain scale takes places depending on the combined power of the 2 houses. About the 2 bases, these would be heavily defended (im talking about 10-12 weapons platforms with better armament depending on level war) and bases, with their own defensive wings. These &quot;Wars&quot; would be very rare (im talking anywhere from 1 week to 1 month in between each) and under the circumstances.
<br />
<br />All commodities sold at all bases in those sectors are immediately something like doubled, because its harder to get supplies across with a large scale war going on. And, this has to involve players, huge battles around heavily trafficked stations would be nice, so whens theres a war going on, you know it. A war could last anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 week, depending on level and power of houses, it would go on until a time limit (7 days until its a draw) and would end when one side loses the base, or simply surrenders to overwhelming odds, afterwards, the base that won simply &quot;disappears&quot; and the base that lost is destroyed in the attack, in this manner, some systems would goto war, and players would be inspired to get involved, wether simply bias to a faction, are bored of watching the killing, or simply want to return everything to normal. Again, these wars would be very rare, and each war would change prices on commodities by a little tiny bit, depending on what commodity or place.
<br />
<br />So a red scale war over new berlin would make diamonds in berlin sell for 100 credits higher or someting (there would be a limit of 2 consecutive positive for negative changes for any one commodity for 2 wars in a row), this way, not only do they implement a dynamic economy, but also include large scale space battles, and competition over sectors to inspire players to get involved and play, either just for rank or for fun, so on a server where theres a war goin on for 7 days, you and your friend could sign on, talk over the phone as you cooperatively help turn the tide of the battle to one faction or another, eventually one wins, so people will want to get together, and feel like their making a change in the galaxy. Depending on the systems their fighting over, theres different level fighters involved, in a minor scrap between say bretonia and liberty, there would be patriors, rhinos on liberty and bretonia would have a large variety of fighters, each toned down to make the war be a little more exciting, not to mention fair. Enjoy the read (i hope) just a random thing i was coming up with while i was playing yesterday.
<br />
<br />And even wars with a green scale should be somewhat hard due to the capital ships, frigates, and overhwelming numbers of fighters flying around. Hence the name High Level Content. There would also have to be a payoff in level, rank, money, or equipment of some kind, so people actually get something for risking their lives for the good of their house.
<br />

			<div class="content">Wow.  
<br />This mod/addon would be awesome.  My favorite SP missions were always the totally crazy ones, with battleships and fighters and all the rest going all over the place, which is how I think these wars would be.
<br />An idea: In border systems, instead of two houses fighting, you could have a house fighting a group of criminals, or maybe a couple of groups that banded together for the war.  Nothing says that the pirates couldn't get their hands on the plans for a battleship and build a few of them.   
<br />I think this would be a great addition to the game, and it would give it a good mercenary slant for those who wanted it.</div>
