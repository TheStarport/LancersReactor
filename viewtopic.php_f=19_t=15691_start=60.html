			<div class="content">Oh.
<br />My.
<br />God.
<br />
<br />That was the most sappy, biased form of &quot;role playing&quot; that I have ever had to witness.
<br />
<br />Yeah..they were distracted by the lack of &quot;leadership&quot;?
<br />
<br />We don't *need* leadership to kill one incompetent Eagle pilot, and how long do you think they were &quot;confused&quot; before I hit the respawn button?
<br />
<br />Oh please. That bit about things being on the rise for OWL cracked me up. You're the only OWL member who's probably even there, and if Cleaver's BS here is even halfway true, the rest of them are in hiding ( which I seriously doubt, you guys have been saying this crap for 3 days and we've never been &quot;ambushed&quot; ).
<br />
<br />You mean, playing the game, but restricting yourself to doing crappy missions in Liberty so you don't actually have to fight any of us. Loved the shots of you getting owned by Dark, BTW <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I'm starting to get this now. You guys think you're heroes, &quot;defenders&quot; of Elite. I want you to do something for me. I want you to step outside for one quick moment, take a deep breath of the nice, cool air - and remind yourself that you are playing a *game*, please. 
<br />
<br />None of them waited for you, fool. It's pretty obvious when someone relogs, and they promptly proceeded to inform me of the name change so I could have everyone keep an eye on you.
<br />
<br />Feel free to continue stroking Alpha's genital areas.
<br />
<br />Sigh. I remember when this place used to be civilized, and hadn't yet been infiltrated by hordes of newbies with heroic dreams of leading a clan in multiplayer.

<br />Well obviously they need leadership. You know, someone to hold a flag and call them all to gather at one point? Once you we're gone, the rest where pretty easy to destroy, even though I was outnumbered and had those damn bounty hunters shooting everywhere.

<br />Crappy missions in liberty? What are you talking about, it's called building up your character. Besides, if you knew something about that, you'd know taking missions isn't really the most profitable route in early character build up.
<br />

<br />That's exactly what I do every time I make you wait for me at a docking ring, foaming at the mouth and all. Actually I take a few deep breaths of nice fresh air, just to make you wait longer.
<br />
<br />Speaking about foaming at the mouth, are you also twitching like a mad man when posting here? I don't know but it's as if EVERY post in this thread made by you, gets edited and corrected. 
<br />
<br />May I suggest a nice cool beer to calm down those nerves? <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle></div>

			<div class="content">Wow Han. You can write narrative stories! How wonderful, im delighted.
<br />
<br />Unfortunetly your story is rather... melodramatic. I love the part you omitted about you coming &quot;headstrong&quot; at me and being &quot;utterly decimated&quot;. Rather sad.
<br />
<br />I wonder Han, if Liberty happened to be the location for your cardamine run, why did you goto California? It sells much better in New York. Oh, and not to mention, why do Cardamine runs? It isnt the best run in the game, its not that great at all, actually. 
<br />
<br />Like your friends, you can talk big, but play small. To &quot;win&quot; this &quot;war&quot; you have to bring in, as our list shows, almost 15 players, to fight.. Neo's 3. Then you act full of swagger when we get allies, seeing as the odds are quite unfair (the #1 thing you whine about). 
<br />
<br />OWL is good at roleplaying and acting like Freelancer is some storybook, but in their case, it is merely a childs storybook where the &quot;good-guy&quot; always wins. How sad that this is not always the case in real life. 
<br />
<br />You can brag, talk big, act like god, be the truth-upholding-righteous people you *act* to be, and I may say you do play the role well, but you pick on people in patriots. Even if a NEO, this is a cowardly pussy-assed pathetic move. Oh, and by the way, Rippers suck. Outside Freeport 9 not one of your Rippers hit me. 
<br />
<br />Your valiant efforts to act like the good-guys, I fear, are in all but vain. Lets say the past is the best predictor of future events, youve tolled, taken, kept people from getting ships and more. You act like kings of the Seattle server, and you will do the same here.
<br />
<br />Act like you know what youre saying, play the part, but actors aren't as real as the *true* heros. You fail to become them in any way. Even Superheros in cartoons do not pick on pick on weak enemies in some irate manner. I love how you whine like a scared, lost child in game, but on the forums you are gods gift to the world.
<br />
<br />Please, I would love to hear more of your stories, perhaps compiling them into a book would be acceptable? The Brothers OWL. It would be a smashing hit with the children, as this is exactly the story they create, play, and forget.
<br />
<br />Like the stories, they will be forgotten, drowned in the real world, where real things happen, not in your imagination, exactly where OWL's &quot;victories&quot; come from. 
<br />
<br />You claim that running like a scared little insect is &quot;victory&quot;? Running from battle sir, is surrendering. Your &quot;victories&quot; are nothing, not even reminiscent of a victory. Perhaps you lived to see another day, but in Freelancer, unlike the real world, you can respawn. 
<br />
<br />Perhaps we should also take into account your yet again, blind-sided stories, leaving out the losses and failures, to appease the story lovers among us. Perhaps your story would mean something, if there was even a slight amount of truth in it. This isn't even fact-based fiction. This is pure, whole, complete fiction. You lie, you cheat, and you pretend to win.
<br />
<br />OWL is simply braggarts that have an ego that is directly proportional to the amount of **** they speak, piss they spew, and lies they tell. 
<br />
<br />Your &quot;stories&quot; would be a little more... acceptable had you not pretended that this is the 3rd Episode of Star Wars, and maybe something more.. down to earth. Speaking of coming down to earth, your Budweiser gets you really high doesnt it?</div>
