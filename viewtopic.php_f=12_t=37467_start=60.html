			<div class="content">Regardless of who is right or wrong in all of this, and it goes beyond just this one thread, everyone needs to take a step back and take a breath for a minute. I have read things from both sides of this whole issue that just weren't right. Neither side is without some measure of guilt to one degree or another. The fact remains though, there are still well over a thousand people that still come to this site for Freelancer news, mods and so forth. Many of these people have splintered off into subcommunities of there own, whether that be a server community, or a mod community, but they all hold one common bond, and that is this website. They may not visit the forums as much as others, I am one of these people, but there are a great many people that you don't see on the forums that are just as much a part of the Freelancer community as anyone else, and without this website, the Freelancer community would surely die. 
<br />
<br />I am not taking any side in this whole issue here, I just want everyone to think about this before they continue blasting away at people from the other side. It may just appear that the Moderators and Off Topic community are at odds here, but the entire Freelancer community, that still does play the game, is caught in the middle.
<br />
<br />Whenever I come across a forum adminstration that I can't get along with, I just move along until I find one that I can. I personally haven't had an issue with the admins and moderators here, but I don't post here much either, so I am sure some people have legitimate complaints. Regardless though, the admins and moderators do run this website, so it is their decision to manage it how they see fit. You can say that they run it badly, disagree with the site's direction, or whatever, but it is still their site to run. I manage a forum for a major mod studio, and I know there are people that don't like me either. It comes with the territory. In the end though, either you are going to get along with the moderators or you're not. If you're not than please go on somewhere and don't try to wreck the site for the ones that do enjoy it. 
<br />
<br />If you don't like the site anymore, than don't contribute to it, it is that simple. Just say goodbye, let your friends know where you'll be, and go in peace. That way the people that still come here for Freelancer will still have a site to come to.</div>

			<div class="content">Alright, enough about this. As Admin of this place together with bp, I have the responsibility of this site and for its staff. Therefore I take full responsibility for the deletion of the thread and so by all means blame me and you can all email me if you feel the need to do so. I just won't let this 'search for the culprit' endure any longer, I am responsible for the team and the site, so I will take the blame, it's as easy as that. You can be assured we discuss these things off screen.
<br />
<br />Now, I'm very willing to hear constructive feedback, so if you want please be my guest to create a new thread or something and maybe we can have a civil and constructive conversation and I promise it won't be deleted, you have my word on that. But please give up the search for 'the culprit', blame me for that. Again, we surely want to resolve our differences if possible.
