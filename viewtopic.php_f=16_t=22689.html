			<h3 class="first"><a href="#p15754" class="post-subject">Startracker Campaign</a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">And now the final entry in the trilogy.  I've beaten the campaign with the three weakest ships in the game.  Every other ship has equal or greater firepower and maneuverability than one of these ships (except the Humpback), so we now know the campaign is beatable with every ship in the game.
<br />
<br />As for the Startracker, here we go.
<br />
<br />My initial observation that the Startracker has less firepower than the Rhino turned out to be incorrect.  The Rhino can deliver damage fast from seven hardpoints, but the power runs out after three seconds of that.  The 'Tracker has a surprisingly beefy powerplant for a ship of that low level; it can sustain 3x Adv. Scorpion fire for a good thirty seconds before running dry.
<br />
<br />Regarding maneuverability, the Startracker lives up to its name quite well.  Its sustained turn rate may be down there with the Defender and Anubis, but its acceleration is right up there with the Starflier and Patriot.  It takes a while to get on an enemy's six, but once there the 'Tracker can stay there very well and can fire nonstop the whole time.
<br />
<br />Since the Startracker isn't available until after mission 2, I just took my save from the Maximum Fun campaign where my Defender had four Adv. Scorpions before mission 3, and bought a Startracker to mount them on.
<br />
<br />There's only one good combination of weapons for this ship.  It doesn't have the hardpoints to spare to mess around with shieldbusters or missiles; it needs three guns.  And nothing compares to the Adv. Scorpion to fill the class-3 slots, but the only good class-4 companion to them (matching projectile speed) is the Outcast Dragoon gun.  I didn't go out of my way to get the Dragoon, but just used three Adv. Scorpions until getting to Cali Base normally where I bought one Dragoon.
<br />
<br />For mission 4, I bought and equipped a Sweeper class-4 EMP missile launcher to play around with, but it really isn't all that effective because once you shoot a missile at an enemy fighter, your guns will bring down the shield anyway before the missile gets there.  It makes a nice zappy effect, but it's pretty useless.
<br />
<br />The Startracker cruised through the first eight missions quite easily; I had to run away to recharge maybe once in the Rheinland battle at Willard, once in the Tau-29 fleet battle, and two or three times at the Transport.  The 'Tracker's beefy powerplant and small size let it take down the Tekagi weapons platforms easily.  Based on my results with the Startracker, I think that the Starflier's ability to take little damage is probably more due to its small size than its maneuverability.  The Startracker does not share the 'Flier's maneuverability, but it shares its small size, and did share its ability to avoid damage most of the time.
<br />
<br />Tekagi's arch delivered me my first death; three in total in all.  One against the Tekagi patrol (these ships are noticeably more deadly than anything in the campaign before them), and twice in the exact same way at the Arch.  Both times at the Arch I successfully took out all four shield generators with heavy use of Drillers, but the system/graphics lag generated when the shield goes down make me take several quick missile hits before I could respond.  The third time I made it, and with 13 nanobots and 11 batteries to spare.
<br />
<br />Mission 10 was easy, with Drillers to register three cruiser kills in the fleet battle and to kill the experimental battleship.
<br />
<br />Mission 11 was the hardest, as it is for anything that isn't a freighter.  On this mission, I realized that the Startracker is very effective at applying mines to stationary targets.  Its small size means that the mine launcher is effectively closer to the target than it is with a bigger ship like the Rhino, and a closer mine is of course a more effective mine.  At the beginning of mission 11, I flew right into the middle of the Navy satellite and took it out with mines right away. (Screenshot is below.)  The rest of mission 11 was flying around as usual, picking off fighters at the edges of the fights when possible.  Oh, and three rather embarrassing deaths in the battle before the jump gate when I pulled a thruster-kill getaway, and backed up right into the minefield.  Yes, I did that three separate times.
<br />
<br />Mission 12 was easy as usual again (do the Nomad fighters intentionally not shoot you during this mission?)  The battle on the other side of the jump hole was somewhat hard, but this time (unlike the Starflier and Rhino) I got through it on the first try.  As I wrote in the Rhino campaign, the big problem here is the gunboats.  The Startracker (and thus any class-4 or better ship) has enough firepower and protection to fly in to a gunboat, keep its guns trained on the target the whole time, and blast it to death usually before the other Nomad fighters take down the 'Tracker's shields.  Being able to take out the gunboats made this fight MUCH easier than in the class-3 ships.
<br />
<br />Mission 13 - cake.  Small size is the biggest advantage you can have against the shield generators, which the Startracker has in spades.  A load full of Driller mines, and the Nomads were history yet again.
<br />
<br />Screenshots coming in next post.
<br />
<br />And now on to the FLDQ runs...

			<div class="content">I do not remember screen shots or stories like T-Hawk's enjoyable series of topics but I think the Defender was mentioned. NukeIt has grabbed the Mule but the race is open for the Bloodhound, I guess. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />The Defender should be the most enjoyable of these since it has the most hardpoints (including a forward-firing turret), can use torpedos and is very manoeuvrable for a HF. The Bloodhound should be very similar to the Startracker, just slightly more manoeuvrable and slightly more armour.
<br />
<br />P.S.: I just noticed the the turret of the Bloodhound <b>fires forward </b>. This means it is more like my favourite ship the Dagger (just one class 3 hardpoint less) than like the Startracker. That changes everything ... Guess what my next project is going to be. <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />I like a more laid back game of FL myself, but hats off. Right now I'm just trying to see how much of Sirius I can map out in a Hawk before I get dusted by the Hessians or Outcasts. Only the Omega and Edge systems left <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br />The &quot;Nomad Laser&quot; (not Nomad Energy Cannons or Energy Blasters) have a refire rate of 1.00, which is why they do not shoot you that often in the misson.

			<div class="content">i do the campaign now for the 3th time
<br />
<br />1st was in hf,
<br />2nd in lf, only after toledo i toke the anubis for after the campaign...
<br />3th i will go for defender and take that to the end (i will c how far i can come in it...)
<br />
<br />in hf is it more divicullier then in lf, what i know... so i will c how the defender act in the end of the campaign...
<br />
<br />ps. after the 1st and 2nd was a long gap... after the 2nd and 3th a small, just ended that a week ago... (5 hours work...)
<br />
<br />- edit1: i'm now lev 2 and buyed the defender with some weaps...
<br />
<br />- edit2
<br />I'm now enemy of whole liberty, must launch from manhattan. i have the weaps:
<br />- drail (class 3, rogeus)
<br />- drail
<br />- drail
<br />- vengeance mk I (class 4, liberty)
<br />- vengeance mk I
<br />- rowlett's revenge (class 3, special)
<br />
<br />- more later -
<br />
<br />- edit3
<br />the escape from liberty to mactan base was easy, had to use 2 times shield batts, and 1 time a nano, but beamed the same in... i'm now heading to Leeds
<br />
<br />- edit 4
<br />i'm now on the Baxter Research station, the escape from sprague was easy, but had to use a few batts and nano's, but it's ok. now on my way back to leeds... that was easy... rheinland &quot;friends&quot; where almost death when all hostiles where destroyed... on to mission 6...
<br />weap outload:
<br />- Barrager mk I (class 2, junkers)
<br />- Barrager mk I
<br />- Barrager mk I
<br />- Skyrail (class 4, bretonia)
<br />- Skyrail
<br />- Hellfurry turret mk I (class 4, hackers)
<br />
<br />the skyrail gonna be pyros type 1 (class 4, outcast) and the turret a pyros type 1 turret (class 4, outcast)
<br />
<br />- edit 5
<br />i change 1 of the barrager now in a slingshot missile launcher, to get longer power for the other weaps. buyed also the starkiller torp.
<br />
<br />- edit 6
<br />i saved quintaine and i'm back on leeds (again), died 1 time (was just to late with batts and nano repair <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)... now the escape from bretonia... i will tell later
<br />
<br />- edit 7
<br />died 2 times by the battleship and cruisers in tau-29... but the 3th did it fine, and killed a lot (didn't need to get in cruise speed at all)... had only 3 nano and 2 batts left... going to kusari is easy (no enemy's who r waiting nearby)... and the defender is a good hf, till now... i hope it will do the job in later missions as well as i hope they will...)
<br />
<br />- edit 8
<br />mission 8 (tagachi transport) was easy (died 2 times, 2 missiles and almost no shield... and 2 times mission fail by attack neutral opbject (lastest weap platform what i destroyed, but a torp of mine was still on his way)...
<br />
<br />mission 9, i will begin now on it... this will test the defender good, if i'm right...
<br />it was easy to get in the arch, i used all batts, and had 12 bots over, to get out was a divicult task... but did that also... what's next... ow, yeah heading to berlin...
<br />
<br />- edit 9
<br />berlin and frankfurt was easy, had to use nano 1 time before jumping to hamburg, radiation eated almost the whole hull away <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>, no shield down, taking out the satalite was divicult... have only 5 nano left <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>... up to save the president in alaska... hope the backway is easier (i know it's not... but i hope, otherwhise i fly in cruise speed the whole time till i'm on the osiris again)...
<br />
<br />- edit 10
<br />the way out was easy to stay in cruisespeed and seek hide in the shipyard (flying from 1 side to the other of thus 2 shipyards) entering osiris again wasn't easy, co'z ur speed is 0 wen playing again (died 1 time by that)... but it's fine... now the powercell...
<br />it's fine they give me 10k for repaires and buy stuff (have 4.7k right now), had before the mission not mutch...
<br />the powercell was easy after dieing 1 time... i needed an other tactic then i mostly do in their... fly toward it aand shoot missiles and use mines also (normal i do hiding inside the lair and shoot with weaps...
<br />toledo was also a good to do, 1 time die, but after that 14 nano and 14 batts landed on toledo again and landed with 14 batts and 14 nanos on osiris, next the atack of ther homeworld... what will that be in the defender... 
<br />
<br />- edit 11
<br />the attack on their homeworld was easy (die 0 tymes), and had 12 nanobots and 2 shieldbatts left... killed some nomad interceptors to get some batts and nano's... but it was easy going...
