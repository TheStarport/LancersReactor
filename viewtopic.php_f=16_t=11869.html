			<div class="content">Yes been said before, but I REALLY need to get this out.
<br />
<br />1. Game has clearly not been testet properly:
<br />Economy - way way way easier trading than leveling through missions.
<br />
<br />Unlabled Objects - jumpholes, suns
<br />
<br />AI - all hostiles targets you(other players) above ALL OTHER targets
<br />
<br />2. Lacking
<br />Missions - BORING... after 100 missions you are ready to jettison what ever you had for lunch... 
<br />
<br />Mission - Blowing up bases, battleships, guarding transports and so on... dynamic missions
<br />(and as someone wrote somewhere, random missions like a battleship with a blown engine some where i a distant system... you get paid to deliver engine parts AND keeps the profits also)
<br />
<br />Ships - Better variety, difference in speed for exsample, instead of just having 3 top ones that everyone use.
<br />(think anubis is one of the coolest looking ships.. soo there!)
<br />
<br />Equipment - The difference between shields should be more powerful,
<br />and thrusters could use some differences too (along with a class and type...LF, HF).
<br />Missiles are not really worth the cash, when you get some nomad weapons, missiles are worthless (sunslayer is nice though)
<br />
<br />JumpHOLES - I understand how jumpGATES can deny you access, as it is a mechanical structer.... but jumpHOLES are anomolies, how can you be denied access? blah!
<br />
<br />Dialog - &quot;you knew here?&quot; grrr no comment
<br />
<br />Systems - Those &quot;easter egg&quot; systems seems unfinished....
<br />I havnt figured out the robot world yet, but primus has the planet junai as a description and is called a Samura base (tried gettting that rep to the top... still no missions... cant get anymore friendly that I already am)
<br />(and why are there no nomad battleships in them ??? =(
<br />(btw, try flying to the corner sun in system with the two planets.... when you reach the corner there is still like 100-120 clicks to the sun, meaning you can work &quot;outside the box&quot; when you mod ^^ ... really didnt wanna fly all the way back, so flew into the sun... oh btw waypoints and target distance mess up out there)
<br />
<br />
<br />Objects - Better gravity for the different stuff in space, suns, planets, jumpholes
<br />stuff like a blackhole somewhere wouldve been nice.
<br />
<br />
<br />Nav - as there is a command for target so should there be for Nav's.... so you could skip navs, istead of trying to change in midt battle.
<br />
<br />Editor - .... lets face it, Freelancer is a nice game, but it lacks replay value, modding is the only thing that is gonna keep it alive IMHO.
<br />
<br />I was overwelmed during the SP, and in the begining of multi (went straight to multi after sp).. I mean this game REALLY has potential, but unless there comes some patch/editor/fansite made stuff, I think most would agree that it could have been SOOOO much more.
<br />
<br />Thumbs up to all you modders that are trying to help make the game better, you rock!</div>

			<div class="content">MY gripes...
<br />
<br />The sound.... i had to go to extreme lengths to get my sound to work properly with a SB Live! 5.1 and win XP-lol MS atleast after 1/2 of the SP mission i finally could hear ppl say &quot;hey check your fire ****&quot; when i hit wrong ships. oh and get critcal data i needed from Juni/King. no excuse for bad software support!
<br />
<br />Ships not portable between servers.  I can understand this due to different levels, but like many said, it sux to have to rebuild all your stuff all over again. some of u kids don't have anything better to do and can, others like me who has a job and family can't  move as fast.
<br />
<br />Optional available voice com. (with muteing of course for the 10 yr olds)-lol
<br />
<br />Better/ or some  hack/trainer detection/blocking... well, good luck wit that!
<br />
<br />the option to change hud, say make it smaller, and remove that DAM thing at the top that u click  i can;t tell u how much damage i took trying to shoot at an enemy at top of screen only to go into lane dockign mode. ( i have looked all over to find how to remove it.) if anyone know plz lemme know! i just use the F keys.
<br />
<br />O I agree ships should have diff speeds  lighter one s faster, heavier slower.
<br />
<br />and can we please find a way to kill the dam docking cutscenes? i mean u seen one u seen them all!
<br />
<br />I think that there should have been more than 4 ppl do voice overs, i mean u have one guy fighting another guy and they have the same voice!- ROFL! ok so it is his  evil twin corsair brother?&gt;!!
<br />
<br />as quoted:

<br />Missiles are not really worth the cash, when you get some nomad weapons, missiles are worthless (sunslayer is nice though)
<br />
<br />Missles are to slow! i mean i could have already fumped out of the cockpit and beat the hell outta the pilot b4 one will launch an hit.... humm must be based on an anime fight scene? oph wait that was the torpedo!

<br />Mission - Blowing up bases, battleships, guarding transports and so on... dynamic missions
<br />(and as someone wrote somewhere, random missions like a battleship with a blown engine some where i a distant system... you get paid to deliver engine parts AND keeps the profits also)
<br />
<br />well, i can think of more later but now that's all.
<br />
<br />all in all i like the game, the SP part was a rollercoaster ride for me of pure shock and awe.  I love the graphics and effects, how dif systems had their own touches, like rielanders had a lot of green in the enery weapons, and engines for example 
<br />i really did hate to see it end actually.
<br />
<br /> SP EXPANSION PLZ hint hint!</div>

			<div class="content">I work as a admin in a gaming community called Boomtown in Denmark....
<br />we (us admins) have been pressing the top, about getting servers, and they have considered it....
<br />but they have to take much into account, and with the way corrupted gamefiles crashes the whole server, and is unable to start unless the file is MANUALLY removed, isnt something that speaks well for the suggestion, without even taking anything else into account (such as price, server mantainance, customer base, login issues, admin tools and so on)</div>
