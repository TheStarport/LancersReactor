			<div class="content">Hello, I was wondering if people can help me out with a few problems im having with Freelancer. It's not really the game itself, it's in certain areas. My goal is to get every gun, turret, shield (if possible), &amp; thurster in the game in my inventory (not mounted obsuvally). I know I can't get every shield cause they won't let me buy freighter or light fighter shields for my Titan. What sucks is that I found out that certain guns, turrets, shields &amp; thrusters can't be bought outside the single player game. For example, the Rowlett's revenge turret, and the order weapons and shields and thruster. 
<br />My questions are: (also I do not want to mod anything... i want to accomplsh this without the use of any mods) this is all in single player.
<br />
<br />1) Where can I obtain the &quot;Adv Champion Heavy Fighter&quot; level 10 graviton shield? (I heard it can be dropped by ships in the Omicron Alpha system but I tried to no avail, not sure if u have to be at a certain level, i was at 34)
<br />2) How many rowlett's revenge turrets are dropped at the start of mission 3?
<br />3) The Nomad ships in the unknown system drop Nomad blasters and cannons, but do they drop their thrusters? (if u scan them u see they use a diff. thruster)
<br />4) How do you obtain battleship kills?
<br />5) How many guns/turrets do you get from each wreck? (class 10)
<br />6) What equipment items are only available during the storyline portion of the game?
<br />7) I have the official Freelancer guidebook.. it has a list of all the items, but not where I can get them.. I am aware of Freelancer Datastorm. But is there a list of equipment (guns, etc.) that cannot be bought, only dropped from ships?
<br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> any other information that you feel that would help me... like things that cant be gotten if ur not in the story, things that you can't get unless you do something... any easter eggs, etc. 
<br />Thank you in advance for anyone that responds. My e-mail: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:Jameskirk48@hotmail.com">Jameskirk48@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->

			<div class="content">Okay, here are the answers I know ....
<br />

<br />
<br />I personally don't *think* you can get that shield, I'll let someone else answer that. There is a sticky with all the weapon/shield stats in the spoiler forun though.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>2) How many rowlett's revenge turrets are dropped at the start of mission 3?  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />From my past experiences, 1. It's not very good though and there was a recent thread saying how crappy it is. I'll let you find that though.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>3) The Nomad ships in the unknown system drop Nomad blasters and cannons, but do they drop their thrusters? (if u scan them u see they use a diff. thruster)  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />No, they don't drop thrusters, only weapons. They use no energy though.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>4) How do you obtain battleship kills?  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Destroy some battleships in the storyline. the only thing is, is that *you* have to fire the finishing-off shot to get it. That's quite hard to do though.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>5) How many guns/turrets do you get from each wreck? (class 10)  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Again, I'll let someone answer that, I don't know.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>6) What equipment items are only available during the storyline portion of the game?  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />None, except Rowletts Revenge (I think)
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>7) I have the official Freelancer guidebook.. it has a list of all the items, but not where I can get them.. I am aware of Freelancer Datastorm. But is there a list of equipment (guns, etc.) that cannot be bought, only dropped from ships? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Again, read weapon/shield stats stickys in the spoilers forum.
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade> any other information that you feel that would help me... like things that cant be gotten if ur not in the story, things that you can't get unless you do something... any easter eggs, etc.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Dunno what the question is.
<br />
<br />To anyone who asks me why I'm answering newbie questions, It's because he asked nicely and I will answer accordingly.

<br />
<br />Champion Shields aren't in the game. Can't be bought anywhere. Oversight from Microsoft and Digital Anvil 
<br />
<br />2) How many rowlett's revenge turrets are dropped at the start of mission 3?
<br /> Only 1 
<br />
<br />3) The Nomad ships in the unknown system drop Nomad blasters and cannons, but do they drop their thrusters? (if u scan them u see they use a diff. thruster)
<br /> They only drop weapons, nothing else 
<br />
<br />4) How do you obtain battleship kills?
<br />Like the previous poster said, you have to fire the killing shot. You can only kill battleships in the story missions, not after it anymore 
<br />
<br />5) How many guns/turrets do you get from each wreck? (class 10)
<br />They drop in pairs; eg, 2 Diamondbacks or 2 Cereberus 
<br />
<br />6) What equipment items are only available during the storyline portion of the game?
<br />Only the ones your level allows. you can't by lvl 20 weapons when you're still lvl 16  
<br />
<br />7) I have the official Freelancer guidebook.. it has a list of all the items, but not where I can get them.. I am aware of Freelancer Datastorm. But is there a list of equipment (guns, etc.) that cannot be bought, only dropped from ships?

			<div class="content">To Neo_Kuja and /-Entropy-/. Thank you very much for your help. It is just kind of annoying that the game was rushed for delivery (I guess) and that certain elements that are in its &quot;official guidebook&quot; are not even included in the game. It would be very cool if they came out with a second patch that fixed (or added) all the items that were rushed and left out. Whatever the case thank you again for your help. If anyone has any more information for this topic or post please feel free to email me or to post it in here. Thank you again.

<br />
<br />In some mods these shields do indeed 'drop' but in the original game they do not drop and you would not want them anyway because NPC shields have virtually no regeneration and there are no HF/Fr variants (all shields have the light fighter type capacity). What the mods do is 'drop' real shields as phantom/bonus loot and/or put real shields on NPC ships, instead of NPC shields.
<br />
<br />The line of available graviton shields ends at class 7, except for the HF (heavy fighter) variant which you can get as class 8 inside the reinforced shopping cart known as Titan. IOW, there are no class 8 LF/Fr gravitons, and no class 9/10 gravitons of any type. The line of available moleculars ends at class 9, and only positrons go all the way to class 10 (the much-favoured Adv. Brigandine).
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>2) How many rowlett's revenge turrets are dropped at the start of mission 3? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>

<br />As the others have noted, it is only one (alas). It is dropped as phantom loot if you kill the leader of the pack. Contrary to what others have said, it is a very fine turret and easily the best class 3 one that can be gotten. Perfect for outfitting a Rhino, if only there were more than one ...

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>4) How do you obtain battleship kills? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />By killing cruisers and destroyers - or battleships that are actually <b>ships </b> and not <b>solars </b>. See the thread <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=22795&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Battleship+kills+that+do+get+counted&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;M=False&amp;S=True' Target=_Blank>Battleship kills that do get counted</a> for a discussion of this problem. My personal record is 17 registered BS kills during one single-player campaign run, but it should be possible to get at least 20. A couple of relevant threads are linked from my overview/linky topic <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=23634&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Life+after+level+38+%2D+campaign+fun+overview&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;cat_title=Freelancer&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank>Life after level 38 - campaign fun overview</a>.
<br />Look for FLDQ-related threads; the relevant discipline is 'Tmax runs' .

<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>7) ... is there a list of equipment (guns, etc.) that cannot be bought, only dropped from ships? <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />Rowlett's Revenge and class 10 kit (CODENAMEs, Nomads) have been mentioned already. But there is also the mighty Ripper Mine Launcher, which can only be looted from a ship graveyard but not bought (except in MP, from other players).
<br />
<br /><font size=1 face="trebuchet ms"><BLOCKQUOTE><hr size=1 noshade>8) any other information that you feel that would help me... like things that cant be gotten if ur not in the story, things that you can't get unless you do something... any easter eggs, etc.  <hr size=1 noshade></BLOCKQUOTE></font>
<br />
<br />The only bona fide easter eggs in the game are Rowlett's Revenge and the robot/monkey planets. However, if you know where the wrecks with lootable high-class equipment are then you can make your ship much stronger than the game designers intended. 
<br />
<br />For example, you can loot a Ripper mine launcher and 20 Ripper mines has soon as you have a boat that can stand the heat up there in Omicron Alpha (Drake or Barracuda with class 5 shield or better recommended). This is some seriously heavy ordnance which allows some serious fun to be had during the campaign. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Another example, the Balboa wreck in California yields a pair of class 5 particle guns and a wreck in Texas yields a pair of class 5 Catapult missile launchers and 20 missiles (you can get more missiles if you kill Unioner Falcons, which is easy if you have a ship like the Dagger); Outcast Daggers will drop class 4 particle guns if you ask nicely and are not too poor. This means you can max out a Cavalier or Crusader with the finest weapons that it can carry, long before you are even allowed to <b>buy </b> class 5 stuff. See the thread <a href='http://www.lancersreactor.com/t/forum/topic.asp?topic_id=20107&amp;forum_id=16&amp;Topic_Title=Plan+for+a+maximum%2Dfun+campaign+%3Cimg+src%3Dsmilies%2Ficon%5Fsmile%2Egif+width%3D15+height%3D15+border%3D0+align%3Dmiddle%&amp;forum_title=Freelancer+Spoiler+Forum&amp;cat_title=Freelancer&amp;M=False' Target=_Blank>Plan for a Maximum-Fun Campaign</a> for some ideas how to utilize the excess firepower. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Also, during campaign missions you can loot hostile depots with impunity - sometimes even twice during one and the same mission - because during missions your reputation sheet is essentially 'frozen'. The FLDQ threads contain a discussion of this effect, which was discovered by T-Hawk.</div>
