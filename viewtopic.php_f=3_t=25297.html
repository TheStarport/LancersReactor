			<div class="content">You know I was thinking of how fun Freelancer is, along with its interactive easy setup. Well I wonder what a game like Freelancer would look like in the world of EVE without the long time spending the game just for skills and the fun first person shooter action.
<br />
<br />In fact, how many of you haave tryed the online-game EVE? Well if you haven't give it a go, if you don't like it, Wal-Mart will allways take it back. Sorry Germans I don't think you'll have a local Wal-Mart around. But, it's just an idea.
<br />
<br />My regards to all of you hard working mod makers. By the way I have a awsome ship design in Milkshape. If you care to take a look at it I will send it. I really would like to have it completed. Thanks!</div>

			<div class="content">I have Eve - and after installing it, and downloading via my 56k modem a 28 meg patch, followed by a 5 meg patch, followed by a server crash, followed by routine maintance, followed by more random crashes i finally gave up when i was presented with another patch to download to fix those crashes.
<br />
<br />It also was to laborious to start out with - they need to lower some of those skill requirements - but then again - they want it too take a long time so they can milk you for all the money online as possible.
<br />
<br />I took it back, and was told that the 10 day returns rule doesn't apply - even though it doesn't say that anywhere. In four days i just had problem after problem with that game. Lots of downloading time, server problems with the one i choose - basically it sucked, especially since i have to pay for it all as well.
<br />
<br />It was a very pretty game though, but i feel that online only looses alot of stuff. Mind you - makes it easy for them to make games if they don't bother with a storyline or anything else.</div>

			<div class="content">EVE is a pretty good game(gotta love those attack drones <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ) but it is extremly boring.  If you could fly your own ship by hand abd control its aiming then it would be more fun but as it stands all you do is click an enemy ship, say attack and that is pretty well all there is.  If they combined FL with EVE, done correctly it would be a seriously kick azz game.

			<div class="content">Well, yes it is a multiplayer substription game, but my point is. I would love to see Freelancer with a world more grand and larger, with skills you learn, but not to take up a life time geting just one skill down. I like the fact that you can make about the same cash from mining and trading. The drones are a great idea. Eve just has that problem with being lonely in space and taaking forever. It has no action, and is very complicated, unike Freelancer. I do however love that you can have multiple ships and move them around with other ships, PLUS you can have those huge ships that are more like sapce stations but move and are made to fight (Titans as they are called).</div>

			<div class="content">i wouldn't - Freelancer would be way to dull if it was like that with learning skills, and also there would be no story. Good thing is doing the story over again when bored. Also - FL is pretty much fast action - and if you fly through space you see other things you can go wail on. Eve has lots of empty space to fly through - which is very dull. Although its universe is larger, FL could easily do that too - you could make another 50 systems easily - its just that EVE systems are so empty as to be boring, and the tasks you do repetative. We could do that - but whats the point?
<br />
<br />This should be in the off topic forum, and its title really doesn't reflect what its about. It should be a 'Would you be playing FL if it was like this?'.
<br />
<br />My answer is that i would have fallen asleep the first time i played it. I am also firmly against pay subscriptions at &#163;12 a month to play games - it is extortion by game companies, and i think it will eventually kill online gaming in communities after a certain time span. 
<br />
<br />Lets face it, if we had to pay to play FL, i would have stopped playing about 4 months ago when it ran out of new challenges for me. What would be the point in paying for a game that i don't find new challenges. Sure i enjoy flying round in different ships, but i wouldn't PAY for that part of entertainment, certainly not an extra &#163;60 for it (about 90 dollars) - heck, i could have had three new games for that money. 
<br />I don't play much anymore either - i mainly mod like a monkey!

			<div class="content">@chips I couldn't agree with you more.  If FL was subscription based, it doesn't matter how much i love the game, i doubt very much that I would have paid for it.
<br />
<br />as far as the universe being larger is concerned, it could be done with FL, but the missions would have to vary quite seriously.  I know that I always harp on about elite (*yawn* yeah yeah I know), but the beauty of that game was that you could go into a system with absolutely nothing in it and not be bored because of the mission you are on - for example, if you were tailing someone for assassination or simply for loot.   
<br />
<br />Chips tell me something...being the mod extraordinaire that you appear to be...is it at all possible to mod FL to have a better, more interesting type of mission? Or is it a case that we have to cross our fingers and hope DA will release an FL2/expansion pack?  The reason I ask is because your upcoming latest mod appears to have much more in it than I originally thought possible from mods....?
<br />
<br />oh...and yes...this should really be in the off topic forum.</div>

			<div class="content">Ohh - i aint no modder extrodinaire - i just learn quick, and explore ways, and have a good idea base (about 120 people in the TE). They shot out ideas, i played with them, made them work, plonked them in. There is nothing new to modding in here, just new ideas. I am also a teacher, and although its not quite the same, they always say that the fastest way to learn is to teach it. I answer and help as many poeple as i can in Accushots and my help thread in the modding forum. In fact, alot of recent mods contain content from the newer thread i made - so its really nice to see people gaining experience, putting it to use and working well! 
<br />
<br />  The reason it sounds good is just the attention to detail and the 120 people who gave me about 1500 posts in total on the mod (what to put in etc). If i could start again, i would. It would be done 15 times faster (I wouldn't now need to learn how to systems mod, i can do it.......lol)and a hell of alot neater too. Some ideas are discarded due to the fact that it is so built into the mod aready, to extract and change it would take days.........which is kinda sad on some points.
<br /> 
<br />However - Subxero and i am hoping to colaborate on a mod after i finish this, and one direction i really want to move in is the missions - but storyline ones. As far as i can see there is no way to change the random ones, but  the storyline ones don't look to impossible - its just working out how to make it do things. I think i can already give you another objective, and so on, but i haven't tested this out yet (must complete first mod! LOL)

			<div class="content">Now I never said anything that I wanted FL to be like EVE. I only said that EVE has some real life facts and important features that Freelancer lacks. But never should you have to pay so much a month for a game. Now $5.00 sounds a whole lot more reasonable.
<br />
<br />Besides, my title is not to catch the eyes of critics, it is simply to tell that I had a dream about this weird idea.
<br />
<br />EVE is quite boring as many have said, which is why I said I love how much action there is in FL. Tell me, would you like to have more then one ship, would you like to see a larger universe, perhaps a huge variety in ship classes and sizes, and more mining. I beleive drones for mining and fighting are great. I love the fact that there is room for people to create and hold up their own factions.
<br />
<br />Now, I know everyone hates the idea of the skills. Perhaps you never thought in stead of wasting time for them to lvl and earn them, that you would only have to buy skills. You allready buy ships, trade goods, excessories, and better ratings with factions... Well why not skills for differnt classes of ships or trade skills, maybe piracy requires a special school, but only pay money for the skill. My point is simple Freelancer is a great game, but seems to lack certain facts of life and more intertainment for the players. I would also like to include that I hate jump lanes and like hyper drive a whole lot better.</div>

			<div class="content">True  - it could easily have some extra features for you to work for, which would increase the game length for a while. Only increase though, it would just prolong the inevitable. Personally i would prefer it if there were random storyline missions instead. by this i mean that as you fly round at the end, you find someone in one system, who needs help - liek a character from earlier. If you accept the mission (its presented like a normal random mission so that you never know for sure what you are getting), then it cuts to video scences and starts a new storyline thread for a couple of missions or something......like you are helping someone out in the 'cause'. Now make this happen at lots of bases and for lots of factions, and these popping up in correlation to what level u are so that you don't get loads and loads at once, but they appear as your level increases at various bases, and you really have a freelancer. 
<br />
<br /> Put that in wiht new random missions (protect freighter, escorts) and i think that the game could be thousands of times better. It would give you massive incentives to explore and so on, like you could stumble across a ship being attacked in a system, and if you help out and they survive - it kicks off into a mini storyline again - lots of variation, lots of exploration and one heck of alot better game!!
<br />Now THAT would be good.
<br />If only i knew how to do that it would be REALLY good...............lol
