<br />as he took his first bite of decent food (the rations tasted bad) he saw him and waved him over &quot;where are we, what happned?&quot; he asked &quot;heres your card back.&quot; he said and passed it over it now said blood dragons on it, they ofen busted like that in escape pods &quot;your  on freeport 4, i picked up your escape pod out there so before you go killing me, it be best i leave before you find out who i really am. im sorry about borrowing your card but im twice as broke as you and i think it would be best you stay here, get a side job and a ship, if you want a ship like mine theres somebody on manhatten who will renovate it for you, and bartender, could you put this in a takeout package, i changed my mind&quot;</div>

<br />&quot;thanks, and i will maybe go to manhattan, as you suggested...&quot;
<br />after that he lefted... i walked to the bartender and asked him if their is a transporter with goes to manhattan. co'z i want to see how it looks over their. and thought that their is maybe an other way back to my home...
<br />after that their was my next thought; &quot;damned, i'm still stuck around here...&quot;
<br />
<br />the bartender said to me that their is a spa &amp; cruise shipment in need off some new pilots, maybe they are for what you look, they fly to planet manhattan also. i asked him some info about it, but he said that he will arange a meating as soon as possible...
<br />
<br />an hour later he the bartender came to me, alone... and said that i must go now to the ship launch pads and ask for someone with the name Helliot...
<br />
<br />i did that and a female came to me and said that i was boarded in the transporter itself with 3 others, she is the one with fly the transporter itself. the route is unknown, next stop is manhattan. i will get 500 credits for this.
<br />
<br />she launched inmediate and enters the tradeline to california.</div>

<br />&quot;thanks, and i will maybe go to manhattan, as you suggested...&quot; was all he said and he left, he got back in his ship to eat anyway because that psycho bounty hunder might kill him and then he realised he royaly messed his chance up so bad, he was a FREAKING BLOOD DRAGON! &quot;AUGH! ****IT!!&quot; of all the people that could get his life back on track, he had to shoo him away and get a takeout lunch (which was now cold) he threw the box on the floor ran in the door on his way out and nearly forgot to lock it, he had to find him, it was his only chance to get back into piracy. and if the corsairs would still be mad, he didnt mind staying on kyoto base for a while.
<br />moments later, re ran to a hallway and he saw him &quot;sweet! i found him!&quot; he thought and then it happned the airlock closed he ran to the guy next to the door and asked, hey! this going to manhatten, i need to get on! QUICK!&quot; &quot;mmmmm too late. just missed it.&quot; he looked out the window and he could see the thrusterfire of his last hope... gone. he punched the man in the face out of anger, he was out cold, and he walked calmly back to the bar, still hungry.

<br />he thought it wouldent be a bad idea to land on the yukon, he knew somebody there he could sneak to and get some money (which he really needed seeing he traded 2 of his weapons for a fake ID) only to see the remains of it go and burn...
<br />he had seen the explosion from the astroid field so he crused over to try save his friend but it appears he may have escaped, he opened his scanner window and say it &quot;Outcasts - Sabre&quot; he did a cargo scan and noticed he couldent get through he would stalk the bastard until he landed and kill him, he had to hurry tho, that sabre was on the move.</div>

<br />I sleeped a lot on the way (again), i woke up in the tradeline to California Minor while we had some more escorting liberty navy around us. Helliot said to me that we must land their and wait till things are set right by planet mojave.
<br />&quot;i think they have a new type off battleship out their, but they don't want to let someone know about it... another strange thing is that i have heard that liberty has locked it's jumpgates to kusari and rheinland...&quot;
<br />
<br />i thought still that i'm stuck in here, i wanna go back to kyoto base, my home base...
<br />
<br />We landed on planet California Minor, but are not allowed to exit the ships...</div>

			<div class="content">Lance James/Barracuda/Cortez Jump gate in Cali/BHG Guildmaster
<br />
<br />Lance: (destroys a crusader) WTF? They just keep coming and coming. *switches to a secure channel* This is BH Ioda 1-1 to commanders of <i>Nebraska</i> and <i> Kentucky</i>. We can't take their whole fleet, we have to disable the jump gate.
<br />
<br />Nebraska commander: Roger that. We've already dispatched a Defender squad to disable the gate from their side, but we've havent heard from them since.
<br />
<br />Lance: Roger that. Requesting permission to obtain the deactivation codes and rescue the pilots if possible
<br />
<br />Nebraska commander: We're desperate. Permission granted. Uploading code 1 now...done
<br />
<br />Kentucky commander: Uploading code 2...upload complete. Be advised, they're attacking wave by wave. Your best chance is to go right after the next wave comes through
<br />
<br />Lance: Roger that...They're about to launch the next wave, Ioda wing head for the gate.
<br />
<br />All Ioda wing members: Roger.
<br />
<br />Lance: Here's the plan. Ioda 1-2 and 1-3 enter the codes, While the others cover you. Ill join the cover group once I finish searching for survivors....OK the next wave is through. Let's go....

<br />
<br />Richard justdidnt see the point with all these cloaking divices ,they had developed from the rienland ships that defected during the nomad crisis, they just didnt attack manhatten. Well orders were orders.
<br />
<br />His squadren as well as 4 others cloaked and escoeted the battleship 'lancashire' towards the cortez gate, since the other squad had taken out the yukon and the rest of the navy were at the meggelan gate only one thing stoped the second battle goup from coming through, the battleship 'Misuri'.
<br />
<br />It lasted for 10 seconds the squadrens had closed and fires there sunslayer torpedos at close range it never stood a chance. Now 7 more battleships and there squadrens came through the gate. All theships cl&#246;sed formation cloaked and entered the trade lane hading for los angels.
<br />
<br />The fleet decloaked on a hadful of defenders and one sabre
<br />&quot;ok this is going to be tougth&quot; Rich said on the comm
<br />the other ships had disposedof the defenders rich opend the comm
<br />&quot;All ships target the sabre&quot;He ordered and opend fire him self
<br />the sabre lasted a while weaving in and out of the fire and destroying the crusaders but eventually its sheilds fell and its cannons exploded
<br />&quot;Listen mate&quot; Rich said over the comm&quot;We just got word that the last surviving liberty battleship in this system is retrting this system is now bretoinian surrender or you will be destroyed&quot;....
<br />
<br />Note:There now then evry one i think the batlle will move to new ork P.S im in spain at the moment at an internet cafe so sorry i havent been on for a while</div>

			<div class="content">Jack Simmons/Liberty Rogues/Dagger (continued)
<br />
<br />  He had to play everything to his advantage: first, this was the Badlands, low sensor efficiency and radiation.  That meant a low chance of reinforcements.  Second, his fighter could nip past the them and weave through the rock formations.  Thirdly, Max was in the back.  He could launch mines more accurately than the computers.
<br />  Jack veered left and fired a half-hearted volley at one defender.  The Drails managed to wear the shields down slightly, but this was not the point.  If there's one thing navy pilots hated, it was a taunt.  Jack knew this and had lured many to their death in this way.  The defenders reacted as expected, pursuing the dagger in a downward spiral.  The fight carried on for a few minutes, Max dropping mines, some hitting, but most missing, all the while radiation eating away at the hull.  Soon, there was only one left, but this one knew what he was doing.  He immediately fled.  Jack wouldn't be giving chase: the ship was already gaining a greenish tint.  This left him to finish the job.  Some odds and ends but, more importantly, cardamine, were his.  Neither Jack nor Max took the stuff.  Jack, because he knew the risks, and Max, because cardamine was a powerful bartering item to addicts, much like ancient armies and cigarettes back on modern earth.
<br />  A cool profit, upgrades and some repairs later, Max and Jack squandered the rest on drinks for their buddies.  The boss was pleased, and invited them back to his office.  It turned out he had quite the proposal.
<br />
<br />&quot;We'll do it,&quot; said Max.
<br />
<br />&quot;OK, here's the deal.  Travel out to the Gallileo system, you're going to Padua.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You've already told us that...&quot; replied Jack.
<br />
<br />&quot;I know.  You'll be disrupting military convoys with the hackers.  I know it's dangerous, but we'll pay you good.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;How much is good?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Say, 2000 credits a convoy.  This'll loosen Liberty control and weaken their forces.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So we're helping the Bretonians?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;NO!  We're doing the exact same thing in Magellan!&quot;</div>

ENRICO!! but he was going to manhatten, jason would get him a renovated ship, and off he would fly away, getting rid of all hope, and manhatten was sucidal too... he tried it, he was going to manhatte, and then, he was going to kusari!!!</div>

<br />Almost by the jumpgate to new york, a cruiser blocks the way and we asked premission to jump, he accepted and here we go, onto new york...
<br />
<br />i talked a little with the pilot, what we have in the cargohold and sug...
<br />
<br />Helliot said to me that we have some consumer goods in the cargo hold and that that is going into storage on planet manhgattan, and that she stays their till furter orders and hoped she go back to the cortez system...
<br />
<br />i hoped the same for me to kyoto base... but well...
<br />
<br />she told me that planet manhattan is a planet with an enormous population.
<br />
<br />we exitted the tradeline to westpoint,
<br />Helliot; &quot;this is the academy for navy pilots, from here they ly also into the badlands, the place where rogues rule the place... they believe that they have a base inside that land... but nobody knows for sure.&quot;
<br />
<br />me; &quot;i never been on a rogues base, so i don't know if they have a base in here... i heard from some hackers that they like the rogues in new york system, for the nearby heavy transporters...&quot;
<br />
<br /><i>entering the tradeline to planet manhattan. </i>
<br />
<br />Helliot; &quot;you are a pirate??? or just a zoner, or a junker??&quot;
<br />
<br />me; &quot;don't worry, i'm from the blood dragons, and i was stuck at mactan base... i lost my own dragon on that base, i lost also a dagger some later... i hope i ever can go back to kusari space...&quot;
<br />
<br />Helliot; &quot;ah, ok... i heard that kusari has realy nice clouds, and that they have a lot off people who goes to kusari for vacation... and thought that the blood dragons where the royal guards with where destroyed in the past...&quot;
<br />
<br />me; &quot;we are still fighting to get our past back... but their is still nothng what is going into the right way...&quot;
<br />
<br />we exitted the tradeline nearby manhattan and waiting to dock at planet manhattan.

<br />the wonders of a fake ID he was on manhatten, and he asked around when the latest transport arrived, what it was carrin and took a temp job as a waiter for some stupid coffie shop, luckly no cops went there so he was safe and the wage was really good, 60 an hr.
<br />he wondered, who was Jack? he recalled the outcasts name being Carl and where did he go? he asked but the shop owner said thats most likely classified he asked for a 15 min break and to use a computer, mabe he could hack his way in and find out what and who this Jack guy is, and what hes doing with HIS sabre.</div>

<br />Lance: System jump successful...
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-1: Why aren't the Bretonians...oh the don't know we're with Liberty...yet
<br />
<br />Lance: Alright Ioda wing. Do your stuff...they might realise whats going on at any moment
<br />
<br />Lance activates his tractor beam and picks up the escape pods from the defenders that were assigned to shut down the Cortez gate as well as from a couple of Crusaders they were able to take out
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-3: We've entered the codes. Time to go...
<br />
<br />Lance: Acknowledged. Everybody into the gate
<br />
<br />The Ioda wing enters the gate right before it shuts down from the Bretonians' side
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-2: So boss, found anything?
<br />
<br />Lance: Yep. Survivors and some prisoners
<br />
<br />Ioda 1-2: Good, the employers are gonna be...
<br />
<br />The Ioda wing enters the California system to see 7 Bretonian battleships, a whole lot of Bretonian fighters with just one badly damaged Sabre fighting them and the remaints of the Liberty fleet retreating in the background
<br />
<br />Lance: Oh *****. Luckily they don't know we're with Liberty yet...maybe we could slip through...

<br />&quot; Ah! Heres the jumphole to Califonia&quot; Kiron made the jump at headed to the nearest trade lane. Docking at LA, he went towards the bar for a drink. It was time for a nice rest on a planet instead of a base. Taking a quick look, he noticed that none of the Liberty people seem to be worried about the invasion. He took a sip of his drink and looked at his map. &quot; The trip to New York shoulnt be too hard, With the police and navy busy with the war at Magellan and the rest of the Califonia System, he shoulnt have any problem slipping into New York without much problem with the cardamine purchased from a nearby rogue base. Thats what ill do...&quot; Kiron though tto himself
