			<div class="content">Hello Community! 
<br />
<br />Ok so I've been playing a good amount of FL over the last few days and I have persistent nagging questions. If the l337 pilots out there can lend me some of their wisdom, I would be much obliged <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Currently, I'm a level 10 pilot, and am flying a Cavalier Light Fighter. 
<br />
<br />[SPOILER!!
<br />I have just finished the mission where the Rheinland defectors helped me escape back to planet Leeds. 
<br />[/SPOILER!!
<br />
<br />Here are my questions:
<br />
<br />General:
<br />1. Is it possible to explore the whole universe as a level 10 pilot, or do I need to advance in the SP missions to access other parts of the universe? 
<br />
<br />2. What benefit is there to 'leveling up'?
<br />
<br />Weapons:
<br />1. What do the classes mean? At the Equipment Dealer's, In my weapon load-out screen, there are guns of class X while the hardpoints are labeled as class Y, for example.  Why?
<br />
<br />2. Are countermeasures/mines useful? I just bought a heavy thruster and weave/dodge like a madman when I hear 'incoming missile' and usually don't get hit... Any comments?
<br />
<br />3. When trying to buy some heavier duty weapons, though I can afford them, I'm told my ship doesn't have a hardpoint that can handle the equipment, or something to that effect. Do I need a different ship?
<br />
<br />4. After finishing a battle and looting the wreckage, I often get a 'tractor failed' message, which sucks. Why? I get this message despite plenty of room in cargo/nanobots/shield batteries...
<br />
<br />5. What is a good weapon combo? How do I know which factions use which kinds of weapons so I can shop accordingly?
<br />
<br />6. Is it just me or are missiles useless? How do I get weapon lock, or otherwise successfully hit a target with a missile without having to be within 100m of said target?
<br />
<br />Ships:
<br />1. What is the significance of 'optimal class' when you look at your ship's details?
<br />
<br />2. Can I fly out to a remote part of the universe, as a level 10 pilot, and buy a Very Heavy Fighter if I have the credits (which I don't <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> )? Like a Falcon for example?
<br />
<br />3. What are the additional components abbreviated as &quot;CM&quot; &quot;CD&quot; CD/T&quot; (or something)?
<br />
<br />Trading: 
<br />1. What is the best way to make some coin? Doing missions for 5K at a time seems like drops of water in a bucket when you consider the price tag of some ships is 500,000+ credits...
<br />
<br />2. Would it be worth it to start over from the beginning and try to accumulate a massive amount of wealth before pressing forward with the SP missions?
<br />
<br />Sorry, I can see that's already a huge amount of questions. If someone is kind enough to take the time to answer them clearly, I will be forever grateful.
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot, happy freelancing!!!
<br />

			<div class="content"><i>1. Is it possible to explore the whole universe as a level 10 pilot, or do I need to advance in the SP missions to access other parts of the universe? 
<br />
<br />2. What benefit is there to 'leveling up'? </i>
<br />
<br />Once you get past the Liberty section you pretty much have full access. Some jump holes which feature in the SP storyline aren't open to you since it would ruin the story, and I even came across a Planet - Spraque that had no docking ring when I found it but later, in SP it will.
<br />
<br />But the level you are at dictates what ships you can fly and what weapons you can  buy (although you can salvage weapons that you don't have buy rights to). So there are definately parts of the universe you'd be foolish to go wandering in with only a Bretonia HF, for example, since you'll get swarmed by enemies packing much more punch than you.
<br />
<br />That's what leveling up is all about - getting access to the stuff you'll need to survive in the really hostile places.
<br />
<br /><i>1. What do the classes mean? At the Equipment Dealer's, In my weapon load-out screen, there are guns of class X while the hardpoints are labeled as class Y, for example. Why? </i>
<br />
<br />Each ship can take a certain number of weapons of set classes. You cannot put a level 7 weapon on a ship that has a level 6 slot as it's maxium. While in general a higher level weapon will be more powerful than a lower ;evel weapon, some folks have found advantages (less popwer usuage) in using lower level weapons at times. Comes down to personal taste and doing the maths on damage done/fire rate/energy usuage.
<br />
<br />With a class there is also variation in weapons - i.e. all level 7 weapons are not created equal. Often the weakest weapons in any level class are on the main trade routes, while if you go futher into the wilderness (borderworlds) you'll find weapons of the same class that are slightly more powerful/longer range/less power hungry.
<br />
<br />It is ALWAYS advisable to check your weapon collection after a fight - often you will have picked up better weapons than you've got.
<br />
<br /><i>2. Are countermeasures/mines useful? I just bought a heavy thruster and weave/dodge like a madman when I hear 'incoming missile' and usually don't get hit... Any comments? </i>
<br />
<br />Use of the thruster and weaving dodging would be my first tactic, but missiles do get better (as do countermeasures). Countermeasures do work but you need to deploy them as late as possible, then change direction. Think the Hunt for Red October, only much much faster.
<br />
<br />Mines I've had so so lucj with. Frankly I tend to forghet about them when I could probably put them to good use. 
<br />
<br />The best counter measure I've found is to not become &quot;target fixated&quot;. I.E., there's no point staying on that bogey's tail hammering away if 3 other bogey's are on yours doing the same. Break off, run at them and do some damage then lock back on.
<br />
<br /><i>3. When trying to buy some heavier duty weapons, though I can afford them, I'm told my ship doesn't have a hardpoint that can handle the equipment, or something to that effect. Do I need a different ship? </i>
<br />
<br />2 things. First, you must have a free hardpoint = the game won't automatically replace a currently laoded weapon with a new one. So make sure you've freed up a hard point first by clicking on the little icon on the loaded weapon.
<br />
<br />Secondly, your desired weapon must match your slots. If you are chossing a level 7 weapon, and only have level 6 slots on your ship then it aint gonna happen.
<br />
<br /><i>4. After finishing a battle and looting the wreckage, I often get a 'tractor failed' message, which sucks. Why? I get this message despite plenty of room in cargo/nanobots/shield batteries... </i>
<br />
<br />That message usually means you do not have any more room for the particular item you are trying to tractor. That's pretty much it.
<br />
<br /><i>5. What is a good weapon combo? How do I know which factions use which kinds of weapons so I can shop accordingly? </i>
<br />
<br />Trial and error. Just play aroudn and find a combo that feels good. Or painstakingly use a claculator to work out the uktimate combo.
<br />
<br /><i>6. Is it just me or are missiles useless? How do I get weapon lock, or otherwise successfully hit a target with a missile without having to be within 100m of said target? </i>
<br />
<br />Never use em. There are good tactics - fire at close range while goijng head to head ect, but you use up money for negliable returns IMHO. I go guns.
<br />
<br />
<br /><i>Trading: 
<br />1. What is the best way to make some coin? Doing missions for 5K at a time seems like drops of water in a bucket when you consider the price tag of some ships is 500,000+ credits... </i>
<br />
<br />You need to explore explore explore so you can find a good trade route that isn't too dangeros for your current status. Then make the most of it. Exploration is the crucial thing wiht trading. Without it you're just making cheapo milk runs for pennies.
<br />
<br /><i>2. Would it be worth it to start over from the beginning and try to accumulate a massive amount of wealth before pressing forward with the SP missions? </i>
<br />
<br />Depends if you've git the patience. I took  time out from Sp when in Bretonia and made 800k. That really helped later on because I never had to worry about money to by anything I wanted for the rest of SP.</div>

			<div class="content">Making lots of bank in during the story is only sorta useful though.  For one thing, the story will jack around with your reputation a lot, so don't get attached to it.  Second, you're still limited in the good stuff you can buy by level, which only goes up with the story.
<br />
<br />That being said, the last three missions of the story have little opportunity to make money, and just buying shield batteries gets expensive when you burn through entire loads in a battle <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  The good news is that most supplies are cheap.

			<div class="content">Those are some excellent answers! I wish I'd read a post like this when I started the game <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I'll add my own input to some of the questions:
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Are countermeasures/mines useful? I just bought a heavy thruster and weave/dodge like a madman when I hear 'incoming missile' and usually don't get hit... Any comments?
<br />
<br />I had good luck with them. I got an advanced dropper fairly early, and when I remembered to use it I rarely got hit by missiles. I don't know how to tell how close a missile is, so when I get the warning I drop a flare and veer to one side.
<br />
<br />5. What is a good weapon combo? How do I know which factions use which kinds of weapons so I can shop accordingly?
<br />
<br />I went for a mix of 2-3 weapon types plus 1 missile on a heavy fighter. 2 fast firing lasers, 2 high hull damage, and one of whatever else looked good. I never bothered much with the shield-specific weapons, since shields usually dropped after my first volley.
<br />
<br />6. Is it just me or are missiles useless? How do I get weapon lock, or otherwise successfully hit a target with a missile without having to be within 100m of said target?
<br />
<br />I like em. The Catapult missiles do massive hull damage while being not too expensive (I think 350 or so each). For the enemies that charge right at me, I can drop their shields as they approach and fire off a missile right before they veer off. They run right into it, and if they don't die outright they're severely damaged. 
<br />
<br />Ships:
<br />1. What is the significance of 'optimal class' when you look at your ship's details?
<br />
<br />I'm wondering that myself. I ignored it and went with the most destructive weapons I could find, which were usually the highest class. (but not always...)
<br />
<br />2. Can I fly out to a remote part of the universe, as a level 10 pilot, and buy a Very Heavy Fighter if I have the credits (which I don't  )? Like a Falcon for example?
<br />
<br />Nope, you're limited by your level.
<br />
<br />3. What are the additional components abbreviated as &quot;CM&quot; &quot;CD&quot; CD/T&quot; (or something)?
<br />
<br />CM = countermeasure, CD = cruise disrupter, T = torpedo
<br />
<br />2. Would it be worth it to start over from the beginning and try to accumulate a massive amount of wealth before pressing forward with the SP missions?
<br />
<br />Up to you. I did the SP missions as they came for most of the campaign and never had cash problems til near the end, when there was no chance to earn extra money. (Had to seriously slow down my missile addiction...)</div>

			<div class="content">In regards to Optimal Class for ships:
<br />
<br />If your ship has a Max Power rating of 10, but an optimal Power Rating of 8, I think it means that you can mount Level 10 items, but it will drain power really fast.  The power system will support sustained fire with Level 8 weapons.
<br />
<br />That is just my interpretation.
<br />
<br />For Cash:  I'm currently going through the SP the second time.  I'm in Bretonia now, and I've stopped to build up cash.  I found a trade route that nets 120k per round trip with the Bretonian Freighter.    It's pretty exciting since I've ticked off just about every outlaw faction and the Bounty Hunters.   The 'z' Key along with Afterburners and liberal use of turrets, has saved my life.</div>
