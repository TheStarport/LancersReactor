			<div class="content">guys, thanks for continuing on. especially w/ the engin kill thing. especially as rebalance if my fav mod. evo is close but the upgrades seem like a pale comparison. no personality to them.
<br />
<br />a few questions:
<br />1. will there be new commodities (hopefully done w/ humor as well as serious ones).
<br />2. will the pricing and lvl requirements be leveled out? needing to be 13th lvl to buy a two-gun shield3 shuttle doesn't seem right. 
<br />3. will there be new systems?
<br />4. new factions?
<br />5. new ships that look like they were built w/ some logical thought, not becaue         &quot;IT LOOKS REALLY REALLY COOL!&quot; and &quot;BECAUSE i CAN DO IT&quot; kind of shipwrighting. ergo, the starting ship.
<br />6. Please finish off the unknown systems! rebalance is the only mod I know of that has done anything w/ the monkeys. can you make both factions in their own right? they're already there after all.
<br />
<br />if you want to talk ideas/concepts I would love to chat w/ you guys.
<br />Shawn Barry</div>

<br />thnxs for the hint about the Titan. I never flew one of these - hey, who was the first one with the signature &quot;Titan flies like a cow&quot; ? BP ?) - flying milkpots <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> But if it's worth more than 100 Mio I could be tempted to give the Titan a try.

			<div class="content">Hey, alright comrades, my apologies for the delay in responding.  In the past 96 hours, I've gotten about 10 hrs sleep -- the rest = FL <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  So we've made some progress.
<br />
<br />Alrighty, now to answer your questions, Shawn:
<br />
<br /><i>a few questions:  </i>
<br /><i>1. will there be new commodities (hopefully done w/ humor as well as serious ones).  </i>
<br /><b>Well, I sent an email requesting permission to implement the BlackMarket Mod into the patch, but I have not heard from the mod's creator. So ... *wince* I <i>might  </i> add some from there, but I can add some new ones myself.  Any specific ideas .. ? Please post some if you'd like something in particular put in there.  </b>
<br />
<br /><i>2. will the pricing and lvl requirements be leveled out? needing to be 13th lvl to buy a two-gun shield3 shuttle doesn't seem right.  </i>
<br /><b>Yes, the lvl-reqs at least will be more balanced. I've already edited some ships and equipment, but please post any specific ones (ie one of htose that you see and say &quot;ooo, can't wait to get that -- but dang it, stupid lvlcap.&quot; ) And I couldn't find the shuttle on Houston. Do you know the name of it? Prices need work, so I'll give those a look, too.  </b>
<br />
<br /><i>3. will there be new systems?  </i>
<br /><b>Well, I'm afraid that due to time constraints (I can only mod until the first week in January, then I have to go back to school <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> ), there aren't going to be any new systems. BUT see below for more on systems.  </b>
<br />
<br /><i>4. new factions?  </i>
<br /><b>I've been itching to add new factions for months, but I have not had time to really.  I am working on make the Monkeys and the Robos, at least, their own factions. They'll have more custom stuff, maybe ships assigned to them, some weaps, equip, etc. Maybe one will, as an outsider, a group that has sat back and observed those foolish humans fighting each others' capships, maybe one of them will have a &quot;cap-ship buster&quot; <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I am not sure about other factions besides them, though ... Not 100% sure yet.   </b>
<br />
<br /><i>5. new ships that look like they were built w/ some logical thought, not becaue &quot;IT LOOKS REALLY REALLY COOL!&quot; and &quot;BECAUSE i CAN DO IT&quot; kind of shipwrighting. ergo, the starting ship.  </i>
<br /><b>Yes, there are already some new ships. ArchKaine's <i>Wrath  </i> Space-Superiority Fighter already mentioned.  The Serafina Freighter is in, too. There are some others from a couple of other mods (very cool ones, in my opinion) but there are already so many in the game that nobody uses (all those Taiidan or Somotaw or whatever hte heck those butt-ugly box ships are called (the ones that used to be sold on Trenton and Newark ... *shudder* hideous, and flew like the Death Star loaded with banthas and without half of its thrusters <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>). There wll be a few more, though. I'll have a list before too much longer. </b>  I am not very fond of the Starskipper, either -- not to stomp on Baene's toes, but I just do not care for that thing.  The starting ship is now the <i>Serapis  </i> LF from Freespace 2. I edited its model and its entry in shiparch to make it a better fighter than it was. It has better stats (and looks <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) than the Starskipper - higher maneuverability, better speed, its own weapons from Freespace.  It's better in my opinion. How does that sound?
<br />
<br /><i>6. Please finish off the unknown systems! rebalance is the only mod I know of that has done anything w/ the monkeys. can you make both factions in their own right? they're already there after all.  </i>
<br /><b>I'm working on completing hte Unknown systems right now.  There are going to be Monkey and Robot features in the lower one (maybe bases, patrols, encounters, etc).  There <i>might  </i> be a Nomad base in hte upper pink Unknown, but not sure on that one, either. But yeah, these systems will be better and more complete <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  </b>
<br />
<br />
<br />And I fervently hope to complete this mod by the 1st week in January.  I am not certain yet (ArchKaine's internet's - er, rather, the Nazi-esque brother that controls the internet - is being <i>difficult  </i>, to put it nicely), but we are working hard on things.
<br />AH, and please keep listing any little specific things - infocards, HPs, prices, lvl-requirements, etc. - that need fixing.
<br />**And do any of you guys have some suggestions for the names of the monkey and robo factions? I'm not calling them &quot;Monkeys&quot; and &quot;Robots,&quot; I'll say that much right now <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. But if you have any good ones for them, please post those, too.
<br />
<br />Thanks, you guys, for your help and your continued interest <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  I appreciate it.  I am working hard to make the game we love a little better, a little more interesting, a tad more challenging here and there.  I hope we can suceed in that respect <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />I will keep you posted. Until then, mis amigos, 
<br />    ~ Ro9ue out ~

			<div class="content">Ello Gents, Well i got the next five days off from work, and I'm gonna try out my moddin hands.  If it works well, I'll let ya know.  I have prior exp with this sorta thing(Imodded my SFC3, changed gun hardpoint placement, stats, workin models, got ones that wouldn't work to work, But never created new ships, not my cup of tea)  So if i can do this modding thing correctly and good, i'll let ya know, who knows mayby I can take some of the weight off yer shoulders.  The other Question I have is, who gonna run this server, and what kinda speks that person's comp got.  I got 512+k of ram a 1700+ Cpu, a Dsl and win2k and I have the funds to possibly get a Kick Arse Server Computer, would prolly have to goto cable modem so i can have the other Comp to be strictly a Server Computer, but nothing's definante, cause i really don't know the actual numbers needed to do that sort a thing.</div>

			<div class="content">Hey guys, more news.
<br />I have added a lot of new ships, some neat ones from Epsilon mod included.  There are now 3 new factions: 
<br />
<br /><i>the Primal Harbingers </i>, a group of former Bowex pilots (rather primative, if you know what I mean <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) who ventured out into the outer rim to expand trading horizons.  After Planet Prima (in Corsair Uknown) was settled by former-Bowex members, venturous merchants expanded to a neighboring planet. On its desolate and frozen surface, they unveiled a vast network of astounding ziggurats and edifices. They soon determined that the planet had been a Dom K'Vosh holy city, a final place of purification and blessing before their retreat from the known Sirius sector. Excavating the ancient yet miraculously preserved artifacts, scrolls, and religious teachings of the K'Vosh in high hopes of selling them, the awe-strucken merhcants found themselves delving whole-heartedly into the principles and doctrines of the K'Vosh religion. Its all-encompassing and  inquisitive dogmas on the nature and the meaning of existance struck wistful chords in the merchants hearts. They eventaully established the Primal Harbingers cult, demanding that their brethren accept their views, that they return to the Colonies to spread the faith - or eliminate those who refused The Truth. The righteous and dignified gentility of the initial founders of the faith soon died away, devolving into a maniacal cult bent on the &quot;holy order&quot; to either convert or subvert any and all they can reach.
<br />
<br /><i>The Arboreal Coalition </i>, the remainder of these fanatic chimps' shipping partners and co-pilots, established trading posts near the Harbingers' activites so that they could keep them in check.  A lone Bretonian explorer, son of a prominent Bowex executive, stumbled upon the Imbraani system roughly a century after the arrival in Sirius. Retaining connections with his father's corporation, he established his own shipping company in the outer fringes of the Colonies, catering primarily to the entrepreneurs and the criminal factions. However, with the  rise of the Primal Harbinger cult in the Imbraani system, the company underwent a radical shift of purpose and focus. Abhorring the cult's fascination and allegiance with the Nomads, viewing their adherance to newly discovered Dom K'Vosh religious teachings with disappointed contempt, the group of merchants formed the Arboreal Coaltion. The Coalition devotes its resources to constraining the Harbingers, attempting to prevent their religious zeal and fervor from leaking to other colonists. The Coalition backs its campaigns and undying resistance by maintaining shipping lines in several outer systems, acting as an extension of Bowex.
<br />
<br />And <i>Menhit Squadron </i>, a large hierarchal group of bio-droids of unprecedented AI lvls. Menhit Squadron, an advanced series of bio-droids manufactured on Toledo, was created by The Order to assist in its suppression of the Nomads once the Primal Harbinger cult surfaced. Orillion and some of his former associates from the Navy managed to access all of Liberty's advances in artifical intelligence when they nabbed Battleship Isis. They put this knowledge to good use, desiging an AI system that can observe its surroundings, interpret nearly any signal or stimulus, and then make decisive decisions thanks to a higher-complexity processor core. The Menhits, somewhat left on their own to fulfill their purpose, design their own combat systems and equipment, remaining largely autonomous from their creators and militant superiors in all regards except for military hierarchy and an instilled hatred of Nomads.
<br />
<br />The Coalition will have some bases scattered here and there, but not all over the place - their main goal is to limit the crazy bastard monkey turncoats (er, rather turntails <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>).  Note that each of these factions is connected in some way to the other: The Harbingers are allied with Nomads, and the Menhits are boud pretty tightly with The Order. The Coalition stands alonside The ORder and the Menhits to oppose the Nomads/Harbingers.  The Coalition acts as a limited-scope Bowex in the very outer edge systems.
<br />Each faction has its own fighters and ships (most of 'em new - and if I might say so, pretty badazz ). I want to add Battleship encounters, but I can't be sure if I'll get them working ... I'm gonna try hard on that one!
<br />
<br />~ Hey, what gunboat problem are we talking about specifically? I have not gotten to the Bretonian part of the story yet - been waiting to finish the first version of the addon to jump in. Sorry, I just need a few details to fill me in <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Is it a loadout prob?
<br />~ I have added nebulae, and I can add more that do damage -- BUT FL makes damage to your hull automatically, and I'm not exactly sure how to change that ... <img src=smilies/icon_smile_question.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> So I can still add some nifty things in there (already have in some systems) - I personally like Galileo and Kepler, that dark, ominous, dangerous feel to them, actually feels how I think most parts of space are like out there.
<br />
<br />That'll be cool of you want to help, Darquies; lemme know what exactly you'd like to work on, and I can send you the most recent and updated files from the Addon so that we don't have to do stupid compilation .. ugh, hate doing that! If you want to balance out the level and pricing system, I still have not completed that yet, so .. if you're interested <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> it's still free. And just let me know what you (any of ya guys) would like to help with.
<br />
<br />We should/could have a beta version released in the next couple of days -- it can be an on-time Christmas present! <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> But the final version is still a few days off at least. Got a crapload to still do, been pulling all-nighters for 4 days straight now ... z..z.z <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sleepy.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />Keep talking, my friends, and we'll have Rebal breathing fire again <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br /><b>Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! </b> - now back to the files <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

My email address is <!-- e --><a href="mailto:darquies@yahoo.com">darquies@yahoo.com</a><!-- e --> pls include any revelant info that you want me to handle with what ever you need help with.  Also i think we could use the LR teamspeak server, when you and I are modding(besides 1 and a 1/2 brains are better than 1)  So If you want to set up a future time that you know you will be moddin, let me know, and we can meet on Teamspeak and handle our Biznezz

			<div class="content">Arg, ok, sry abuot wait.  I <i>thought </i> I posted a message yesterday afternoon, but the dang thing isn't here .. <img src=smilies/icon_smile_angry.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>  Ah, well. here's an update:
<br />
<br />There are a few more ships (cool ones, a few from Epsilon Mod) that the new factions are flyin'.  A LOT of new weapons and shields/other goodies for more intersting play. 
<br />I had to go back and start over on the revent work because I got a nasty CTD when I added the new factions, the new ships, and the new weaps at one time. So I've been debugging the danged stuff for all of today.  But we're almost done now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> I hope to soon have encounters with custom ships, factions, and equipment in the new systems before too much longer (next day, maybe 2?)
<br />
<br />I want to send you the files I have right now (itching to just ship 'em to ya right now) but as they are right now, you'll crash. I have to figure out a bug (think it's an equip one, wrong name/typo/little tihng like that somewhere in the weap_equip, goods, or other EQUIPMENT file), then finish adding the encounters.  Is that too long to wait?  If you wouldn't mind doing so, you can add the new commodities (or I can add them and you can spread them out in game). They'll need to be sold on a few bases, bought for a decent (and then occasional high - ) prices on a few bases, and maybe make some people carry them. ... Er, how does that sound? <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> If it's too much, we can work on the mod server or on AIM or something like that.
<br />Ah, and btw, I am in Texas, so I am also in Central time.  Heh, oops, it's 4:04 am, Christmas morning now Central time ... might have to hit it her <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I'll drop y'all another note tomorrow (X-mas day) and give an update. 
<br />Servers are great! Anyone who would like to beta the addon is welcome to it. I'll make a list and email it to the server admins, and .. then maybe you guys can disseminate it for your servers?  Or perhaps we can get bakedpotato to post it on TLR. I have an angelfire site, but it's only 20 MB and those are being used for the first Aten Addon...
<br />Anywho, I'll check back in for duty in a few hours ... nevermind sleep - got enough to do as it is <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> I take Thomas Jefferson's viewpoint: life's a little short to spend sleeping and lying about. I'd rather be a little tired and have a lot going on (and getting done) than fart around... Sry, off my personal soapbox <img src=smilies/icon_smile_tongue.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br /><b><i>Merry Christmas </i> </b>, mis compadres. I hope to be flying alongside yas before too much longer <img src=smilies/icon_smile_wink.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />Installed 2 super trade routes (profit potential of 8k per unit)  But it's not easy (IMHO)
<br />
<br />As you will see, $500.oo  profit routes are all over the place, there are some 1k and above, but you'll have to drive some.
<br />
<br />I can make more Super trade routes, but i don't advise more than 5
<br />
<br />Ro9ue pls give me your email so i can send you the Market_Commodities File.
