			<div class="content">OOC: Man, I'm so long-winded.  Give me the three ghosts of X-mas and call me Charles Dickens.  Back on subject, it's really long again, but I've added to Nick's post to cement the reunion.  Also, Malys, I brought the GC (and where they go follow the Dragons) to Malaga Base.  This would be a good place to jump in.  Enjoy, y'all
<br />
<br />IC:
<br />
<br />Hazily, Quigley started to come back to consciousness.  He was lying in a soft bed all tucked in.  He could feel one of his hands being held lightly by a smaller, more delicate hand.  Quigley gave the hand a squeeze and felt the warmth and soft skin of the petite hand.  Then a soft, caring voice summoned him out of his stupor.  &quot;Matthew?  Matt?  Are you awake?&quot;
<br />
<br />Quigley opened his eyes to see Rachel sitting by his bed, leaning in towards him.  Her short red hair was freshly washed because Quigley could smell the sweet shampoo.  She was wearing another flight suit as she always did, but she hadn't zipped it all the way to her throat.  Quigley smiled up at her.  &quot;I feel like Rip Van Winkle.  How long have I been out?&quot;
<br />
<br />Rachel smiled back and her green eyes glowed.  &quot;Oh, you've been a Captain Sleepy-head for the last three days.  You even managed to sleep through a minor fleet action.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What?  What fleet action?&quot; Quigley asked groggily.
<br />
<br />&quot;Remember what Evans said about having to save someone else?  Apparently, he had received another distress call from a squadron of Loyalist gunboats.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Wait, Loyalist gunboats?  Start over and expand the help files.&quot;
<br />
<br />Rachel rolled her eyes and told Quigley what had happened the last several days.  A coup d'etat had occurred in the Liberty government right after Mu flight had left West Point.  The former government was overthrown under the pretenses that it had been corrupted by criminal factions and pirates.  The new military regime promised to stop crime in Liberty all together.  Buffalo and Rochester had been totally wiped out the next day. 
<br />
<br />Evans spoke out against the coup saying that the military does not make policy changes that was duty of the citizens of Liberty's elected officials.  The new regime didn't like Evans' protest and ordered him arrested, but everyone at West Point was loyal to him and refused to obey LibCom's orders.  
<br />
<br />LibCom sent three cruisers to subdue West Point and arrest Evans.  After a short skirmish that left West Point in shambles, a mutiny occurred in Evans' command, and he was captured.  The mutineers brought what usable equipment and prisoners they had over to the main cruiser, the <i>Memphis  </i>.  Once the mutineers and prisoners had landed on the cruiser, Evans and the mutiny&#8217;s leaders were taken up to the <i>Memphis'  </i> bridge so the captain could gloat over the fallen hero.  
<br />
<br />To the captain's surprise, the whole mutiny was a ploy to get Evans and the West Point's personnel off the station and into something more mobile.  Evans then used the strategic mind that had made him famous on the <i>Rio Grande  </i> to cripple the other two cruisers and disappear into the Badlands.  That covered the history up to where the newly rechristened <i>West Point  </i> appeared and took out the traitorous Liberty cruiser above Atka.
<br />
<br />After Mu squadron's pick up, Evans had rushed off to respond to a distress call from a group of Liberty gunboats.  The Loyalist, for that's what people who supported the old government were being called, gunboats were being pursued by a flotilla of two cruisers and a dozen gunboats.  Evans arrival found the four remaining Loyalist gunboats trying to keep the flotilla off their backs.  The <i>West Point  </i> and her fighters were able to cover the gunboats retreat and get out of the system.  Now Evans had one cruiser and four battered gunboats in his small fleet.  Quigley half wondered how he'd like the <i>Vengeance  </i>.
<br />
<br />&quot;Okay, so we have that out of the way.  Where we going?&quot; Quigley asked still trying to understand all the news.
<br />
<br />&quot;I think I can answer that, Matt.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Admiral!&quot;  Quigley started to sit up, but Rachel put her hands on his shoulders and forced him back down.
<br />
<br />&quot;Matthew, don't move.  The doc said you're still really exhausted.  Don't use up your strength.&quot; Rachel admonished in a caring maternal way.
<br />
<br />Evans smiled, something Quigley hadn't seen often from his commander.  &quot;Better listen to the lieutenant, son.  She's spent as much time as she could at your side.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, She was here until we or flying tore her away.&quot; Wolfie commented as he leaned against the door.  Rachel blushed and sat back down.  As usual, Jimmy was right behind Wolfie in doing things, and he entered the room with Jezebel in tow.  Jezebel's face was streaked and red from what Quigley assumed was crying.
<br />
<br />&quot;With no further interruptions?&quot; Evans looked around the assembled to see if there were any objections.  He had none except from Jimmy who was waving him on in a mock aristocratic manner.  Evans raised an eyebrow, stared at the scrawny young man, and cleared his throat.  &quot;While you were out, I had Miss Merriweather, you know her as Jezebel, make contact with her associates.  Miss Merriweather was, as you know, a Xeno, but as leader of the Survivors she gained connections to many of the other criminal groups in Liberty and Rhienland.  About a day and a half ago, she received a message from a Mr. May.  Our records placed him with the Lane Hackers, but the crackdown on pirates has put him in command of the coalition of pirate and criminal remnants.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Evans walked closer and sat on the foot of the bed.  &#8220;The message was passed through the criminal comm network, but it was addressed to you, Captain.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley blinked, confused.  &#8220;How did this May find out about me?  I&#8217;ve never met anyone with that name and I&#8217;ve never been on good terms with the Lane Hackers.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, the message said you were recommended by a man by the name of Danson.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Danson?  That slippery eel, I figured he&#8217;d make it through hell unscathed.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, Mr. May&#8217;s message was to warn you of the impending hostility of Liberty, which you found about on your own.  He also invited you to join him.  He mentioned that you come highly recommend by Mr. Danson and another party.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Who is the galaxy likes me?  Other than the people on this ship and my friends from the <i>Vengeance </i>, everyone wants me dead.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Not everyone.  A Kusari woman landed on the <i>West Point  </i> to deliver this.&#8221;  Admiral Evans handed over a small rolled up scroll.  Quigley recognized it instantly; this was a note from the young empress-in-training of the Golden Chrysanthemums.  Although his time with the GC was still a painful reminder of Nazomi&#8217;s death, he was still loyal to the empress.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you to read your letter.  Anyways, Mu flight, I need you to escort us into Malaga Base.&#8221;  
<br />
<br />Evans turned and left the room.  Wolfie straightened up from the door and throw a half salute as he left the room.  Jimmy left Jezebel standing in the room as he jogged after his wingman.  He exited the room and then stuck a hand back in and waved good bye.  Rachel got up and walked to the door.  She stopped at the door and looked back at Quigley still in the bed.  She looked him the eyes in a silent farewell as she left.  Quigley looked after her, and the room was silent.
<br />
<br />Jezebel broke it as she sat down.  &#8220;She&#8217;s really fallen for you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley looked at her tear-stained face.  &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;  Quigley was a bit confused; Jezebel couldn&#8217;t be jealous of Quigley and Rachel, could she?  Jezebel looked away at the empty door.  &#8220;Mrs. Merriweather?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jezebel looked up and smiled weakly.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me that.  It&#8217;s bad enough that the old man is calling me by my real name.  There's a reason I go by Jezebel.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hmm&#8230;better pirate name.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jezebel smiled a little wider but just a little.  &#8220;Finally, someone who understands.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;So what&#8217;s up, Jezzie?&#8221; Quigley said with tired, lopsided grin.
<br />
<br />Jezebel raised her eyebrows at that.  Then while she was mustering up an answer her head went down.  Her chin rested on her chest as she spoke.  &#8220;Seeing you and Rachel reminds me of my lover.  I saw his ship explode when the Huns wiped out our base.  But there&#8217;s more.  I&#8217;ve lost everyone I love, cared about, laughed with, and even spit on.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;One of your ships made it out, a Hawk, right?&#8221; Quigley said trying to create some hope.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, Morrill, the guy who lead you in.  He was a great pilot as that last battle showed, but he&#8217;ll never fly again.  He sustained heavy damage to his limbs and lungs in the fight.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yeah, but his life isn&#8217;t over.  That little weasel will heal and find a new way to cheat and rob people without a fighter.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jezebel looked up again.  New tears were streaming down her face.  She quickly wiped them away.  &#8220;You&#8217;re right, but nothing will ever be the same.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley looked at her and chuckled.  &#8220;Jezebel, welcome to the data file that is my life.  I&#8217;ve had enough tragic twists in my life for ten people.  Two years into my time in West Point, my parents were killed in a speeder crash.  A year before I graduated, my brother was betrayed and murdered, and I was expelled from West Point.  I was sent away in disgrace from my friend and love and the only home I had left.  Since then I&#8217;ve been bouncing around the galaxy all alone.  I find a place to settle down and another soul mate, only to have it ripped away.  Then I bounce into the middle of the biggest plot of intrigue and murder in Sirius.  I&#8217;ve been at Death&#8217;s doorstep at least a hundred times in the past month.  I get back into my home, the Navy, only to have it betray all the loyalty I&#8217;ve given it.&#8221;  During Quigley&#8217;s tirade, Jezebel could only sit and stare at the battered but unbroken man that lay before her.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Quigley, I never knew, but&#8230;&#8221; A few tears began to appear.
<br />
<br />Quigley reached out and put his hand on her knee.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a tough life, but I know what you must be going through.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;How can you be so calm?  With all that has happened to you?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t know mostly because it has all happened to me.  The galaxy is going to have to get pretty creative to faze me because I&#8217;m not going to let it.  Are you going to be okay?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be okay,&#8221; Jezebel said softly.  Quigley noticed she didn&#8217;t have the confidence and fire that he had admired and pitted himself against before the battle on Atka.  He hoped she would be able to find it again.  Quigley figured she would need it in the near future.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you out there with the Mus?&#8221; Quigley asked innocently.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My ship&#8217;s shot to pieces.  So was Jimmy&#8217;s ship.  He&#8217;s been flying your Valkyrie&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Crap, I hope get it back with all its original pieces.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;He has an amazing talent for machinery and a sweet disposition.  He&#8217;s been helping me piece my Hawk together.&#8221; Jezebel said a little happy.  
<br />
<br /><i>So what you&#8217;re sweet on the kid now?  </i> Quigley thought.  &#8220;James is an incredible gearhead and techie.  I&#8217;ve known him for about the say time as you and he&#8217;s always got something new up his sleeve..&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jezebel laughed a little and pointed to the scroll in his hand.  &#8220;Like your hobby as an ultra-idealist.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s me.  I&#8217;ve got a talent of meeting the strangest people at odd and critical moments.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jezebel got up and stretched.  &#8220;I better let you read your letter and rest.  We&#8217;re an hour or two out from Malaga Base.&#8221;  The pirate woman left the room without looking back.
<br />
<br />&#8220;What?  No wave or kiss?  My charm must be failing.&#8221; Quigley yelled after her.
<br />
<br />Jezebel peaked back in.  She wore a mischievous grin.  &#8220;I can always call Admiral Evans.  I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be happy to give you a smooch.&#8221;  She cackled and ducked through door.
<br />
<br />Quigley shook his head and looked at the Kusari scroll.  It was sealed with the empress&#8217;s personal symbol.  He broke the seal and unrolled the message.   It contained the same beautiful, sweeping Kusari calligraphy that had been in Nazomi&#8217;s eulogy.  The past caused the pain to resurface again, but he still read the empress&#8217;s letter.  She said how she was relieved to find him among the living.  She recalled her memories of him as a valiant ronin that had aided her in the past.  She implored him to join the coalition Mr. May had organized and assured him he would be a great asset to the survival of all that was good.  She informed him that she was presently on the Malaga Base.  She asked he would come visit her at his convience.  A GC lieutenant would meet him at Malaga&#8217;s landing bay with his answer.
<br />
<br />Quigley set the letter on his chest and looked at the ceiling.  The galaxy was upside-down and against him, but least this time he had those how really mattered at his back.  He could count on Rachel, Mu Flight, Jezebel, the <i>Vengeance  </i> group, Evans and <i>West Point  </i>, and the empress and the GC to be at his side no matter what the galaxy could throw at him.  With that he shut his eyes and drifted off to sleep.

<br />Johnson had been on the command deck when Denson had said that. He barely contained his laughter. Status reports indicated that many systems were in the red, but the Vengeance  held. Fortunately, there had only been minor injuries in the 'skirmish' and the damage wasn't anything that couldn't be repaired within at least a few days. As Chief Engineer, it was his job to make sure that it was all repaired. It was also his job to put armor and restock ammunition.
<br />
<br />The latter part excited him. He would be able to go to Malaga Base, with his kind of people filling every corner. Rogues, Xenos, Junkers, Hesssians, Bundschuh, GC, Blood Dragons, the list goes on and on. He would be able to hear the latest news from the various criminal elements of the sector. He would also be able to get some news from home.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir,&quot; Johnson said respectfully.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, Chief Engineer?&quot; Denson responded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Here is the damage report, fuel levels, ammo levels, and everything else you asked me to get for you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well done, Johnson.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ummm,.... Sir?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;What is it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I was just wondering if I could get leave to go onto Malaga Base; to get needed supplies of course.&quot;
<br />
<br />Denson turned to look at him. He squinted his eyes. &quot;Something tells me that that isn't your only motivation.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;True.... I've been feeling homesick ever since my second imprisonment, and mixing with all those good criminals will make me feel alot better.&quot; Johnson explained.
<br />
<br />&quot;As you'd have it. You have permission to go to Malaga Base.&quot; responded Denson.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot; Johnson turned around and went to the docking bay. As he entered it, his former colleagues immediately stood up and saluted him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Put your damn hands down, you know I hate that.&quot; Johnson walked across the unusually empty docking bay to the Old'n Busted . He opened the gangway and walked in, and strapped himself into the seat. Off he went, to mix with his brethren.
<br />___________________________________________
<br />
<br />&quot;Freelancer Black Nine dash Four, permission to dock granted. Proceed to docking bay four.&quot; said the docking operator.
<br />
<br />As he went in, he marveled at the commotion of the place. The bay had more people and ships in it than he had ever seen in his life. It was amazing.
<br />
<br />Johnson piloted toward a nice dark, corner, where he set his ship. He walked out, and observed the people, looking for a familiar face. He didn't find one.
<br />
<br />So he went off to the bar. Sitting at a table were O'Connor, Lutz, Michael. They waved him over.
<br />
<br />&quot;So what has happened in the land of the living?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;We found Daniel.&quot; said Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;And Terranova.&quot; O'Connor piped in.
<br />
<br />&quot;No way! What would that stuck up brat be doing here? I thought he hated criminals!&quot; Johnson exclaimed. Apparently, hell had frozen over.
<br />
<br />&quot;We don't have a good explanation for that.&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;So anything else?&quot; Johnson had been kept in the dark lately, holed up in the Vengeance  for quite a while.
<br />
<br />&quot;Quigely's coming over with a lot of friends.&quot; said Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;Friends?&quot; asked Johnson.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, Friends. He brought along an admiral, a cruiser, and several gunboats.&quot; said O'Connor.
<br />
<br />Nice, Johnson thought. &quot;So, why are so many criminals here?&quot; asked Johnson.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well,&quot; O'Connor looked at Lutz and Michael. He looked as if it was a strain to even begin speaking. &quot;Many of their bases have been destroyed by Liberty and Rheinland.&quot; he said quickly.
<br />
<br />Oh my God, Johnson thought. &quot;You can't be serious.&quot; Johnson knew that this couldn't be true.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm afraid so.&quot; said O'Connor.
<br />
<br />Johnson still couldn't believe it. &quot;Who - Which ones?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;All of them, inside of Liberty, New Italia, Rheinland, and the Independent Worlds.&quot;
<br />
<br />No, No. Johnson thought. NO.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;
<br />
<br />Shut up SHUT UP! Johnson thought. He looked around. People were staring at him with faces saying 'I know how you feel'. Johnson knew that that was true.
<br />
<br />Johnson stood up, and walked out of the bar. He was going to go to a nice quiet place where he could scream an endless stream of prafanities as loudly as he wanted.
<br />
<br />Edited for accuracy.

			<div class="content">OOC: 13 thingies to anybody whe spots a quote from RvB
<br />
<br />O'Connor: Well lads, I think I'll go <i>Vengeance </i> and see if they need help for upgrading. 
<br />
<br />*Roger walked tworwards the bay trying to reach Denson via comlink, but that didn't seem to word because the amount of transmissions was exessive. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice shouting &quot;Hey, get back here with that! I won it fare and square!&quot;. Roger stopped and looked to he direction of that voice. He couldn't belive his eyes when he saw very good looking man with short dark hair and the guy beside him. Roger walked up to the man mentioned latter and shouted &quot;Look! A a starflyer!&quot; when the man turned around Roger hit him in the face. &quot;I owed you that one&quot; Roger said. &quot;Wohhooo, isn't it the famos 'ghost'&quot; he answered and gazed angrly right into Rogers eyes. This continiued for few moments, then Roger started laughing &quot;Long time no seen huh, Rage?&quot;. Rage was nickname for Rajur Hint - one of the academy's example students, who went on to pirating right after graduation. 
<br />&quot;No sir, academy was the last place we met and that was over 7 years ago.&quot;
<br />&quot;You still got the <i>Aqua Revel </i>?&quot;
<br />&quot;Nope sold it, but I kept your shield 'device'. I never leave home without it. Say don't you know who owns that cruiser over there?&quot; Rajur pointed to a Liberty cruiser moving slowly tworwards the Malaga. Roger was keen to say that its his, but it wasn't I seemed as a standard Liberty cruiser &quot;No, I don't know exactly, but I think its the <i>West Point </i>.&quot; he said. &quot;They ,made a cruiser with the name of a academy? Man they must really have name shortage.&quot; was Rajur suprised. Roger looked around and told Rajur to meet him on the 'other' cruiser that is waiting here. Then he left. Running past Michael and Lutz he told them that <i>West Point </i> is arriving. 
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br />O'Connor: I got the mirrors for the shield. And  Igot a deck of cards for you.
<br />Denson: Good, where did you get them?
<br />O'Connor: I bought them for 16 creds. Everything is so expensive here.
<br />Denson: I meant the mirrors...
<br />O'Connnor: Me too. Anyway what did the HQ say?
<br />Denson: Well, we got the money, but they wanted us to return ASAP.
<br />O'Connnor: Lemme get this straight: We are in the middle of intergalactic war for the survival of mankind and we are told to go on a vacation?
<br />Denson: Yes.
<br />O'Connor: As good as it sounds I think we cannot do that. May said that we gather forces fo next three days here, and we'll move on the fourth. 
<br />Denson: Ok, plan?
<br />O'Connor: We have to get <i>Vengeance </i> 100% operational AND I'd like to achive that in two days, so that everybody get the last day off.
<br />Denson: And the other upgrades?
<br />O'Connor: Well, we might have to build in the airlock for docking the ship with stations like this, then the holographic shield, Those newly invented gatling guns, that electronicaly affected paint...
<br />Denson: What?
<br />O'Connor: You know, the paint that turns into a highly reflecting mirror when shot with electric bolt. Let somebody paint everything even fighters over with it.
<br />Denson: Oh, yea. I knew that one. Heres the ships damage report.
<br />
<br />*After looking through the damage report*
<br />
<br />O'Connor: So we don't build the airlock. 
<br />Denson: Ok, I will take it down in the list.
<br />O'Connor: Remeber the guy who always kicked your ship back in the academy?
<br />Denson: No why?
<br />O'Connor: I just met him, guess he was that good pilot afterall.
<br />Denson: You mean the Rajur?
<br />O'Connor: Yes, I bet you guys were talking about him much in the LibCom.
<br />Denson: You know we did run the whole friggin Liberty navy there, but yes his name came up many times. Too bad he joined the pirates so soon after being kicked out. Now lets drop the subject. Matt responed from Cambridge, he told that Bretonians are already prepearing, but all communications are down with Kursari.
<br />O'Connor: Wonder why...
<br />
<br />*About that moment Harrison jumped in*
<br />
<br />Harrison: We've got the cold emitting device working!
<br />O'Connor: What?
<br />Denson: I got bored back here so I worked out this device to cool down the ships body and combained with that paint of yours that will not let heat through it will saty unlockable for missles and anything else that isn't dumb-fire.
<br />O'Connnor: Good, good. Anything else new?
<br />Denson: The ramming nose from scrap metal is ready. We lost couple of tonns mass, but that will be recovered soon.
<br />Harrison: We also have new security systems inside, turets, lasers, gas launchers all with new autimatic 'friend or foe' identification device. Whole interior is getting reworked.
<br />Denson: And if the goverments haven't invented new engines then we are certanly the fastest cruiser.
<br />O'Connor: What about power to support all this?
<br />Denson: We are building a new powerplant in the cargo bay, with 2 Rheinland battleship powercores and enough battaries to supply us for 17 hours with all systems working.
<br />Harrison: You can't belive how heavy all those battaries and powercores were! we had to make a hole from fighter bay to cargo hold just to put them in place. I bet those guys who built the ship didn't have to do all this.
<br />O'Connnor: Anyways hows our new hull doing?
<br />Denson: The HQ dropped it in new Tokyo.  
<br />O'Connor: Exelent, now if you excuse me I have to go to some briefing. Harrison buy those XR-12 rifles they have here.
<br />
<br />*Roger walked out of the room. Only Denson and Harrison were left to command bridge*
<br />
<br />Denson: How on earth have theese bandits got the lates and greatest sidearms on this base?
<br />Harrison: One of the lifes mysteries. 
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Quigley: ...and about then I passed out.
<br />Michael: Nice story.
<br />O'Connor: Hello, nice to have you back now Quigley. Anybody found where Daniel is?
<br />Quigley: Good to see you too. Whats happed to Daniel?
<br />Lutz: We think Teranova has got him.
<br />Quigley: Like in hostage?
<br />Lutz: No, We think he saved Daniel from Rheinlanders. Ironic huh?
<br />Quigley: Yes, but he still has got the gun... and as long as he has it he is a threat.
<br />Micheal: He also had that scientist. I haven't seen him either.
<br />Lutz: There has been a rumor that Corsairs and Outcasts have actually stoped killing each other for as long a this conflict with Rheinland is threatning them. I have heard poeple even say that they have seen Outcasts here, but no Corsairs.
<br />O'Connor: They might be too busy fighting with Rheinland to came here, or they just don't want to.
<br />Quigley: OR they don't know about this. Somebody might go and tell them about supporting the newly formed pirate resistance.
<br />O'Connor: I think we could find loyal supporters even in New Berlin.
<br />Lutz: Yeah, right and Xenos, Carsairs and Gaians form a joint force against Liberty.
<br />O'Connor: Just a idea...

<br />
<br />Lutz, Michael and O'Connor saw Johnson strole away. They could here him grumbeling to himself. There was no easy way to tell him that most of his friends had probably died in resent attacks by Liberty against all criminal factions.
<br />
<br />O'Connor put down his drink, &quot;I'd better go check up on my ship, they might need my help.&quot;
<br />&quot;Just be sure you're back when briefing starts.&quot; Lutz replied. O'Connor smiled, &quot;Don't worry lads, I'll be back.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael leaned over to Lutz and lowered his voice a bit, so O'Connor wouldn't here him, &quot;He just can't let it go, can he?&quot;
<br />&quot;What, you mean the Vengeance ?&quot; Lutz replied, &quot;Who can blame him, after all, it's practicaly his house. You would do the same.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael had to agree with him on that.
<br />Arrigoni entered the bar and Michael waived him over. Arrigoni saw them and walked over to them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Arrigoni, good to see you. Take a seat.&quot; Michael pulled back the seat wich O&quot;Connor had jammed under the table.
<br />&quot;Thanks.&quot; Said Arrigoni as he said down. &quot;Yeah, good to see you too. Kinda situation we're in right now, aren't we?&quot;
<br />&quot;yeah, somewhere we must have screwed up terribely.&quot;Lutz seemed bittered now he accepted the fact that he wasn't going home very soon.
<br />&quot;Well, at least we're save here.&quot; Michael said, trying to level the mood.
<br />Lutz turned it down again; &quot;Yeah, but for how long?&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael was about to let a hole speech loose on Lutz, about how he had to cheer up and that they were certainly gonna survive through all of this and Lutz would live hapily ever after again with his wife, were it not that at that moment all confersations paused and all heads turned to the door.
<br />A long and elegant Kusari woman entered the bar. She wore a distinctive suit, wich all recognised as a Golden Chrysantimum suit.
<br />Wow, Michael thought, for more then one reason. His first reason was obviously about the beauty of the woman. She walked lightly, as if she hardly touched the floor. She had the style and grace wich could be easily compared to that of a Kusari Empress.
<br />
<br />Arrigoni mumbled, &quot;Wow.&quot;
<br />Lutz Mubled back, &quot;You can say that again.&quot;
<br />Michael was lost for words.
<br />
<br />The mysterious woman looked straight into the bar, without seeming uneasy in the midle of this bar full of strange people, wich was, by the way, almost completely ocupied by men. She let her dark brown eyes glanced over all of them and after having stunned all men in the bar, she turned away and left. Leaving the bar in a complete silence except for the easy listing that came out of the jukebox by the counter.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wow.&quot; Arrigoni repeated, &quot;I think I have just fallen in love.&quot;
<br />&quot;Who was that?&quot; Lutz asked.
<br />Michael pulled him self together again. &quot;I have no idea. But I now realise that more and more people are getting involved in this.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes. I've seen a lot of diferent people here.&quot; Lutz replied. &quot;Most are Raiders, Lane Hackers and Hessians. But I've seen a few Rogues, Unioners and even some Arrigosha.&quot;
<br />
<br />Arrigoni had also gained full senses again. &quot;I've even seen some Outcasts around. They're probably here to back up the Rogues, Hackers and GC.&quot;
<br />&quot;This Freddy May character sure has his stuff organised well, Michael.&quot; Said Lutz, &quot;I gotta hand him that.&quot;
<br />Michael: I told ya so.
<br />
<br />At that moment a few guys, who had been sitting at a table on the other side of the bar, jumped up and headed quickly to the docking bay.
<br />They could overhear a part of their conversation and could make up that the West Point  had arived. That meant that Quigley had arived. And very soon they could see paramedics walking a strecher from the docking bay into the lift probably towards the medicalfacilities.
<br />
<br />&quot;Did you see that? Michael called out excited, &quot;That must be Quigley, lets go and see how he does.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael got up from his chair, followed by Lutz and Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lets hope he's not hurt too serious,&quot; said Lutz, &quot;He's a fine pilot, we could certainly use him.&quot;
<br />
<br />They made their way to the lift and went to deck eleven.
<br />When they got out, Michael held up a doctor.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey doc, van you tell us where you brought the man who was just taken in from the West Point ?&quot;
<br />&quot;In room five, but be gentle. He is awake but very weak. Not more then five minutes, ok?&quot;
<br />
<br />Five minutes seemed fair and the gang ran of to room five.
<br />The door was closed and Michael knocked. A pretty face opened the door. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, how can I help you?&quot; said the pretty face.
<br />&quot;Oh, excuse me, but we'd like to see how Quigley's doing.&quot; 
<br />
<br />She seemed reluctant.
<br />
<br />&quot;If it's allright with you, ofcourse.&quot; Lutz added quickly.
<br />
<br />she looked over her shoulder and Michael could get a glimpse of the battered Captain. he mumbled something to her and she opened the door.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, Matty says it's allright, come in.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Matty?&quot; Michael, Lutz and Arrigoni looked at each other for a moment and had to bite their tongues in order not to laugh.
<br />
<br />They walked into the room and found themselfs in a wel lit room, with lots of equipment bleeping and flashing, to watch over Quigley.
<br />
<br />Michael gently punched him in the shoulder and imediatly received an evil look from the woman. &quot;So, how are we doing today, old mate?&quot;
<br />&quot;Carefull with the shoulder Michael, I'm not as tough as I used to be. Not yet anyway.&quot; Quigley laughed but his smile streched to an awfull grin as he grabbed around his chest to support it.
<br />
<br />The woman rushed towards Quigley, almost throwing Arrigoni and Lutz, who were standing on the other side of the bed, against the wall.
<br />
<br />&quot;Easy Matt, your ribs are bruised and the doctor said you should keep quiet.&quot;
<br />&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know.&quot; Quigley replied, acting a bit anoyed, but Michael and the others could see they were obviously more than just friends.
<br />&quot;Let me introduce you to a good friend of mine.&quot; Quigley said, while holding the hand of the woman for a second or two.
<br />&quot;This is Rachel, one of Liberties finest. I mean, well, you get the point.&quot;
<br />
<br />They all shook hands and introduced themselfs to Rachel.
<br />
<br />&quot;We flew a few missions before I was, ehm, forced to leave the Navy. It was just by chance I ran into her again on West Point Academy. Fresh of the Lt. training, she's proven her rank far above expectations. Ofcourse, I already knew how good she was.&quot; Quigley looked at Rachel, who looked back at him.
<br />&quot;Can I trust you to take it easy while I'm gone?&quot; she asked him.
<br />&quot;Where are you going then?&quot; Quigley asked.
<br />&quot;To the litle girls room, silly. I will be right back.&quot; She got up and left the room.
<br />&quot;Wow Quigley, you got her wraped around your finger man.&quot; Arrigoni said, when he was sure she was out of hearing range.
<br />&quot;Nah,&quot; Said Lutz, &quot;it's the other way around, isn't it, Matty.&quot; They all laughed and Quigley grasped his chest again. He moaned.
<br />&quot;I wouldn't go so far as to say we're involved. We're very good friends, nothing more.&quot;
<br />&quot;whatever Matt,&quot; Michael replied smiling. &quot;So tell me, what happened?&quot;
<br />&quot;Well...&quot;
<br />
<br />Quigley told them in short about the asignment in Hudson, the surviving criminals led by Jezebel, the detreyal by one of his men, the fight against Liberty cruisers and the Valks and finaly the rescue by Admiral Evans and his cruiser West point .
<br />
<br />&quot;Quite a story there Matt...&quot; Michael was going to finish that sentence, but was interupted by O'Connor.
<br />&quot;Quigley, good to see you're alright lad.&quot; O'Connor tried to shake his hand, but quigley was still weak, so it was more a squeeze rather than a shake.
<br />&quot;Glad to be back O'Connor.&quot; Said Quigley.
<br />
<br />At that moment May's voice came up on the intercomm.
<br />
<br />&quot;Allright everybody, it's about that time again, when we evaluate our enlightfull situation. Every men and woman able to stand longer than five minutes should get his butt over to the bar, where I will brief you all. May out.&quot;
<br />
<br />A short moment of static noise and the comm went dead.
<br />
<br />&quot;You better get going.&quot; Quigley said and they all left the room.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm very curious about what he has to say.&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;We all are Lutz, we all are.&quot; said Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />They entered the bar, wich was filled with a lot of people from diferent factions.
<br />
<br />&quot;This looks like a damn anual trade convention.&quot; said Michael, &quot;But then for a diferent kind of coorparation.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Look over there!&quot; Arrigoni pointed to the far end of the room. in the corner stood Terranova. They could see he was anoyed by the fact he was not in control anymore. But he gave up his control when he came to Malaga.
<br />
<br />&quot;Where is Daniel I can't see him.&quot; O'Connor streched his body to look over the crowd.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm here.&quot; O'Connor leaped in the air as Daniel apeared behind him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't sneak up on me, christ, you scared the hell out of me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sorry.&quot; Daniel excused. &quot;So, how are you guys?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Fine. we were looking for you.&quot; said Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I lost track of you guys.&quot; Said Daniel. He sounded a bit judgemental.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, we're sorry. Things got a little hectic as you probably have noticed.&quot; replied Arrigoni. &quot;Whats the deal with the Terra dude?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Dunno, he showed up and saved my but from a wing of Valks advanced. If it wasn't for him, I'd be dead by now. Gueass I was lucky huh?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It's what you call luck.&quot; mumbled Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />Daniel wanted to ask him what he said, but Frederick May entered the bar. He climbed up on a table, so everyone could see him and started to speak.
<br />
<br />&quot;Friends, fellow warriors and loyal followers, the last few days have been rather unpleasant to say the least and I wanted to take a moment to remember those who we lost in the cowerdly attacks inflicted uppon us by Rheinland and those Liberty traitors.&quot; 
<br />
<br />He paused briefly and bowed his head as a gesture to the fallen ones. here and there you could here a one or two people start to cry. The memories were very fresh. May continued.
<br />
<br />&quot;it's sad that only in these times of desperation, we find who our true allies are. But I would like to welcome every single one of you to Malaga and I'm sure that even under these circumstances we together can find our way out of this mess.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael noticed that May started to sound rediculously like a diplomat and couldn't help but smile a litle, because he knew May despised all diplomats and other kinds of political trash, as he often used to refer to them. Lutz saw Michaels smile and realising the serious situation he kicked his leg. Michael looked at Lutz and got the hint.
<br />
<br />&quot;I also want to welcome the Kusari Empress, who has promised aid and support in every way possible. And we are glad to return the favour anytime ma'am.&quot; He bowed down as far as his stiff back would let him and actually needed a hand in getting up again.
<br />
<br />&quot;I also would like to welcome Miss Malystryx on behalf of the Golden Chrysantimums, Aku Oshori on behalf of the Blood Dragons and Ravi Gomez on behalf of the Outcasts. About the current situation I can be short. Rheinland has Italy completely overpowered and the New Italian Congress had absolutely no other choice than to surrender without a fight. The Rheinland force in it's current form would have wiped out the Italian forces completely within a day or two. And about fifteen minutes ago we recieved wordt from our Bretonian alies that Liberty has pushed it's forces into Magalan and Cortez, Wich puts Liberty right at the Bretonian frontdoor. If intel is right, they should be able to move into Manchester within two days.&quot;
<br />
<br />He paused to take a zip of water and continued.
<br />
<br />&quot;Rheinland is currently moving it's forces into Sigma 13 aswell as Kepler and Galileo. We can be sure they pay a quick visit to this system, so we need to move within the next two days. Mister Oshori asured us we could use the facilities at Kyoto base.&quot; May looked quickly at Aku for a confermation, wich he got and he continued. &quot;We will dicide further steps as we get there. The Outcasts have prommised us complete backup with suplies and, should the situation acuire it, nesesary forces.&quot; Again he searched conformation and again he received it. &quot;The set time for exodus is T minus 45 hours. To everyone with a ship I say, try to get yours ready and upgrade it if possible. Next briefing will be at 10 o'clock Manhattan standart time. Dismissed everyone.&quot; 
<br />
<br />May descended from his iprovised mount and as soon as he left the room everyone started to walk to the landingbay, wich was afcourse, totaly crowded in a matter of minutes. Lutz, Arrigoni and Michael stayed and watched as the crowed moved towards the landing bay.
<br />
<br />&quot;We don't want to be there right now.&quot; said Michael. And he was right. It was probably best not to be between a bunch of emotional criminals.
<br />
<br /><b>Lutz turned to Michael, &quot;So this is what you didn't want to tell me?&quot; Lutz looked Michael directly in the eye, annoyed that his friend hadn't trust him.
<br />
<br />Michael looked ashamed. &quot;I couldn't Lutz...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why not?&quot; Lutz's anger grew stronger.
<br />
<br />&quot;You wouldn't have beleved me.&quot; said Michael in an attempt to justify his lack of confidence.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damnit Michael! we flew throught the toughest battles together, I saved your ass more then once and you did it for me, the least you could do is trust me!&quot;
<br />
<br />With that outburst of Lutz, the people who were still in the bar, stopped and watched the arguement.
<br />
<br />&quot;What did you want me to do Lutz? They asked me not to tell anyone. And even IF I had told you, would you beleve that Liberty was betraing it's own inhabitants, ruthlessly killing all who stood up against the new militaristic regime. Would you have beleved me if I told you that the gouvernement wich you trust to protect your wife has defected? And what would you have done if I told you, would it have made things any different?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes Michael. It damn well would. We would have been in this thing together. We could've been there for eachother, cause that's what friends do!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhm, guys,&quot; said Arrigoni carefully, &quot;we got company.&quot;
<br />
<br />He pointed to the doors of the bar and they could see May walking up to them.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, is everything allright here?&quot; May asked, unknowingly of the heated argument just a few seconds before.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're allright,&quot; said Lutz, &quot;we were just going over the briefing.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good.&quot; said May and he turned to Michael. &quot;Michael,I need you to do a job for me. Meet me on the bridge in ten minutes and take your escort with you.&quot; Without waiting for an answer, May quickly turned around on his heals and headed for the bridge.
<br />
<br />&quot;I wonder what that was all about.&quot; said Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, me too actually.&quot; Michael looked at Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhm, I'm sorry about all this. I realise I should have told you. If you don't want to come with me I understand.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael waited as Lutz was pondering on the verdict.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's allright Michael. I understand the dificult situation you were in.&quot; said Lutz, &quot;I'm with you on this one. It might even give me a chance to...&quot; He hesitated.
<br />
<br />&quot;To what?&quot; asked Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />&quot;To get back at those bastards.&quot; replied Lutz and they seemed to setle for that.
<br />
<br />If he told everybody here what he had in mind, they would never let him go. He would tell them later.
<br />
<br />&quot;Arrigoni?&quot; Michael looked at his other friend.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, that's what I'm here for. I just need to get me another ship, cause my Camel ain't gonna do much good outthere I bet. I saw a few Stilletoes back in the landing bay, I'm sure the bosss will let me have one of those beauties.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, lets do this.&quot; said Michael as he lead the way to the bridge where they were welcomed by May. </b>
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />&quot;Good, I knew you wouldn't get yourself involved with the scary kind.&quot; he obviously meant Lutz and Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lets get to business, because time is not on our side.&quot; May called up a map of New York on the main screen.
<br />&quot;We have recieved word of some minor resistance in Liberty. This minor resistance has somehow managed to rescue the president and is currently ocupying LPI Sugarland. But they are weakening and need to be extracted as soon as posible. The resistance consists mostly of criminals, and a few Police and Navy defectants who were locked up in there.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So we're basicaly going straight into the Lions den, aren't we?&quot; Lutz asked, he was getting a bit nervous. He had his share of experiance with an angry Liberty force against him. He wouldn't be happy to go through all of that again. But on the other hand, He might be able to get his beloved wife out of there.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm afraid that's what it is. But Liberty has most of it's attention focused on Magalan and Cortez, so Getting in shouldn't be to dificult and if all goes well, you should be able to get out of there just as quickly. Well, what do you say?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Count me in, May.&quot; said Michael eagerly, although he had a funny fealing about it. But he knew how importand the President was and he also knew that this was the best and posibaly the only chance they would ever get.
<br />
<br />&quot;Great, I knew you wouldn't let me down Michael. How about you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You bet.&quot; Lutz said it firmly. It seemed as though he was already concentrated on his task.
<br />
<br />Arrigoni had only one condition, but he got the Stiletto right away.
<br />
<br />&quot;Very well, You will leave in thirty minutes. An escort will take you through the newly discouvered Franfurt jumphole and to the Bering jumphole. (OOC: lets just pretend it has always been there <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) From there on you will be on your own, but Bering will be almost empty and the trip to Texas Should be easy. Any questions? Very well. Get ready for launch. I have prepared dock two for you, so it will be empty. Dismissed.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael walked to dock Two, wondering what he had got himself and his friends, into.

			<div class="content">OOC:another chance to move along Quigley and get him back into the storyline.  Also I took the liberty of moving Jezebel a bit too.
<br />
<br />Quigley was so bored.  His friends had left to go the May&#8217;s briefing.  Rachel had peeked in and mentioned that she was needed at the briefing and ran off.  That left him all alone in one of Malaga Base&#8217;s medical rooms.  There had been an influx of wounded from the <i>West Point </i>.  Luckily, Quigley was one of the best off, but he still has exhausted and the doctors had discovered he&#8217;d bruised his ribs with some of the high G turns he&#8217;d been doing.
<br />
<br />He was so bored.  He sung songs in his head which did nothing but get a Kusari techno song stuck in his head.  He&#8217;d thought about the <i>Cerulean Dream </i>.  He&#8217;d heard it was still in pieces.  Quigley had the <i>Valhalla Maiden </i>, the captured Valkyrie with the Avarice guns.  He liked the <i>Dream </i>, but the <i>Maiden </i> gave him the firepower he needed in the coming fight.  While Quigley vexed over his ship loyalties, he was interrupted by Jimmy, his gearhead subordinate.  &#8220;Hey, Matty, mind if I come in?&#8221;  Jimmy said with a mischievous grin.
<br />
<br />Quigley rolled his eyes.  &#8220;Sure, Jimmy.  What brings you around here?  I figured the pirates and other residents of this base would be peeling you away from their fighters by now.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Already did that.  Most of them are pretty blah.  Some are pretty interesting.  Like that Lutz guy&#8217;s modded Defender, that&#8217;s incredible or Terraneuvo&#8217;s ship, man, it looks like he pieced that thing together with scrap metal and space tape.&#8221;  Jimmy&#8217;s eye lit up as he described the weird new ships and technology he&#8217;d seen.  &#8220;I almost forgot.  There&#8217;s this new GC woman with a kick ass Dragon.  You should see it!  And her, wow.  Gorgeous is the only word, and tall, man she was tall.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley chuckled, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to meet her, but I wouldn&#8217;t let Jezebel hear you say those things.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jimmy looked confused, &#8220;Why would she care?  We&#8217;re not going out or anything.  I&#8217;ve just been helping her fix her ship.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley grinned, <i>Wow, he has no idea.  I&#8217;d better keep quiet until he finds out for himself. </i>  &#8220;Speaking of ships, how&#8217;s your ship coming along?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jimmy looked down a little, &#8220;They scrapped it for parts.  It was bad enough that it would have taken too much to get it flying.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;So you&#8217;re shipless, eh?  Well, Jimmy, I&#8217;ll tell you what.  You are about to do me a favor.  I&#8217;ve got a ownerless ship that you would love.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The young man&#8217;s face lit up.  &#8220;What ship?  Where?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;My old ship, the <i>Cerulean Dream </i>.  Don&#8217;t get too excited.  It&#8217;s in pieces still from a run in with Rhienland techs.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, that&#8217;s even better!  I can rebuild it better than before.  I mean this is the ship with Sunblast B&#8217;s and a jury rigged torp launcher, correct?  Man, the things I can do with that!&#8221; Jimmy was nearly jumping up and down with excitement.
<br />
<br />&#8220;On top of that, you get to go out to the <i>Vengeance </i>.  That ship has been modded like you wouldn&#8217;t believe.  There&#8217;s also a man on board by the name of Danson who I think you&#8217;d just click with.&#8221; Now, Jimmy was squirming to leave the room and catch the next ship going to the <i>Vengeance </i>, so he could see his new ship and Danson.  &#8220;And there&#8217;s just one thing you have to do for me.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jimmy stopped, his eyebrows furrowed.  &#8220;Not change the paint job?&#8221;  Quigley shook his head.  &#8220;Not change the name?&#8221;  Quigley shook his head.  &#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Never call me Matty.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jimmy smiled.  &#8220;Okay, Matthew.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Or that.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jimmy tilted his head to the side.  &#8220;But that&#8217;s what Rachel and the Admiral call you.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s my first name, but I&#8217;ve never really liked it.  I let the Admiral call me that because he&#8217;s the Admiral; he does what he wants.  I&#8217;ve told Rachel, but she thinks it&#8217;s cute.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jimmy smiled and ran out the door to claim his new &#8220;toy.&#8221;  Quigley sighed and stared back up at the ceiling.  He was alone again and bored almost instantly.  He&#8217;d meant to ask Jimmy what had been going on, but the scrawny kid&#8217;s enthusiasm had side tracked him.  Quigley was so bored that he began counting the rivets in the ceiling.  He lost count when there was a soft knock at the door.
<br />
<br />Quigley looked past his feet to see a young Kusari woman standing the doorway.  She was wearing the armored flight uniform of the Golden Chrysanthemums.  She was beautiful but not tall as Jimmy had described the &#8220;Wonder&#8221; woman.  But height comparisons from the short and scrawny Jimmy were unreliable.  The woman looked at him but didn&#8217;t speak.  &#8220;Um&#8230; yes?&#8221; Quigley said with an expecting tone.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Is this a good time, Quigley-san?&#8221; the young lady asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;A good a time as any.  What can I do for you?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Not anything for me.  The empress wants to know if this is a convenient time for her to visit since you are unable to.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;This would be a fine time.  You may tell her majesty that she may come anytime she wishes.&#8221;  Quigley thought that was a little formally.  The empress could have just sent a message.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh good, she is waiting outside.  May I present Empress Shuzaya, ruler of all Kusari.&#8221; The GC woman stepped aside and bowed.  From behind her, came a young girl of maybe fifteen.  Quigley knew better than to be fooled by her age.  He had met the empress back in his days at Anui Depot before its destruction.  She was the most regal person he&#8217;d ever met.  Quigley has always thought that capital ship captains were regal like kings, but they were peasants compared to the real thing.  Empress Shuzaya was also deceptively intelligent.  She had grown up in the GC and was constantly being taught.  She knew history, martial arts, marksmanship, flying, cultures, etiquette, and nearly every language in Sirius.  She was also a good strategist from her education of history and Sun Tzu&#8217;s the <i>Art of War </i>.
<br />
<br />Quigley bowed his head, which is as much as he could bend.  The empress stepped forward to the foot of his bed.  She also wore the GC&#8217;s armored uniform, but this was a change because she used to wear the ceremonial robes of Kusari royalty.  Quigley motioned over to the chair beside his bed.  The empress smiled and sat in the chair.  She looked him over and looked a little sad at his worn-out form and fitful breathing because of his bruised ribs.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My dear samurai, you were always so valiant and willing to sacrifice your self to do what is right and that which no other can.&#8221;  The empress said in perfect Libertonian and regal tones.
<br />
<br />&#8220;My privilege, my curse, your Majesty.  I seem to get the stuffing beat out of me every time I do.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The empress smiled sweetly, &#8220;Yes, I have heard the story.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You have?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Oh, yes.  It is very popular on this base.  Everyone is talking about the pilot who took out four Valkyrie Advances on his own.  Your revenge against your betrayer is more intriguing.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You mean Penn?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes, David Penn.  A foolish man would forget his own trap and let it backfire on him.  That victory was a victory of superior intellect.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley smiled, &#8220;Thank you.  I am honored to be in your presence again.&#8221;
<br />
<br />This time it was the empress&#8217; turn to smile.  &#8220;The Chrysanthemums have never forgotten you, Quigley.  When you left, many felt our movement had lost a valuable champion. The pain of Nazomi&#8217;s absence is still present in all our hearts.  She would have been a great ally in this present fight.&#8221;  The empress bowed her head in memory of her lost friend.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Matty, I&#8217;m back from&#8230;&#8221; Rachel bounced into the room but stopped when she saw the Kusari women.  &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.  I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt anything.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, Rachel.  I&#8217;d actually like you to meet someone.&#8221;  Quigley turned to empress Shuzaya.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Quigley, I know who she is.  I&#8217;m honored to meet you, Empress.&#8221;  Rachel bowed stiffly.  The empress smiled at Rachel&#8217;s attempt to honor her in her custom.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a half of the introduction.  Your Majesty, this is Lieutenant Rachel Lyta.  She is my second in command and wingmate.  She&#8217;s as good as or better than any pilot here.&#8221; Quigley said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;It is a pleasure to meet a friend of Quigley&#8217;s.&#8221; The empress said with a smile.  Rachel returned the smile and nodded thanks.  Rachel moved to Quigley&#8217;s side and placed a hand on his shoulder.  Quigley looked up at her and smiled and then returned his attention to the empress.  &#8220;So Quigley will accept Mr. May&#8217;s invitation?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m all for it, but I can&#8217;t speak for my friends.  Anyways I haven&#8217;t even heard what was going on.&#8221;
<br />
<br />The empress related May&#8217;s speech to Quigley.  The Rheinland&#8217;s move into adjacent areas was disturbing.  That news was not as bad Liberty&#8217;s sudden megalomania and move into Cortez and Magellan.  &#8220;The Kusari government is capitulating to the Rheinlanders.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Whoa, that&#8217;s serious.  Has May been informed?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I just found out myself.  One of my lieutenants, Malystryx, just arrived and told me the news.  She arrived just as Mr. May&#8217;s briefing began.  She told Mr. May and myself after the briefing.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Hmm&#8230;Malystryx.  I don&#8217;t remember her.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;A lot has happened in two years.  Malystryx came to us in unusual circumstances, but she is a loyal and able member of our movement.  She has gained the respect of many people.&#8221;  The empress smiled impishly.  &#8220;And many men for that matter.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Thoughts clicked in Quigley&#8217;s brain, and he made connection.  &#8220;Oh, I have heard about this Malystryx in a way.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;You mean the young boy, Miko and I saw run out of your room.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;That was James Yarlbough, another of my pilots.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Rachel looked down at Quigley.  &#8220;Jimmy was here?  Really, the doctor said a few visitors.  Sound like the whole station&#8217;s been down here.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Empress Shuzaya got up, &#8220;I realize that I must let you rest.  I have obligations that I must fulfill.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Empress, you do not have to go.&#8221; Rachel said sheepishly, feeling she had just run off royalty.
<br />
<br />&#8220;No, Miss Lyta, I must let Quigley rest.  As I am Empress, I know that he will need it, and we will need him.&#8221;  The empress got up and walked to the door.  Miko, the empress&#8217;s handmaiden, followed dutifully behind her mistress.  &#8220;Quigley-san, one more thing.&#8221;  The empress turned back to the couple in the room.  &#8220;I know Nazomi would be proud of your progress, your actions, and you choice.&#8221;  With the last two words, the young empress looked Rachel in her green eyes and left.
<br />
<br />Rachel looked down into Quigley&#8217;s blue eyes, confused.  &#8220;What was that about?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Quigley smiled and got more comfortable in the bed.  &#8220;Just some kind words about an old friend and a new one.&#8221;
<br />
<br />
<br />Jezebel wandered the halls of Malaga Base alone.  The <i>West Point </i> group had scattered upon reaching the base.  Quigley was in the med wing with Rachel glued to his arm.  Wolfie had wandered off to see if he knew anyone here from his old days on the Manhattan streets.  The Admiral had gone to talk to Frederick May about adding the <i>West Point </i> to the coalition fleet.  She had hung around Jimmy but lost track of him as he crawled over ships in the crowded landing bay.
<br />
<br />Jezebel clutched her arms around her closely.  She hated being alone right now.  Her friends were so busy and that left her all alone.  Even the crowded station did nothing to help her.  There were no Xenos here.  And anyone from the other groups just reminded her failure to save the Survivors.  Her sadness and depression were setting in on her again.  All she wanted now was a place to sulk and cry.
<br />
<br />Jezebel walked into a secluded cargo bay but found it wasn&#8217;t quite as secluded as she wished.  A young man was raging across the room.  He was cursing a vile streak and striking out at the piled cargo.  Jezebel felt she just leave him alone, but her curiosity overwhelmed her.  &#8220;Um&#8230;are you okay?&#8221;
<br />
<br />The young man looked up mid-kick at a container of uniforms.  &#8220;I&#8217;d kinda like to be alone.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I was trying to do the same thing, but I&#8217;m not getting too much luck on such a crowded station.&#8221;  Jezebel moved closer, but the man twirled away.  &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to sit here.  You can go about your screaming and cursing.&#8221;  Jezebel sat on a low container and put her head in her hands, thinking about her situation in life.
<br />
<br />The man had turned back to the mystery woman who had interrupted his fit.  &#8220;Who you?&#8221; the man asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m Jezebel.  I just came in on the <i>West Point </i> with Matthew Quigley.&#8221;  She looked up to answer the man
<br />
<br />&#8220;Quigley&#8217;s quite the hero.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;He deserves it.  He saved my and my friend&#8217;s lives.  We were about to end up like everyone else in Bering, dead.&#8221;  Jezebel looked down into her hands again.  The man rushed over to her and grabbed her shoulders.  Jezebel pushed him away and got up.  &#8220;Who do you think you are, buddy?&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m Thomas Johnson.  Were you a Rogue at Dawson?&#8221;
<br />
<br />Jezebel sneered a little at the idea.  &#8220;No, I was a Xeno.  But I was made default leader of the pirates leftover in the system.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Johnson&#8217;s hopes soared.  Jezebel might know what happened to Valerie!

			<div class="content">OOC: As a general request, malstryx, could you please write in proper English? Correct capitalization and punctuation would be a great boon for all of us. (No offense intended by this.) Sure, the people that you write about don't have to talk in perfect English, but It would be nice to have punctuation for understanding better.
<br />OOC2: I wrote this big ol' huge post about Johnson's little seclusion, and then jedierrant comes and makes a post that brings me into it just as I am writing it! I can adapt though. Makes the story more interesting.
<br />
<br />Johnson was very excited about this. He flet guilty at the excitement over finding his love rather than sadness at the destruction of everybody else, but he didn't care right now. &quot;Did you, ummm, know a person named Valerie Jackson? Was she there with you when you were leader of the survivors?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Valerie Jackson. Humm.&quot; Jezebel thought it over for a moment. &quot;I think I might remember reading that name on a list of some sort.&quot; Johnson got exctited.
<br />
<br />&quot;Go on, go on.&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Was she a really pretty blonde? Blue eyes? Tall? Thin?&quot; Jezebel asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's the perfect description of her.&quot; Johnson said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I think I remember her. She left soon after everyone was gathered on Atka. She said that she hated her situation and was going to look for a better life. I don't know what happened to her after that. Sorry.&quot; Jezebel sensed Johnson's thorough dissapointment.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nah, don't get all worked up over it. Let's keep in touch, Okay? I haven't heard anything from my corner of the galaxy except for the fact that it's been destroyed. Other than that, nothing. I'd like to know what happened.&quot; Johnson turned around going the direction he was going. He turned around. &quot;I don't have anything against Xenos. You're all okay with me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jezebel felt slightly better. Johnson walked off after that.
<br />_____________________________________
<br />Johnson sat alone with his face burried in his hands. It was now time to think about what had happened, and give proper dues to the dead.
<br />
<br />Johnson found quite possibly the most remote corner in all the base, and had sat there, back to the wall, crying all the way. There were several scorch marks on the wall from where he got so mad that he decided to fire on the station. It didn't give him the necessary satisfaction he required.
<br />
<br />Johnson continued to grumble to himself, cursing his misfortune. Slaughtered like animals, he thought. No respect for human life, he thought. If he could take on the whole of the universe with his bare hands and rip it apart, he absolutley knew he would.
<br />
<br />He sat there several hours, thinking of all the good times he had, the friends that would be dead. The love that he had lost. Several times he had thought of suicide, but he convinced himself that that wasn't the way. The floor was very wet with tears that kept resurfacing.
<br />
<br />He wasn't sure whether he wanted someone to talk to or not. But someone came. Heh, he thought. I guess this isn't the most remote corner of the base.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, man. Who are you?&quot; the man said.
<br />
<br />&quot;A guy who lost all his everything.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Dude, I'm sorry. I'll just go now and leave you alone.&quot; the guy responded.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, no. Misery loves company.&quot; His eyes were watering up.
<br />
<br />&quot;Umm...., So what's your name?&quot; he asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thomas Johnson.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You a criminal?&quot; he asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Depends on your point of view. I'm still a Rogue to me, but I work on a renegade Liberty cruiser.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Which one?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The <i>Vengeance </i>.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn, you've got a job on the best ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />Johnson chuckled. He still felt sad. This conversation helped though. &quot;So what's your name, job, and station?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm a Rogue too. My name is Paul Fitzgerald.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's a mouthful of a name.&quot; For some reason, he thought he hated that name. &quot;Did you live on Dawson?&quot; Johnson was curious. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah. Why?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Your name seems pretty familiar.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yours does too.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Did we hate eachother?&quot; Johnson asked. It helped him to get his mind off all the destruction and death. He knew he would have to face it in full later, but this helped.
<br />
<br />&quot;I think we did.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What was it over?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I think we liked the same girl.&quot; Ohhh, Johnson thought. I know who this guy is.
<br />
<br />&quot;We got in many a fight over it.&quot; Johnson said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I remember now.&quot; Paul said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you know what happened to her?&quot; Johnson asked. He had a little hope.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sorry, man, I don't.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn.&quot; Johnson's little glimmer of hope faded. Memories pored back. He could hold back the crying now. &quot;So what are you doing here?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Coming to this place. I had my time for a big emotional outburst. I'm still depressed. I need a place to think by myself. So I found this place.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I see I'm not alone.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah....&quot;
<br />
<br />Silence. Very long silence. They thought for a very long time.
<br />
<br />&quot;I think I'm in good enough shape to go back to my job.&quot; Johnson stood up and made motions to the seemingly endless corridor.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, see you around.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You never told me what your job was.&quot; Johnson said as he was leaving.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm a cardamine smuggler.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This big war thing hasn't phased ya?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nope.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good to see a brave soul around here.&quot; Johnson said. Johnson left.
<br />___________________________________________________________
<br />Johnson went to the bar. He met Lutz along the way.
<br />
<br />&quot;You okay, Johnson?&quot; Lutz asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;A little better. Doing anything that might get me proper revenge?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well,...&quot;
<br />
<br />Lutz explained that the head honcho guy of this base had asked Michael and others to raid LPI Sugarland and free the prisoners.
<br />
<br />&quot;You have to let me go.&quot; Johnson said. He would get in real combat. Heavy combat. Combat like unto no combat he had fought in before. His blood began pumping. &quot;You really have to let me go.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't see, why not, but don't you have a job on the <i>Vengeance </i>?&quot; Lutz asked.
<br />
<br />Oh yeah, he thought. &quot;I don't care about that anymore. Denson can handle that job well enough by his lonesome.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;If you say so.... We're going to be leaving shortly. If you can get a competent fighting vessel within that time, I guess you can go.&quot; Lutz responded.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I'm off to go find one. See you in space.&quot; said Johnson. He soon left. First place was the docking bay. One, Two, Three, Four; he checked them all, asking various people for an available ship. He found a suitable Wolfhound in the bay four. It was an abandoned ship that had been refitted. And the pirates were giving them away like candy because God knows they needed pilots. Johnson would have to pay alot later, but he needed a ship now. It wasn't the best one available, it wasn't the fastest, the most armored, the most armed, or anything else. But it would do. &quot;I'll take it,&quot; he told the dealer.</div>

			<div class="content">&quot;<i>Chukuso  </i>!&quot; Daniel muttered under his breath. The surprise of seeing his starboard fin just <i>drop  </i> off of the Seer  preceded the surprise of hearing himself utter a word he had never known he knew. It's these damn Golden Chrysanthemums,  he thought. <i>Rogues and Hackers and Junkers and all them look similar enough, but every time I see a GC I'm reminded of my father's heratige. </i>
<br />Not that he had a problem with being reminded of half his past, it was Daniel didn't like being reminded of it by those cardamine-users.
<br />He turned back to the <i>Seer.  </i> His Dragon was in shambles after the engagement with the Rheinland fleet. He had to find a replacement Port fin somewhere. And now he would have to weld the other fin back on. The Kusari's signature fins were very pretty, but incredibly frail. This was the seventh time that Daniel had to fix them.
<br />
<br />At least one good thing had come out from the tangle with those Valks - he salvaged an advanced debilitator from the disabled Valkyrie. Daniel glanced up at it. It had taken a bit of rigging to set up the overclassed pulse weapon, but it looked like it would be worth it. Not quite an ion cannon, but close enough. Sure, the power drain would add up in the heat of battle, but he could always get his neuralnet to shut off the pulse gun when against shield-less opponents.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, hey! Daniel!&quot; It was Lutz. Micheal was close behind. &quot;Well, I kinda feel guilty about leaving you behind back there in the Italian sector.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, It's okay. I'm not exactly that hard to forget about. Where's Arrigoni?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;He's off picking up a Stiletto for-&quot; Micheal cut himself short. Then after a small hesitation, he continued. &quot;May's sending us off on a secret mission to liberate some loyalists from places like Sugarland, and, uh...&quot; he looked at Lutz, and an unspoken message went between the two.
<br />
<br />&quot;I see. Of course, I'd like to come but as you can see,&quot; Daniel gestured to his broken-down Dragon, &quot;I'm in no condition to go anywhere.&quot; And borrowing was out of the question, he thought, after that incident in that piece-of-cow Valkyrie.
<br />
<br />&quot;Speaking of that, what happened out there in New Rome?&quot; Micheal asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I got to the planet and finding you not there I looked into the nearest tradelane. It turned out we must have passed in the tradelane, so I headed back. But at Vatican station, this Rheinland fleet popped up out of nowhere and tried to arrest me. So I, uh, 'fled the scene' as it were.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What about the torn-up turrets on that cruiser?&quot; Lutz inquired.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ahh, well,&quot; Daniel grinned guiltily. &quot;I dropped a couple mines so they wouldn't shoot a stormblade at me... plus that open fighter bay door was just too tempting. Heh heh.
<br />&quot;So, anyway, I cruised away from there, using Vatican for cover. I couldn't make the asteroid field in time, so I engaged. I managed to disable one before they overpowered me. That's when Terranova came in and saved my life.&quot;
<br />
<br />Terranova... That was a strange meeting. He came in and fried two of the Valks before the remaining turned tail and ran. He barely said anything, which was different from what Daniel remembered about Terranova. He would have either been all gloating for saving Psawhn's life, or being extremely mad for having being bothered to save Psawhn's life. With either option Terranova would have been extremely chatty, but that was not the case. He hardly said anything except for &quot;Be more careful next time.&quot;
<br />
<br />Daniel continued with the story. &quot;I didn't know if he was gonna kill me or not. He just sat there for a long time. Then he seemed to make up his mind and said 'Follow me.' I'd have been a fool to refuse. Of course, I also took the chance and nabbed one of those Valk's debilitators.
<br />&quot;We barely got anywhere when a group of Raiders popped out of the asteroid field. Terranova almost shot them but they pleaded no. That's when I learned that New Italy was taken over by the Rheinland forces. Terranova replied 'Yeah? And what do you care, you scum?' So Terranova knew it already, and that was probably why he was so quiet. He must have been mad beyond anything we've ever seen him before, and I was scared.
<br />&quot;At any rate, the Raiders told us about this base, and how almost all the criminals are forming up a resistance group. So that's my story.&quot;
<br />
<br />Arrigoni must have slipped in somewhere during Daniel's story, for he now said &quot;Lutz, Micheal? We're prepping for launch in a few minutes.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You guys go on,&quot; Daniel said. &quot;I'll hear from you when we meet up again.&quot;
<br />The group left after saying their good-byes.
<br />
<br />Daniel then noticed a scrawny man in a flight suit jumping around the maintenace bay, in apparant ecstacy. It was obviously one of the people from the <i>West Point  </i>. He noticed Daniel and practically skipped to his position. Daniel couldn't have braced himself out for the gibberish that followed.
<br />
<br />&quot;Wow you have a Dragon. I could help with those repairs if you want. Is that an advanced debilitator mounted? How did you handle the power load? Did you know there's another Dragon here somewhere?&quot;
<br />
<br />Daniel was taken aback. Seeing the look on his face, the man tried over.
<br />&quot;I'm sorry, I got a bit over enthusiastic back there. The name's Jimmy Yarlbough. I'm part of Mu flight, stationed on the cruiser <i>West Point.  </i> I'm a bit of a gearhead, as you've probably noticed.
<br />&quot;That's okay. I'm Daniel Morlone. I think I can understand your excitement.&quot; Daniel glanced around and let out a sheepish grin at the sight of everything going on.
<br />&quot;Anyway, I'm off to the <i>Vengeance  </i> to pick up Captian Quigley's <i>Cerulean Dream  </i>. The next shuttle won't leave for a bit, so I took another look around the maintenance bay. So many nice gadgets here.&quot;
<br />Daniel smiled. He liked this kid. And it was fun watching him go into his bursts of excitement. &quot;Hey, why don't you climb up and take a look at this.&quot; Daniel gestured to the cockpit. Jimmy curiously climbed up and took a look. A mad grin escaped his face as he saw the <i>Seer  </i>'s controls. Plus the headset which lay on the floor, plus the dual HUD overlays (allowing one to display objects in three dimensions). &quot;Amazing...&quot; was all he managed to say.
<br />Daniel couldn't stop smiling. Then he felt a bit guilty for showing off, so he reminded Jimmy of the shuttle. Obviously the young graduate couldn't bear waiting to get his hands on Quigley's <i>Dream  </i>.
<br />&quot;I'll catch you later,&quot; Daniel yelled out.
<br />&quot;Sure! We could try fixing up the ships together.&quot;
<br />&quot;I'd like that.&quot; And at that, Jimmy rounded the corner out of the maintenance bay. 
<br />
<br />Slowly Daniel returned to the <i>Seer.  </i> Sure, finding another techie was great. Then he noticed someone he recognized from the <i>Vengeance </i>'s crew, recently come off the shuttle, about to start to paint a bright, silverish, paint on the dragon.
<br />
<br />&quot;Excuse me, but what are you doing?&quot; He asked.
<br />The mechanic replied, &quot;Putting this new paint on your ship. It's supposed to reflect energy beams.&quot;
<br />Daniel's mind turned for a moment, then clicked. &quot;And light me up to every single scanner in the system! Don't you dare put that stuff on! Who's idea was it, anyway?&quot;
<br />&quot;Captian O'Connor's...&quot; Daniel sighed. Brilliant diplomat O'Connor was, he just didn't seem to be a thinker in the tech department.
<br />&quot;Could you inform the Captain that his new bullet-proof paint will light him up like a supernova?&quot;
<br />&quot;Sure.&quot;
<br />Daniel sighed again and started working on his ship. Now, where to find another fin?

<br />O'Connor: Yeh, whateva. You can have the broken Rhino somewhere in the bay.
<br />Rajur: Broken? You know I can't fix anything.
<br />*beep*
<br />O'Connor: Let Danson work on it. I'm kinda busy now.
<br />*Rajur left the bridge to inspect his newly accuired ship. He was complitly sattisfied when he found out that it can move.*
<br />James: Sir?
<br />O'Connor: Yeah?
<br />James: I'm here to pick up the Cerulean Dream .
<br />*beep*
<br />O'Connor: Oh, yeah. I'll send Danson, right down to bay, you can get it there. In the meantime feel free to look around.
<br />*James left to fighter bay*
<br />O'Connor: Good that Daniel told about the paint.
<br />Danson: Yeah, it might be useful though.
<br />O'Connor: Sure sure. You are just trying to cheer me up.
<br />Danson: No really, It would attract a lot of enemys. Think how it can be used as diversion?
<br />O'Connor: Yeah, and if we fit a mine on it, then enemys will just come to their own doom.
<br />*beep*
<br />O'Connor: That thing has been ringing all morning. I'll better check it out. Denson, you go down and see that guy James that Quigley sent to pick up his old ship.
<br />Danson: The names Danson not Denson.
<br />O'Connor: So... I like have said your name wrong all this time? 
<br />Danson: Yes.
<br />O'Connor: Then why didn't you tell me about it?
<br />*beep*
<br />O'Connor: Ah forget it. By the way is my uniform still on this ship?
<br />Danson: Yeah, it is, but why do you care. I haven't seen you wearing it never before. When was the last time yo wore it anyway?
<br />O'Connor: When was the last time pope visited Manhatten?
<br />*Roger walked to his quaters and took out his old uniform - the only place he could see for his true rank. Then he decided to see what message was someone beeping him about. After reading the message, Roger quicky stuffed his uniform to nearby suitcase and ran down to fighter bay with such haste that people who didn't hold on to something fell down.*
<br />Danson: Whats the matter?
<br />O'Connnor: Personal problems, gotta go!
<br />Danson: IN the middle of intergalactic war?
<br />O'Connor: Yeah something about it.
<br />Rajur: Take me along?
<br />O'Connor: Can't im in a great hurry.
<br />Danson: Good that I finished those speed accelators. By the way someone painted your fighter already.
<br />O'Connor: Wich paint?
<br />Danson: Mine.
<br />O'Connor: Good. Hey Rage, throw me your shield.
<br />*Rajur thorws his small shield to Roger*
<br />Danson: Where are you going.
<br />O'Connor: Manhatten.
<br />*Everybody turned their heads to the conversation*
<br />Danson: You got to be crazy! It deep in hostile territory.
<br />O'Connor: (now from his ship) I said I HAVE to go. Consider yourself promoted to capitain.
<br />*And saying that, he launched from cruiser and set course for New York system. He didn't want to ruin the other teams goals so he took another way. Thought that he would distract the enemy.*
<br />O'Connor: Now let's see if this speed accelerator works...
<br />*His ship dissapeared from sight in 3 seconds*

			<h3><a href="#p202412" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">Michael checked his watch and noticed it was almost time to go.
<br />
<br />&quot;Time?&quot; Lutz asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Almost.&quot; Michael replied.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nervous?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Not really.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Michael put his sigarette out on the floor and walked towards his ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;You know,&quot; said Michael, &quot;I've been thinking, it might be best if we change our shiptags. Liberty knows us and our shiptags. If they pick us up on their scanners, we're toast.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good idea, but how do you want to do that? You know those tags are coded.&quot; Lutz watched Michael get into his Falcon.
<br />
<br />&quot;You're forgetting I've been part of the Lane Hackers. They tought me all these need tricks, like changing your shiptag.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Michael typed in a code, wich gave him access to the mainsystem of his ship. He saw all kinds of codes scrolling past as the nueralnet perfomed a systemcheck.
<br />Suddenly the screen went black appart from one line:
<br />
<br />Nova Sailor  main system: 
<br />
<br />&quot;So, what tag do you have in mind?&quot; asked Michael and he peaked over the edge of his ship
<br />
<br />&quot;Navy?&quot; proposed Lutz.
<br />
<br />He still has a weak spot for the navy, Michael figured.
<br />
<br />&quot;I was thinking more of a Bounty Hunter tag. The navy has all it's codes registerred, just as the Police. They will know we're frauds as soon as they scan us.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And Bounty Hunters don't, good thinking. But Johnson and Malys may have a problem with it, since they are criminals.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, it's either this or they don't come along. I don't want to risk being discouvered just because someone doesn't like the Bounty Hunters.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael dived back into his cockpit and typed in a few codes. It took no more than five minutes and Michael got out of his Nova Sailor .
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm now Bounty Hunter Green One.&quot; Michael smiled. &quot;What do you think?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Green?&quot; Lutz looked at him and raised an eyebrow.
<br />
<br />&quot;What?&quot; Michael looked back and raised both his eyebrows. &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Never mind, it's allright.&quot; Lutz walked away to the Defiant .
<br />
<br />&quot;What?&quot; said Michael as he followed Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's allright Michael.&quot; Lutz opened his ship in order for Michael to get inside.
<br />
<br />&quot;You wanna be a different color Lutz?&quot; Shouted Michael from inside.&quot;
<br />
<br />At that moment Arrigoni walks up to them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, I got myself one kickass ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to retag you aswell Arrigoni.&quot; shouted Michael who was still working on the Defiant .
<br />
<br />&quot;What is he talking about?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We need a different tag, as a disguise.&quot; explained Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, my ship is over there.&quot; Arrigoni pointed at a bright new Stilleto.
<br />
<br />Michael got out of Lutz's ship and walked over to the Stilleto.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice ship, Arrigoni. What did you name it?&quot;
<br />
<br />Arrigoni and Lutz joined Michael. &quot;It's got no name.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You know it needs a name. It's for good fortune.&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;All that supersticion, not for me. I'll think of a name later.&quot;
<br />
<br />After a few minutes Arrigoni was Bounty Hunter Green Three. Lutz was Green Two.
<br />
<br />Johnson and Malys were not pleased with the namechange, as expected, but after a few arguments they agread.
<br />
<br />Just as they were ready to leave, May walked up to the five.
<br />
<br />&quot;So, I see you got extra security. That's good, because I was just comming to say that the escort you would get, was needed elsewhere.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I guess that the five of us are allright.&quot; said Michael. &quot;We changed our ship tags to a Bounty Hunter tag. We're patrol Green. So don't be alarmed when you see Bounty Hunters on your scanner, it might just be us.&quot;
<br />
<br />May smiled, &quot;Looks like you guys are good to go then. Be carefull out there.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We will.&quot; said Michael.
<br />
<br />He turned around to the rest, &quot;Ok, we're leaving, are you guys filled up?&quot;
<br />
<br />They all replied affirmative and got into their ships.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />A few seconds later a brand new stilleto, a Wolfhound, a Dragon, a Defender-XS and a Falcon left Malaga and set course for the jumphole to Sigma 17.
<br />
<br />Michael checked his scanner more out of habbit than anything other. Besides the Vengeance  and the West Point , only a few ship showed, Probably maintainance and supplyships and one single Anubis. At first Michael thought it was one of O'Connors ship, doing transport runs between Malaga and the Vengeance , but he realised that the distance to the Mysterious Anubis was decreasing, ruling out that option. He noticed that the ship wastagged as an Outcast. 
<br />But they only flew Daggers, Stilletoes, and Sabres, Michael thought.
<br />He targeted the ship. It was definitifely an Anubis, but it was heavily modified.
<br />Michael switched on his comm.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, do you see that Anubis on your scanner?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, what about it?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Could that be O'Connor?&quot; 
<br />Michael looked through his window to see if he could spot the unidentified ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;You think he's back allready?.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, he's heading our way, so...&quot;
<br />
<br />But before Michael could finish his sentence, the Anubis dropped out of cruise and fired a couple off cruisedisruptors.
<br />
<br />&quot;Everyone, break formation!&quot; yelled Michael as he dropped a few countermeasures and the disruptors zipped past him, Lutz and Johnson, who were on his right side.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is defenetively <b>not </b> O'Connor!&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />Arrigoni and Malystrix were hit and dropped out of cruise.
<br />
<br />Immediately the Anubis started to attack them and locked on to Malys's Dragon.
<br />
<br />&quot;What the hell was that? Why did he attack us?&quot; shouted Johnson over the comms.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're tagged as Bounty Hunters, remember?&quot; Said Michael as he took the Nova Sailor  around and headed back to Arrigoni and Malystrix, followed by Lutz and Johnson.
<br />
<br />In the mean time, Malystrix was receiving heavy fire from the mysterious fighter. Arrigoni tried desperatly to take a few shots at the Anubis, but it always managed to evade the shots.
<br />
<br />Michael knew he had to act quickly, before anyone got shot appart.
<br />
<br />&quot;Guys, help me out here, my shields are almost down and I'm down to my last few bats!&quot; 
<br />
<br />Michael targeted the shield generator of the Anubis and lined up for a shot.
<br />The Avarice started spinning and very soon a couple of dozen ionbolts impacted into the shield, wich dissolved in a few seconds. A clear shot with one of his lasers took care of the shieldgenerator.
<br />
<br />&quot;Unidentified ship, stop your assult or you will be distroyed.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Killzone to Bounty Hunters, you won't take me alive.&quot;
<br />
<br />He lined up for another attack.
<br />
<br />Sh*t, this guy is determined, Michael thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mister Killzone, let me explain the situation to you. We are in no way hostile toward you, but we will take you down if we have to. Now, stop all hostile activities.&quot;
<br />
<br />He seemed to hesitate and finally realised that he didn't stand a chance against five fighter in a shieldless fighter. Special ship, or no special ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't let looks fool you,&quot; said Michael, &quot;dispite what our shiptags may say, we are everything but Bounty Hunters and we are certainly not after you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Then what are you?&quot;
<br />
<br />That was a logical question, Michael figured.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's, a bit of a long story and we don't have the time to explain it, but I sugest you land on Malaga base wich is right ahead. They will repair your shieldgenerator.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Does this have anything to do with the war?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; said Michael, &quot;Look, just land there and perhaps someone will imform you about the situation. We can always use a good fighter.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, I will.&quot; The Anubis increased to max speed and left.
<br />
<br />&quot;How rude,&quot; said Malystrix, &quot;He didn't even apolagise.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you allright Malys?&quot; asked Johnson.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm fine, but I better be carefull in battle, I have only enough bats for one full shield.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, we'd better keep an extra eye on you.&quot; Michael said that as he turned his ship toward the Sigma 17 jumphole.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, lets go. This incdent costed us to much time already.&quot;
<br />
<br />They all formed up behind Michael, the Defiant  on his right and the Vasrak  on his left wing. Johnson followed Lutz and Arrigoni formed up behind Malystrix.
<br />
<br />They had a clean trip to the Sigma 17 jumphole and headed straight to the Frankfurt jumphole.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's only 30k to the next jumphole guys.'said Michael, &quot;We end up somewhere behind Planet Holstein. Unfortunately the Bering jumphole is on the far side of Frankfurt, wich means we need to cruise accross the entire system.&quot;
<br />
<br />Arrigoni sighed, &quot;Oh man, this is gonna be one hell of a trip.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We should be alright with our Bounty Hunter status.&quot; Michael assured him.
<br />
<br />&quot;I hope you're right Michael.&quot; Mumbled Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />In fact, Michael wasn't so sure about it himself. In Liberty, Bounty Hunters were often regarded as criminals and he didn't know the role of the Bounty Hunters in this war.
<br />Fact of the matter was, that Liberty often relied on Bounty Hunters to do their dirty work.
<br />
<br />He had to take his mind of the matter, because they had made it to the juphole.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, I'll go first. Johnson, you follow, then Arrigoni, Malys and Lutz. I don't know what it will be like on the other side, so expect the worst.&quot;
<br />
<br />They all acknowledged and Michael took the jump.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />The blue haze of the jumphole disappeared and Michael brased himself for the sudden deceleration and the expected ambush.
<br />But space was silent and empty as always, appart from the astroids wich were surrounding him.
<br />
<br />Michael checked his scanner for any ships in the area, it was clean. He switched to static objects and noticed two Battleships, four cruisers and twelve Gunships, equally devided to guard the jumpgates. They must not be aware of this jumphole, Michael thought.
<br />
<br />He noticed how Johnson had made it after him and Michael made room for the others as they arrived.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, it's not exactly rush hour, is it?&quot; said Arrigoni.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, thank god it's not.&quot; answered Lutz, &quot;But I'm sure you noticed those Battlefleets at the jumpgates.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, I noticed,&quot; said Michael, &quot;But we wont be going anywhere close to those battleships. Form up behind me, I know the way.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael accelerated to normal speed and waited until they had formed up and engaged his cruise engines.
<br />
<br />They rounded planet Holstein and came through the astroidfield wich once held Bruchsal base, the home of the Bundschuh.
<br />
<br />&quot;They took down Bruchsal.&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />They were all quite. Michael silently cursed the Rheinlanders for such atrocity. But he didn't have to much time to think about the fallen Bundschuh, because he suddenly picked up a wing of Valkyries.
<br />15K to the jumphole and Michael was sure that those Rheinlanders were clever enough to draw their own conclusions.
<br />
<br />&quot;Stay calm everyone, we've got company.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn.&quot; said Lutz, &quot;We were so close.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Rheinland Navy Kappa six, to Bounty Hunters, this is a restricted area, leave at once, or you will be distroyed.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Boutny Hunter Green one, we were not aware that Frankfurt has become a restricted area, we were just on our way to the Bering system.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You are aware that Bounty Hunters are banned from all house systems in Rheinland, aren't you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No, that message must have not reached us, we're fresh out of the Omicron systems. There's a lot of interfearence there.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael hoped they would accept the lie.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sure there is,&quot; said a sceptical Rheinlander. &quot;We'll escort you out of the system. Lead the way.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You haven't seen a bunch of runaway pirates with a cruiser and a battleship, have you? We have reason to beleve they are holding up somwhere in the borderworlds.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michaels senses were on full alert. The Rheinlanders knew that the Loyalists were somewhere in the borderworlds! But they could do nothing more than hope that May got them out of there in time.
<br />
<br />&quot;No,&quot; lied Michael, &quot;we haven't seen anything but Corsairs and Zoners.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Be sure to let us know where they are if you find out, there is a nice reward waiting for the guy who can point us to them. Here we are. Jump and stay out of Rheinland.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We will, thanks for the escort.&quot; said Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, guys, follow me.&quot; he said to the rest. after a minute, they found themselfs in the Bering system.
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />&quot;This must be the loneliest place in Sirius.&quot; said Johnson.
<br />
<br />He had hit the nail square on the head. Appart from the abandoned Freeport, there was nothing, no ships and no stations. The Criminals were ofcourse totaly whiped out and the Zoners must have fled to a saver place in Sirius. Probably Freeport 9.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lets go.&quot; said Michael.
<br />
<br />He could feal the depression set in by himself and the others. But they couldn't be distracted by this, they had a job to do and that job was only one jump away. Time to get concentrated.
<br />
<br />The jumphole to Texas was closeby and very soon they had jumped.
<br />
<br />Michael was releaved to see that LPI Sugarland was still therem but they had to hurry.
<br />
<br />&quot;Are you ready for this?&quot; he asked and without waiting for an answer he went to cruise speed, pleased to see that they all followed him.
<br />
<br />&quot;But offcourse, Michael.&quot; said Johnson, who had a score to settle.
<br />
<br />In front of them LPI Sugarland apeared, they could see two Cruisers and a few wings of fighters. Michael checkd his scanners and saw that the Cruisers and about twenty of the fighters belonged to the Liberty Navy. About seven fighters tried desperatly to defend the station.
<br />
<br />&quot;Looks like we're just in time guys.&quot; said Michael, &quot;Johnson, Arrigoni and Malys, you take out those fighters. Lutz, you and I take down those Cruisers. I have an Avarice and will take down their shields and you better warm up your Fireblade, we'll be needing it.&quot;
<br />
<br />four checks signed in and the everybody got ready for battle.
<br />
<br />Johnson grinned his teath, this was what he was waiting for. Arrigoni had a lot of confidence in his Stilleto, but for certainty he quickly christened his ship the Sword of Justice , just to be sure. Stupid supersticion, he thought. Malystrix was all exited, finally a good fight, she thought. 
<br />Lutz hoped that the capacitor needed to fire the Fireblade would hold out and that he hadn't usd it to much already. He opened one of his chestpockets and took out a picture of a beautifull blonde (OOC: I'm guessing she's a blonde Lutz <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>) and kissed it.
<br />
<br />&quot;Don't worry baby,&quot; he mumbled to himself, &quot;I'm comming for you after this.&quot; Then he stuck the picture behind the edge of his scanner.
<br />
<br />Michael was excited to try out his Avarice and to see if they could pull this off. At 2.5k away, they dropped out of cruise.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lets do this!&quot; he shouted and the five engaged battle.
<br />
<br />(OOC: edited out some stupidities in the second paragraph <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)
<br />(OOC#2: More stupidities <img src=smilies/icon_smile_sad.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>)

			<div class="content">Michael turned down his comm unit due to the fact that Johnson had screamed a war cry into it.
<br />
<br />&quot;THIS ONE'S FOR DAWSON!!&quot; Johnson had screamed. He punched the afterburner and made sure he was the first one into battle. Although it would be nice if he survived this battle, Johnson would be perfectly content if he went down in a fiery blaze of glory with several Defenders along the way.
<br />
<br />Johnson opened up to a fighter with a salve of four Vassagos, and launched two Slingshot missiles into the shieldless Defender, which exploded in red and orange.
<br />
<br />&quot;YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAW!!!&quot; yelled Johnson. &quot;First kill! Oh yeah!&quot; A lot of primal Texas instinct was coming out in this battle.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice, shooting.&quot; said Lutz. By that time, everyone else had begun engaging at that time, and Johnson turned around to go for another pass. He caught eye of the rest of the people fighting. Michael was doing a nice round ona cruiser with the Avarice. Lutz was avoiding fighting while his firestorm charged. Arrigoni's Stilleto flew with great grace and skill as it caused a star flare of a Defender. Malystryx was fighting unlike he had ever seen before. She was doing well.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice shot Arrigoni!&quot; Johnson screamed. &quot;Here goes another one!&quot;
<br />
<br />Johnson was going head on with a defender. He fired his four Vassagos well before range. He could see that he was shooting, but the Defender was pounding on his shields and he couldn't tell wether he was hitting it or not. Just before collision, he veered to the left. He managed to get right on the tail of the Defender, and he shredded him to bits. He punched the button for shield batteries. He cut his engines and turned around.
<br />
<br />&quot;That's two!&quot; Johnson shouted.
<br />
<br />&quot;Damn! Just got my first!&quot; Arrigoni exclaimed
<br />
<br />In the corner of his eye, he saw Lutz fire off a powerful blue beam. It hit the cruiser and made the sections it hit glow red. The only time he had seen something similar was footage from the Five-Capitol ship battle, as it was dubbed.
<br />
<br />He started off again, and flew straight into the heck of it, firing all the way. He fired of one Slingshot missile, which hit a wing of a Defender, causing it to spin, and soon explode.
<br />
<br />He was surprised at his performance, for never actually being in combat before. He looked down at his Neural Net. Most of his shields were gone. He didn't have many shield batteries left. He closed his eyes for a second as he flew through an explosion caused by Arrigoni's skilled shooting. He pitched upwards, and caught a glimpse of the destruction Lutz had wrought on the cruiser. Damn that thing is powerful, he thought.
<br />
<br />He rolled and turned around, coming face to face with a Defender, which broke his shields and began pounding on his hull. He instinctively launched a Slingshot missile, which the Defender evaded. Still though, Johnson got several shots off from his Vassagos, which made the thing burst into flames. Johnson punched his shield bat button. They rose marginally.
<br />
<br />Johnson turned slightly left, and saw one of the restistance Defenders meet a fiery end. He bowed his head and crossed himself in respect. He almost ran into Malystryx, who had managed to just destroy one Defender.
<br />
<br />&quot;Nice shooting, Malys.&quot; Johnson said. As he was talking, he saw Michael finish the shields of the second cruiser, and both of them blast the hell out of it with missiles. &quot;You two are a damn fine team!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks. You're not too bad yourself.&quot; Michael responded.
<br />
<br />Johnson veered left and ended up on Arrigoni's right wing. They together destroyed a Defender.
<br />
<br />&quot;Was that mine or yours?&quot; Arrigoni asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's say it was mine.&quot; Johnson said. He met the Defender he had sent into flames. He fired a few rounds of Vassago fire off, and it was destroyed, but not before his shields completely failed, and he heard thuds on his hull.
<br />
<br />His HUD indicated that there was only one enemy Defender left. He turned to face it. He was coming head on. He slowed down to make the shot. Then from the corner of his vision, Malystryx comes and unceremoniously takes his kill.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey!&quot; Johnson said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I have no sympathy for you.&quot; Malystryx said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whatever.&quot; Johnson thought about what he had just done. He had five kills. In flight terms, that meant he was an ace.
<br />
<br />There were only three of the seven Defenders that were defending the station left, and the cruisers' hulls smoked with the damage caused by the Michael and Lutz. Everyone was pretty beat up.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whew.&quot; Michael said. &quot;Tough battle, eh?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No kidding.&quot; said the leader of the three Defenders. &quot;We're thankful for your assistance.&quot; They weren't too happy about the death of their comrades, and fighting against Liberty. Johnson thought how bad they must've had it. They had wives, girlfriends, family, children. And they could be killed so easily. It's a terrible world, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;How are we holding up?&quot; Michael asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Two, holding together.&quot; Lutz said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Three, took a beating, but I'll be ok.&quot; Arrigoni replied.
<br />
<br />Johnson looked at the damage report and around his ship. &quot;Green Four, a little smoke, that's all.&quot; It was alot worse than that.
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Five, relatively okay.&quot; Malystryx had somehow managed to get out of the battle with few scratches. Something wasn't right about her, he thought.
<br />
<br />Johnson wiped the sweat off his brow. &quot;Okay, land on the LPI Sugarland.&quot; Michael said.

			<div class="content">(OOC: Malys, where are you?)
<br />
<br />Michael turned his comm down when Johnson let out a fearsome warcry.
<br />&quot;Don't get yourself killed kid.&quot; he said to himself.
<br />He took a quick look at the Defiant , he couldn't see Lutz though. But Michael didn't need to see Lutz to know he was ready.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm engaging the first cruiser Lutz, watch my back.&quot; Michael targeted the nearest cruiser and unlocked the trigger for the Avarice.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm right behind you Michael.&quot; said Lutz as he fired all his guns at a Defender. The Defender never stood a chance.
<br />
<br />The avarice spun and Michael fired a couple of dozen shots at the cruiser right before he past under it. Michael saw on his scanners that the shield was down.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do it Lutz!&quot; Michael shouted in a strange form of excitement.
<br />
<br />Michaels cockpit lit up as the Fireblade cut through the thick layers of steel, like a hot knife through butter. The particle beam must have hit the main reactor, because the back of the cruiser suddenly exploded and ripped through half of the ship. Michael could see debree being sucked into space and he was sure he saw a few bodies floating away. Some of them hit Sugarland and left distinctive red marks on the prisonstations exterior.
<br />
<br />&quot;I hope this is over soon.&quot; Michael said to himself.
<br />
<br />Just then he heard Lutz over the comm.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, help me out here, I got two bandits on my six.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm on my way, hold on.&quot; Michael saw Lutz behind what was left of the first cruiser and the two Defenders that were on his tail.
<br />
<br />&quot;Make it fast Michael, there taking down my shield and that other cruiser is giving me hell.&quot;
<br />
<br />But Michael was already on it. He selcted the first Defender and fire his Avarice. The shield droped after four rounds, after wich Michael finished the job with his standard guns.
<br />
<br />The Defender exploded right in front of him, but Michael couldn't evade the blast and had to fly right through it. The explosion rocked his Falcon badly and Michael felt as though he was going through a tradelane in a vacsuit.
<br />All aroud him warninglights were flashing and a siren shouted in his ear. Apart from his primal functions, wich include the docking system and the climatecontrol, everything was down, including his Avarice.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael, what is going on?&quot; asked Lutz as he was chasing the other Defender.
<br />
<br />&quot;All of my secondairy functions are offline, I can't do anything but dock.&quot; Michael tried desperately to get his neuralnet back online, while at the same time he needed to avoid the turrets from the second cruiser. That was why he didn't noticed the Defender who was comming straight at him. The defender took care of his shields in one pass and he heared the &quot;Shield failed&quot; warning.
<br />
<br />Great, he thought, at least it can tell me I'm being blown to bits.
<br />
<br />&quot;I CAN SEE THAT FOR MY SELF YOU PIECE OF SH*T!!!&quot; yelled Michael and he hit his neuralnet out of sheer frustration. It flashed twice and then came back online.
<br />
<br />He sighed in releaf, at least now he could use his guns. He quickly punched his bats and his shield recharched.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm good to go Lutz,&quot; said Michael as he lined up with the second cruiser. He let his Avarice rip through the shield and fired a couple of missiles, just to releave the stress of the situation. He knew very well Lutz would take care of the cruiser with his Fireblade.
<br />
<br />But Lutz's Fireblade didn't respond and there was no great explosion ripping the cruiser apart.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, what the hell is wrong, fire that damn thing, so we can get those people outa here!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I would if I could Michael, but it's jammed, I'm guessing the capacitor has finally quit it.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Great,&quot; said Michael, &quot;then we need to take it down with our bare hands so to speak. How much missiles do you have left?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I have five cannonballs.&quot; Lutz replied.
<br />
<br />&quot;And I have about ten catapults, that should do the trick. Go for the engine first and then take out the docking bay doors.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You got it.&quot; said Lutz and he and Michael lined up next to eachother. This time he could see Lutz and he raised his thumb. Lutz replied the gesture and together they engaged the last cruiser.
<br />
<br />They fired there first salvo of missiles at 1k away and at 800 they started blazing with there guns. The missiles impacted directly at the engine, wich started to dim for a couple of seconds as it needed time to restore to full power. But before power was completely restored, gunfire slammed mercilessly on the engine, wich started to shimmer and after a short strugle, it went offline.
<br />
<br />Michael turned around and lined up again. He fired two missiles at the engine and turned away to stay clear of the blast area. An explosion rocked the cruiser as the core exploded.
<br />Michael could feal pieces off scrapmetal hitting his shield, as he turned around to engage the docking bay doors as planned. But saw that Lutz had allready taken care of it, using up his last Cannonballs.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, nice work man,&quot; Michael complimented.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks, you were not so bad yourself either.&quot; replied Lutz.
<br />
<br />The three remaining loyalist who were fighting outside Sugarland came alongside Michael and Lutz.
<br />
<br />Whew.&quot; Michael said. &quot;Tough battle, eh?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No kidding.&quot; said the leader of the three Defenders. &quot;We're thankful for your assistance.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;You're welcome,&quot; said Michael, &quot;How's everyone doing?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Two, holding together.&quot; Lutz said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Three, took a beating, but I'll be ok.&quot; Arrigoni replied.
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Four, a little smoke, that's all.&quot; Michael looked at Johnsons ship. That's more than just a litle smoke, Michael thought, he must have fought one hell of a battle.
<br />
<br />&quot;Green Five, relatively okay.&quot; said Malystrix, who had managed to survive without using one single bat.
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok guys, land and refuel. We'll be leaving shortly.&quot;
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />LPI Sugarland looked like a real hellhole. There must have been a huge battle here, Michael figured as he walked away from his badly damaged Falcon, to the three loyalists who helped them through battle.
<br />Lutz, Arrigoni, Johnson and Malystrix followed closely.
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks again,&quot; said the leader, &quot;I'm Stephen Walker, I kinda lead this pack of rebels.&quot; He and Michael shook hands.
<br />
<br />&quot;Michael Armstrong, looks like you had one hell of fight in here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, we somehow managed to bust out and we were able to overtake the guards. But we lost a lot of good men in the process.&quot;
<br />
<br />A few guys entered the docking bay and Walker instructed them to refuel the fighters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Most of us were captured by Liberty after we refused orders or simply after questioning the motives of our superiors,&quot; Walker continued, &quot;but there are also a lot of civilians here who stood up against the new regime. But what are you guys doing here? You took a lot of chances coming here, housespace is forbidden territory for Bounty Hunters and we allmost engaged you. But then we noticed how you took down one of those cruisers and we kinda gave you the benefit of the doubt.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael smiled, &quot;We are not Bounty Hunters, we're here because we heard that a group of loyalists were stuck on LPI Sugarland and needed a little help from the outside. We also heard that the president was taken here aswell.&quot; said Michael.
<br />
<br />&quot;That is correct.&quot; the voice came from behind Walker, who stepped aside.
<br />
<br />&quot;I see that my message recieved Frederick in time.&quot; The man walked right up to Michael and the rest.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mister president, sir,&quot; said Michael, &quot;we've come to get you and the rest out of here.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Please,&quot; said the president, &quot;ever since the Navy took over, I go by my name, Geoffrey Washington. And you need a lot more than a few ships to get us all out of here I'm afraid. We are with about seventy five people here, you need at least a cruiser for that.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sir?&quot; Walker turned around to talk to the man who required his attention.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's a shame we didn't know that sooner,&quot; said Lutz, &quot;or we would have spared one of those cruisers out there.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Maybe we can repair...&quot; started Johnson, but Walker interrupted them.
<br />
<br />&quot;We need to get ready guys, we jusy picked up a battleship on the scanners.&quot;
<br />
<br />The sirens started yelling and they all ran to their ships.
<br />
<br />&quot;A battleship?&quot; said Arrigoni, &quot;haven't we had enough allready?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Getting tired Arrigoni?&quot; asked Lutz as he strapped himself in.
<br />
<br />&quot;No, hungry.&quot; replied Arrigoni as he closed the canopy.
<br />
<br />The loyalists were reinforced with two more guys and ten fighters left the station.
<br />
<br />&quot;Battleship incomming, 10k way.&quot; said Walker, &quot;I detect no escort, only a battleship.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael scanned the Battleship, just out of curiosity. What he saw made him wonder if there was a god after all.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lutz, Arrigoni, that's the Arizona !&quot; shouted Michael excited.
<br />
<br />&quot;Holy cow, you're right.&quot; said Lutz. &quot;How does it get here?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What I want to know,&quot; said Arrigoni, &quot;is this baby gonna attack us?&quot;
<br />
<br />But the Arizona  answered that question.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Captain Ralph Breuer of the Battleship Arizona , to loyalist fighters. Stand down, we are here to help you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ofcourse!&quot; said Lutz, &quot;those are the Junkers we left behind after the battle, they must have repaired the engine.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Michael Armstrong to all loyalist fighters in the area. Do not, I repeat, do not engage the Battleship.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Afirmative, all fighters, stand down and hold posistion. Michael, you better be damn sure about this, or I will personally kick your ass into that large ball of burning gass over there.&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael knew this was some kind of a guess, but he had to take the risk. A battleship would certainly be able to carry everybody from LPI Sugarland and provide security along the way.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mister Breuer, may I ask you how you got that Battleship?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah, some criminals left it behind with a busted engine after a huge fight with the navy. They took down three cruisers and god knows how many fighters. They said we could strip it, but who strips down a virtually intact battleship, when all you gotta do is get the engines back online? The gold in the cargohold, more than payed for the repaires. Why don't you come aboard and we address the situation?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; said Lutz.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah Michael,&quot; said Arrigoni, &quot;He sure makes sense.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok, Walker, you follow me. We'll go aboard. Lutz, when things go bad I trust on you to take care of the rest. Don't hessitate to blow this thing to bit's while we're still on it, ok?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Roger that.&quot;
<br />
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Michael and Walker stepped out of their ships and were greeted with an array of blasters.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhm.&quot; said Walker.
<br />
<br />&quot;Guys, guys. No nead for the guns. There's only two of us.&quot; said Michael in an attept to persuade them to lower their guns.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lower 'em guys, it's allright.&quot; The man spoke with an unmistakeable Rheinland accent and walked up to them.
<br />
<br />&quot;Captain Ralph Breuer, leader of the remaining Junkers. Nice to meet you.&quot; they shook hands and Breuer continued.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm sorry for the rude welcome, but you must understand. The last few days have been rather, disturbing and many are quite easy on the trigger. You have to forgive them, but I'm sure you will.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Now, you want to know what we are doing here, right? I'll explain. About a day ago we picked up a badly wounded pilot. He said he escaped from a fight at LPI Sugarland against the Liberty Navy and barely made it. He died in sickbay from his injuries, but told us about the prez being here and a bunch of other guys. We figured, we might help them out. So here we are.&quot;
<br />
<br />He looked content with his decision and waited to here it from Michael or Walker.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, I'm glad you came, we can really use your help.&quot;Walker said. &quot;There is about 75 people in there and Liberty has been attacking us constantly. We're holding on, but only for so long. We'd be glad if You could escort us to a saver place.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sure.&quot; said Breuer, &quot;Do you have a place in mind?&quot;
<br />
<br />Michael told him about the Loyalists and Malaga Base and the possibility that they had to go to Kyoto.
<br />
<br />Breuer wistled, &quot;That's gonna be a bumpy ride. We'd be best of if we head straight for Kusari then.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's gonna be tough, if not impossible. Kusari has surrendered to the Rheinlanders and is probably infested with them already. Brettonia might be the only place save for us now.&quot; Michael said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bretonia, hmm, I know a few people in the navy there.&quot; said Walker. &quot;We might have a chance indeed.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Good, that's what we'll do then. Is there a way you could contact them?&quot; Breuer looked at Walker.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm afraid not. It's to far out and the risk that Liberty intercepts the message is to great. We'll just have to surprise them I guess.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ok then, I'll move to Sugarland and instruct my man to transport people and goods.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We'll see you there.&quot; said Michael and he and Walker left the Arizona .
<br />
<br />Michael knew they had to hurry, because Liberty could be back any moment. At least they had an escort now. But somehow he had to get a message to May, because they weren't coming to Malaga or Kyoto anytime soon. Maybe something for Malystrix, he thought on his way to Sugarland.
<br />

			<div class="content">&quot;Awwwwwww, Sh*t!&quot; Johnson exclaimed loudly in the docking bay.
<br />
<br />His ship was completely messed up. The wiring was fried, the hull was beaten incredibly badly, his fuel was leaking, many systems were down. To top it all off, his ship was turned black because of all the scorch marks.
<br />
<br />But he was going to repair this mess. He was going to make it better than it was when it first flew out of the factory. He was going to make it his ship. Not the Resourceful , which he still had a sentimental affection for, but rather the Reviven , for rising out of the ashes of this positive mess. And he was going to get rid of that offensive bounty hunter tag!
<br />
<br />Johnson made a checklist of things he would need in his mind. He might as well buy a new ship, because the cost was going to be more than he had ever had in his life, much more than he could afford. He also envisioned what the final product would be. It would be shiny (of course), have two Starkiller Torpedo launchers, Four Vassagos, a Thoth Turret, Driller Mines, Adv. Countermeasures, an Adv. Sentinel shield, an Adv. Thruster, a better Power cell, all tweaked to give more performance than they would originally. He'd have to give two arms and two legs to pay for it, but he still wanted it.
<br />
<br />A transport had arrived from the Arizona  to carry goods and supplies. He asked the person who came from the ship if he could fit a Wolfhound on it, because Johnson did not feel safe flying in that thing in it's current condition.
<br />
<br />The man said yes, and Johnson boarded the transport. I dunno, he thought. This is a Junker ship. Gotta have lots and lots of excess parts.

			<div class="content">malystryx: &quot;when will the next transport be here from the Arizona?&quot;
<br />tech: &quot;4 hours but it is the last one&quot;
<br />malystryx: &quot;did the junkers get any intact defender-XSs? ooh, never mind, dumb question of course they did&quot;
<br />tech: what ever you say&quot;
<br />
<br />tech walks away from malys. she turns to her scorched dragon.  hmm i need either a sheild from one of those defenders or a better sheild bat capacity, or else i might have to get a better ship, i heard there was a new wyvern class heavy fighter in development  she thought. she ducked under the wing of her fighter and ran into a man in a liberty security force uniform. 
<br />
<br />mysterious man: uuhh excuse me are you malystryx?
<br />malys: yes, why?
<br />mysterious man: i need to give you a message
<br />malys: what is it?
<br />mysterious man: the message is: &quot;the guardians are wary, beware&quot; 
<br />malys: what does that mean?
<br />mysterious man: i dont know i am just the messanger 
<br />malys: what is  your name?
<br />mysterious man: i can't tell you
<br />
<br />the man walks around the end of the fighter. malys rushes after him, when she rounds the corner he has disappeared.
<br />
<br />malys: the guardians are wary, beware? what does that mean? ohh well i got to see about those defender parts 
<br />
<br />ooc: well this is my first jab i tried to get the spelling errors out. 
<br />ooc2: what do you think?
<br />ooc3: wonder if i could get a bat storage part from a defender XS?
<br />ooc4: &quot;the guardians are wary, beware&quot; good mention of FL story don't you think?

			<div class="content">OOC: My first post, now revamped! Hope you enjoy
<br />
<br />Predator cruised though empty space, approaching Malaga. Its piolt, Killzone, was busying himself with swearing at his recent fortune.
<br />
<br />Killzone: ***** those ***** **** ***!!!!
<br />A blinking light on his nerual net draged him from his rage. Pressing a button to see what it was he saw a sight he really wasnt expecting.
<br />Killzone: What? SysOps, show Agressor 1-1s ship.... I dont belive it...SysOps, verify the probability that this scan is correct.
<br />
<br />SysOps: Probability at 100%
<br />Killzone: My God... thats just saved months of searching now..
<br />He was cut off by Malaga docking control
<br />
<br />DC: Outcasts Alpha 1-1, you are cleared to dock... but watch out, were pretty full at the moment.
<br />Killzone: Roger that docking control
<br />
<br />He looked about the landing pad for anyone looking remotly like a mechanic.
<br />Killzone: Hey, HEY!! You a mechanic?
<br />Mech: Yeah, what you want done?
<br />Killzone: Just got shot up and my Sheild Generator is down... and try an fix the cannon in the hold onto my Torp hardpoint will you? And if you an your an your freinds can do this within the hour, Ill pay you five times the standard price.
<br />Mech: YES SIR!! Cmon! You heard the man! Get workin!
<br />
<br />He looked about the hanger on the way to the bar. The guy on Docking Control wasnt kiding when he said this place was full.. there were ships from every criminal faction in Sirius.. Rouges, GC, Hackers and .... <i>Corsairs </i>. He almost spat at the ships as he passed them.
<br />He focused back on the corridor and wandered into the bar, which was even more crowded that the hangar.
<br />He managed to find a seat at the bar an sat down.
<br />Bartender: Whatll it be?
<br />Killzone: Engien Degreaser...
<br />Bartender: A what?
<br />Killzone: Engien Degreaser... argh Ill show you..
<br />He produced three bottles.
<br />Killzone: Watch an learn. Three parts Moonshine, One part Cardamine and Six drops of H Fuel
<br />The bartender just stared at him. He looked even worse when he started to drink it.
<br />
<br />Killzone: So anyway, I was told by a &quot;reliable&quot; source someone here could tell me whats going on. Whats the deal with all the ships. Something about the war I aint heard yet?
<br />Bartender: Well... yeah, all these guys bases throughout Liberty and Rhineland have been wipe out... completly slagged they say! Some people reckon its some kind of super weapons!
<br />Killzone: You never know...
<br />
<br />But he knew more than that... far more than that...
<br />Bartender: So what are you doing here? Havent seen all that many Outcasts recently...
<br />Killzone: To put a long story short: I was flying around when the Hunters decided to start some kind of crusade against me... bearly lost them and got here in one peice... Man, things are getting outta hand...
<br />
<br />He drank the rest of his drink and just sat, watching the news. Hed been at it almost an hour when a young Outcast piolt interrupted.
<br />
<br />Outcast: Excuse me..
<br />Killzone: [Very Irritated What! The hell do you want boy?
<br />Outcast: They told me you would ract like that...
<br />He grabbed the man and planted him against the wall
<br />Killzone: Who said? Cmon! Aint got all day!
<br />Outcast: [Little Shaken Uggh, Alpha wing Sir...
<br />He dropped him
<br />Killzone: Alpha wing huh? Ohh I see, your my check up arent you! What do you want to know?
<br />Outcast: Don Carleone wants to know if you found them, and if our suprise is working...
<br />Killzone: Right, follow me then.
<br />As he went to the door to show the Piolt the wat to his ship he turned round.
<br />Killzone: And how are Alpha wing anyway?
<br />
<br />This was good. Now he had his progress report to hand in, the next step could continue: Testing.
<br />But hold up, he thought, I still need a capasitor for that thing. And were the hell on this base am I gonna find a capasitor?
<br />As if reading his thoughts, the Outcast piolt chimed in.
<br />Outcast: And if your wondering, we have a capasitor for it...
<br />Killzone: Good... right here we go...
<br />Outcast: Woah....
<br />
<br />Predator sat on the deck, in full glory, a massive cannon now slung under the cockpit. Killzone walked over to it, the Outcast not being able to take his eyes off it.
<br />Killzone: Well, Ill make this short. I have things to do. Ive found and scanned the blueprints of both Fireblade and Avarice... here you go.. and with the capasitor youve given me, this should be ready to fire.
<br />Outcast: Thank you sir, youve help speed up our milltarisation ten fold.
<br />Killzone: I know, cmon, an ex Commander for the Outcasts, still working for them, trying to blow the whole war thing to dust for his own good with an uber cannon has to know these things, kid. Oh and weres the capasitor?
<br />Outcast: Its already mounted sir, ready to go!
<br />Killzone: Right, okay kid, you can go.
<br />Outcast: Yes Sir!
<br />Killzone watched the man run off to his ship, and decided to do something about the war going on around him. He went back to the bar, were the bartender told him about the rebel cruiser <i>West Point </i> which was nearby.
<br />He fineshed his second drink, looked around and saw nothing better to do than try and get some work on this cruiser.
<br />Killzone: If I can help stop this war I will..... What irony, Im an Outcast trying to keep everything normal...
<br />He broke into luaghted as he thought of the abserdity of it... An Outcast trying to save the peace... even though it was for the good of his Outcast brothers...
<br />

			<div class="content">Johnson had seen the docking bay of the <i>Arizona </i> before. Except, this time, he didn't have hand cuffs. The sight brough memories he did not want to remember. Such is life, he thought.
<br />
<br />The bay was busy with commotion, as mechanics and cargo loaders worked quickly to unload the transport that he had just come off of. He watched as the <i>Reviven </i> was brought off, and a sizeable chunk of the hull fell off, much to the laughter of everybody there.
<br />
<br />&quot;What kind of moron would keep a piece of junk like that!?!&quot; A mechanic asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Certainly not the Junkers!!&quot; A cargo loader responded. Everyone roared with laughter. The insult felt like a razor blade twisting in his heart, but he knew how to suck it up.
<br />
<br />He turned toward an officiating personality, a bald man about his mid thirties. &quot;What can I do for ya?&quot; He jovially asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you know where I can get spare parts?&quot; Johnson asked.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm your guy.&quot; The man said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Are your prices cheap?&quot; Johnson inquired.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm looking to get rid of all the crap that's filling up in this bay. Takes away room for the ships, you know.&quot; The man said this, attempting to look smart with his second sentence. Such a blatantly obvious fact need not be rubbed in my face, jackass, Johnson thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;You see that pile of junk that Junkers won't take?&quot; Johnson pointed to his ship.
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah? Looks beyond repair if you ask me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I need to fix and make it better than when it was new.&quot;
<br />
<br />The man looked astonished. &quot;Well,... ummm.&quot; The man scratched his head in disbelief. &quot;I.. Never... Don't play jokes on me.&quot; The guy finally said.
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm not joking.&quot; Johnson said that with all seriousness. &quot;Now how much is this going to cost?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Umm,.... I'd say twenty thousand credits. With my prices. In any other place, it'd be up in the hundreds.&quot;
<br />
<br />A very realistic price, Johnson thought. &quot;You Junkers have any high paying odd jobs around the place?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Not that I know of. Check out the bar. To ease your sorrow, not to look for a job.&quot; The man said.
<br />
<br />Johnson walked off. He caught eye of a few Junkers almost sending it to the scrap heap, and he embarassed the hell out of himself telling them to stop.
<br />_________________________________________________________
<br />Inside the bar, Johnson heard rumors that the battleship was going to go to Bretonia, the only place with a limited amount of safety in Sirius. The plan was to leave within two hours, meaning that anyone who wanted to stay in Liberty better get off within that time (OOC: Meaning you Nickless or Lutz <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>. The ship wasn't going to stop for one or two people.
<br />
<br />Johnson pretty much knew how the Junkers would travel and get to Bretonia. From the place they were waiting, behind the Grande Negra, to the California Jumphole. From there, they'd have to make it across a Trade Lane, being clearly visible, to the Cortez Jumphole. They would then attempt to go to Montezuma Base, if it still existed, to repair and get supplies, and then go to Manchester.
<br />
<br />A battleship was a thing that was not easily hideable, so even if they crossed a tradelane, they would've probably been noticed well before that, so it didn't matter really.
<br />
<br />Johnson had two hours to spend.</div>
