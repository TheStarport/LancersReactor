			<div class="content">chapter 1
<br />
<br />Terrick was chlling out in his huge Rhienland fighter. people often said how did he live with himself. he often gave them the releif of not living with themself. he was a nsaty guy to those who crossed him. he carried a arsenal in his ship and was equiped to kill anything. but he was used to fighting humans or a rare alien scout but that was once in a life sort of thing. but he never could imagine fighting what had some sort of control on reality. as far as he knew nothing was more powerful then the barrel of a gun.
<br />
<br />His C.O popped up on the Screen
<br />
<br />&quot;Terrick we got a big job for you. its a big chance for some big money.&quot; his C.O said
<br />
<br />&quot;What is it&quot; Terrick said bluntly
<br />
<br />&quot;well for quite some time now we have been wondering about the dissaperanc of a Recoverer. it gets worse this guy has broke th oath and is using his power over people.&quot; the C.O said
<br />
<br />&quot;is that all&quot; Terrick asked &quot;i could let my little brother do that&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;no&quot; the C.O said &quot; this guy has more power then just over people he seems too be able to... well you'll see&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;i look forward to it&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&quot;oh your team will meet you at...&quot; The C.O said
<br />
<br />&quot;I dont work as a team.&quot; Terrick said &quot;send them to kill someone else.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;okay Terrick over&quot; the C.O said  'oh wait he was last seen in the high end bar on New berlin.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;New berlin is all bars give me a name.&quot; Terrick said 'other wise i will go to the landing pad bar.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;uh... its the QZX&quot; The C.O said
<br />
<br />&quot;hes a dead man&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&quot;good luck&quot; The C.O said &quot;you'll need it.&quot;
<br />
<br />Terrick flew towards new berlin. after a few scans and such he was able to land on new berlin.
<br />he walked off the pad and got in a cab.
<br />
<br />&quot;cabby' he said &quot;you will not be paid i am a hunter on top priorty Goverment mission. now to the QZX.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;eer yes sir&quot; the cabby said
<br />
<br />Terrick got out of the cab, he wlaked up to the door when a bouncer stopped him.
<br />
<br />&quot;hey no one goes in here.!&quot; the bouncer said
<br />
<br />Terrick picked him up by the neck. &quot;if i see you when i get out i kill you. stay out of my way.&quot;
<br />

<br />Terrick dropped the bouncer and pointed a gun at him.
<br />
<br />&quot;im going in okay now you can do your job and die or you can let me in and live. i am a hunter and i can and will kill any security that tries to stop me.&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&quot;y-y-you c-can g-o-o in sir&quot; the bouncer said
<br />
<br />Terrick walked in. it was a typical club, flashing lights dancers bartenders, rich people having a good time. someone cam up to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;hey man. what ya doing wearing those clothis here its a club man&quot; the Man said.
<br />
<br />Terrick like usual grabbed the man by the collar and threw him across the room. none looked at him or the other man. Terrick made his way through the crow. he stopped by the bar and looked at the bar tender with a cold hard stare.
<br />
<br />&quot;hey good sir.&quot; the bartender said &quot;can i get you a drink?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;no.&quot; Terrick said &quot;but you can get me him.&quot; Terrick showed him a picture of the Restorer.
<br />
<br />&quot;oh yes i saw the fellow he is quite.. strange bended metal by staring at it. he went upstairs with company then came back down. when i asked him to pay for everything he twisted up a few of my glasses. but why a hunter looking for him&quot; the bartender said
<br />
<br />&quot;why do Hunters look for people&quot; Terrick said &quot;now do you know were he went?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;he'll be back in a hour. in the mean time are you sure you dont want a drink on the house of course.&quot; the bartender said
<br />

<br />
<br />Terrick waited fr the man ti enter. he drank and watched usual stuff in a club. nothing to exciting. 
<br />Terrick was getting very annoyed with this. he wanted blood his blood or the Restoreres blood. then he sw then man enter. he clooly got up and walked over to the man. without warning he pulled out a rifle and fired a round. the man stared at the lasers stopped in mid air. they turned to little pellets then fell to the ground.
<br />
<br />&quot;how the hell did you...&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />'Terrick you have much to learn&quot; he said
<br />
<br />&quot;you are a rare man&quot; Terrick said &quot;pity i have to kill you&quot;
<br />
<br />Terrix pulled out a knife and lunged at him. but the knife simply turned to hot wax.
<br />
<br />&quot;this is not right&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&quot;prehaps you need a leason of my powers&quot; The man said Terrick flw across the room and hit a wall. the wall molded out and bound him like chains.
<br />he pulled another man over and stared at him. the other man  grabbed his head and slowly fell to the ground. then his head melted to hot metal.
<br />
<br />&quot;i didn't kill you&quot; the Restorer said &quot;becuase you amuse me. now! barkeep bring me you finest.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;not unless you let the Hunter go!&quot; the bartender said
<br />
<br />&quot;well it looks like you have a spine. very well he may be free.&quot; The man said
<br />
<br />the wall binding Terrick melted and he fell to the floor.
<br />
<br />&quot;just becuase you have a few magic tricks doesn't mean i wont kill you some day.&quot; Terrick said.
<br />
<br />&quot;very brave indeed' the man said &quot;you will help me in my plans.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;over my dead body!&quot; Terrick said as he left</div>

			<div class="content">Chapter 4
<br />
<br />Terrick walked out of the bar wondering what had happened
<br />
<br />&#8220;Cab!&#8221; he called.
<br />
<br />A cab pulled up and he got in. it was a old style cab, fancy leather seats. Even cigarettes were there, and cigarettes are a rare delicacy. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yuri Vhan hotel&#8221; Terrick said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Yes sir&#8221; The cab driver said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Terrick leaned back and looked out the window. People walking up and down, unaware of and danger at all. Men with shops in little hills. Police patrolling the street. The Hub of all the colonies. Ships buzzing every were. A wonderful city filled with crime and such. 
<br />
<br />&#8220;Here we are sir.&#8221; The cab driver said, &#8220;That&#8217;s 3.40 credits.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;I am not paying&#8221; Terrick said
<br />
<br />The cab driver didn&#8217;t even stop him, scared of his hunter apparel. He walked into the main lobby of the hotel. You couldn&#8217;t say it was cheap but not too fancy either. Terrick walked up to the front desk. He stared at the worker.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Uh can I help you sir.&#8221;  The worker said.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Room. Now!&#8221; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&#8220;Okay sir that&#8217;s 35.95 credits please&#8221; the worker said
<br />
<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m a hunter I don&#8217;t have to pay.&#8221; Terrick said &#8220;now were is the room.&#8221;
<br />
<br />&#8220;Uh&#8230; government business I assume.&#8221; the worker said &#8216;follow me.&#8221;
<br />
<br />Terrick walked with the worker to his room. He entered it and looked around. T.V bed couch. Terrick fell asleep as son as he lay down.
<br />
<br />&#8220;He woke the next evening, he slept for a whole day because hunters to keep fit (also studies show that sleep deprived people kill more.) Sleep once a week. He got in a cab and took it through the bustling city. He got back out at the club and entered. This time the bouncer didn&#8217;t stop him.
<br />When he entered he stop his target by two other men talking to him at the bar. His target turned to him and looked him in the eye.
<br />
<br />&#8220;I told you to leave well enough alone. Now will make your brain think its feeling pain horribly.&#8221; The man said then he extended his hand at Terrick.
<br />
<br />Terrick continued to walk forward unhindered. The man looked shocked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;Amazing you don&#8217;t feel pain.&#8221; He said
<br />
<br />&#8220;Pain is irrelevant&#8221; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&#8220;what are you&#8221; the man asked.
<br />
<br />&#8220;a living nightmare&#8221; Terrick said</div>

<br />
<br />&quot;nightmares end.&quot; The Restorer said
<br />
<br />&quot;not this one&quot; Terrick said  &quot;but i wil end you&quot;
<br />
<br />Terrick charged at th resorer. he grabbed him and hit him across the face. The restorer pulled out a gun and fired on Terrick. Terrick jumped out of the way and pulled out a foot long knife. He threw it at the man and watched as the knife shattered like glass.
<br />Terrick jumped on the wall and pulled out two guns. He started firing as much as possible. many lasers shatter in mid air but one managed to hit the man. hee was thrown in the air twisted by the pain.
<br />
<br />&quot;you dont know what your getting into , Hunter&quot; He said
<br />
<br />&quot;die you son of a...&quot; Terrick said &quot;Say hello to my gun&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;you poor fool.&quot; He said 
<br />
<br />The walls started to crumble and the cleiling started to fall. Terrick jumped out a window and was falling four stories head first. 
<br />he turned his bodie and grabbed a poll at about the second storie. he jumped in the window and realized that it was also falling apart there.
<br />he jumped down the elavator shaft and grabbed the ledge before he plummeted into the basments. 
<br />he pulled himself up and walked out the door. just as the building colapsed. he never looked back.
<br />
<br />Three police men came up to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;what happened?&quot; a officer asked
<br />
<br />&quot;you saw what happened the building was destroyed and thats all you need to know. i have my own agenda and i am leaving this rock.&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />&quot;we need to know' another officer said
<br />
<br />&quot;i'll get around to sending a message.&quot; Terrick said
<br />
<br />Terrick saw a car and jumped in. He inserted sepcial nanobots that would turn over the system to him. due to the low level sucuriety and this brand of car his bots worked fine. he started tyo drive away.

			<div class="content">Chapter 6
<br />
<br />Terrick walked to his ship on the landing pad. people went in and out of buildings, everything seemed normal. then by his ship he saw to Hunters waiting. Terrick drew his pistol and hid behind a corner. he needed to think about what was happening. The two noticed him, he realzized that they must have Implants in there eyes. Terrick did not beleive in implants, he thought that true Hunters needed only there eye's and ears not gadgits. The two were coming fast on the corner. Terrick climbed a ladder on the wall. Then turned the corner , pistols drawn. Terrick realzizing this was to close for a Fir fight drew his Knife. they looked around still not understanding how he escaped them, they never even bothered to look up.
<br />
<br />Terrick jumped down from the ladder a thrust his knife into one of the hunter's head. The wan's body wobbled back and forth, blood gurgling from his head. he fell over , the other hunter i shock. The other hunter barly had drawn his knife when Terrick slashed down. The Hunter caught Terrick's thrust of the tip of his blade. He swung at Terrick, who deftly jumped aside. The hunter thrust Towards terrick's middle, While Terrick jumped to the right and cliped the other hunter on the head.
<br />
<br />The other hunter jumped onto the ladder and started climbing. Terrick jumped up and grabbed the other's foot. He took his knife and stabbed the foot and twisted the knife. The hunter let out a scream and fell to the ground. Terrick jumped down and was going to plunge his Dagger into the heart of the Hunter, but the Hunter rolled aside, his face a mask of pain.
<br />
<br />Terrick took out his pistol and fired on the man. The was nothing left but a smoking corpse. Terrick ran to his ship and without a moment to lose blasted into the sky. Two hunter ships came at Terrick and opened fire. Terrick did a barrel role still weaving through the city in his ship. The hunters followed and fired torpedos. The torpedos hit a high building a destroyed it. Terrick flew low through the city and popped up from under the ships. he fired a vlley of issiles and lasers.
<br />
<br />One of the hunter ships was destroyed and the other managed to dodge taking little damage. Terrick flew behing a building as lasers went after him. These buildings could strech one mile in the sky so no one on the surface even noticed the fight. Terrick could see people in the building watching and looking at him. they wondered was he the terrorist or was the other the bad guy. there questions were soon answered as the Hunter fired missiles into the building. setting several floors aflame.
<br />
<br />Terrick fired three missiles who flew striaght threw the shattered glass of the building and hit the other ship destroying it. those who were alive in the building cheered. Terrick called a rescue shuttle and flew off.
