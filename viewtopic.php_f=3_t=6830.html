			<div class="content">Some easily implemented Random missions to help counter the problem of repetitiveness.
<br />Anyone may use these ideas freely. Some of these are very similar to current random missions but even a small change can make a huge difference if the &quot;flavor&quot; of a game.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#1 - Contraband
<br />
<br />We of &quot;X&quot; Transport Consortium regularly employ Slicers to detect smugglers. We have become aware of a (small time Level 1, increasingly troublesome Level 2, dangerous Level 3, etc.) smuggler sneaking cargo into Liberty Space to avoid our import taxes. Intercept the (Rhino, Medium Transport, Heavy Transport) and any escorts it has at (Random Location). We don't care if they live or die, just bring the (small, medium, large) quantity of commodities back here to me.
<br />NOTES - Make the cargo valuable enough to tempt the player to keep it and take a (Widely Random) faction penalty with the mission giving faction who wants the cargo. If the cargo isn't delivered then = mission failed status. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#2 - Emergency Rescue
<br />
<br />Long range scanners have detected a distress beacon from an escape pod carrying (Random Elite Person). (Random Elite Person) was able to destroy their transport but the pirate fighters have probably tractored it and are dragging it away at a reduced speed. Get there fast and bring the escape pod back here safetly.
<br />NOTES - Escape Pod should be in the debris of one of the fighters. Give reward if player returns the escape pod AND also give a larger monetary reward AND faction penalty if the player delivers the escape pod to a kind of &quot;neutral&quot; known hangout of the shipjacking pirates.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#3 - Strange Passengers
<br />
<br />My three friends and I heard that you were hiring out your services. We need to get off this planet without any attention and get to (Random Destination). Is your ship fast enough? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />NOTES - The player shouldn't have his locally illegal cargo scanned too aggressively at the mission origin but they should have to deliver the passengers to some appropriately dangerous waypoint or have to pass through heavily policed zones. If the passengers (illegal cargo) are scanned then automatically apply a faction penalty even if the player isn't apprehended.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#4 - One on One
<br />
<br />Hey there. I heard you're gun is for sale. There's a bounty hunter after me and I want him taken care of. I've tricked him into thinking I'm at (Random Location). Go there and kill him and I'll pay you a truckload.
<br />NOTES - This mission should only count as a small penalty against the bounty hunter faction since they can only suspect the player and not prove his guilt. It should pay a lot and there should only be one ship to attack but it should be pretty tough since there is only one. This is kind of like the fight between Jango Fett and Obi Wan.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /># 5 - Station attack - don't know if this is even possible
<br />
<br />I've discovered the location of a secret space station at (random destination) after &quot;interrogating&quot; a pirate I captured in an escape pod. He told me the station has (random commodity) and only keeps a handful of fighters on alert. He also told me that the station has a weakness, an exhaust port that if I fire into will cause the whole thing to blow and send the cargo drifting in space for me to pick up.
<br />NOTE - The station doesn't have to be very big but it has to be indestructible unless a small target on it(exhaust port) takes sufficient damage. It should have turrets and about 4-5 fighters circling it. When one fighter is destroyed another should replace it so the only way to win is to hit the small target. ala deathstar
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#6 - Nail the escaping ships
<br />
<br />(Appropriate Powerful Organization) We have discovered a rebel base on (Random remote planet). They are fleeing under the cover of a powerful ground based cannon that can easily target our large battleships so we have to use fighters. Destroying their transports is your first priority and watch out for the ground based cannon.
<br />NOTES - This should take place near a planet. There should be 2-4 large and powerful laser beams firing over and over but in the exact same direction creating a laser &quot;alley&quot; for the rebel transports to follow away from the planet to a nearby hyperspace lane. The player stays clear of the large but predictable laser beams and strafes the transports while being attacked by rebel fighter escorts. ala escape from Hoth
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#7 - Ground forces - don't know if this is possible
<br />
<br />Attack advancing ground forces like tanks on the surface of some large space body like a planet or station.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />#8 - Hide and surprise attack in an asteroid field - requires a new graphic though simple
<br />
<br />Use large asteroids to vanquish some more powerful foes. 
<br />NOTES - Player goes to a way point in the middle of an asteroid field. There should be 5-6 very large asteroids with a large hole/tunnel that can be flown into. Then you can stop and fire at ships from the safety of the asteroid. The enemies should be tough to counter balance the strategy but the rewards should be greater too.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I might add more ideas to this post later. Some of these ideas may be in the final version. One final note is that I think it is important to make the player feel like they are making a difference for whatever factions they work for/help often. To this effect I suggest a simple economic power ranking shown on the reputation pop up window which is modified a little or a lot depending on the level of your missions. Even if none of these changes can be implemented now, it's good to discuss for future games.</div>

			<h3><a href="#p83177" class="post-subject"></a></h3>

			

			<div class="content">These are all very good ideas.  They shouldn't be very hard to omplement some of them due to them not straying very far from the &quot;kill missions&quot; that are already in place.  The ground targets thing would be out since there is no rendered planet surface to be found in the game (well other than the place your ship lands, but you can't move around there, so you get my point).  
<br />
<br />There is already a station attack mission of sorts where they tell you that some hostile group has built a station in a certain place and you need to go destroy it.
<br />
<br />Having missions even as simple as excorting passengers can be good if who the passengers are are a surprise.  For example, you just might have regular people wanting to come on board.  Nothing beyond the random events that occur when travelling through the galaxy will occur.  Sometimes, the passengers are fugitives and the police might do a scan on you and alert you to their presence.  Or, they may have bounties on their heads which will bring on thebounty hunters.  By not letting you know who they are, an element of surprise is there because you are taking some risks by taking these passengers.  Anyway, that is just an idea I had about missions.
<br />
<br />One other idea for a mission would be for you to go find something and not have them tell you exactly where it is like they do in current missions.  Maybe they tell you to go to an area and scan the ships to find a particular one to hunt down.  Or, they tell you someone is in a system (pretty large area) and you have to find them yourself.  Or maybe you are ordered to follow some ship somewhere and spy on them to see what they are up to or gather evidence.
<br />
<br />There are lots of random mission types you could create which would give the players much more of a sense of a plot of some sort and not just the few types they have.  Sure, they will all eventually get repetitive the longer you play, but if you have more types to begin with, it will take longer for that to happen.</div>

			<div class="content">Those are some pretty good ideas. I don't know about the exhaust port one though, too much of a Star Wars ripoff. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle> Hopefully the random missions will either be easy to add content to with a patch or maybe even the mod people can figure out a way to edit/add to the random missions files.
<br />
<br />The game has many strengths but the lack of variety in the random missions can be considered a weakness. The game is still fun the way it is but I think the added variety will add to the enjoyability of the game. I never got to play privateer 1, but I remember privateer 2 having various mission type choices.
<br />
<br />Another feature I thought was cool in privateer 2 was the distress beacon. I remember being out in space and the beacon lighting up and having somebody request for assitance. It was my choice to take the mission or not but it added to the impressiveness.</div>

			<div class="content">Yeah, some good ideas there.   I also like DJ's idea of not telling you where the prey is.  I remember Privateer missions would tell you that so-and-so is in such-and-such system, but not tell you <i>where </i> in that system.  It was pretty fun having to go hunting.  It'd also add to the realism if the guy didn't know you were after him, so he might actually be friendly to you until you start pounding his hull. <img src=smilies/icon_smile.gif width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>
<br />
<br />I also liked the idea of going after escaping ships.  Since NPC ships already have trajectories, it should be pretty easy to code in.  I imagine they'd be going faster than normal, though, and you'd have to catch them before they docked at where ever they were headed for.
<br />
<br />Helping militia out in larger skirmishes with pirates would also be nice (this isn't already in the game, is it?).
<br />
<br />Making a patrol run, a la Privateer, also seems relatively easy to implement.
<br />
<br />What else...what else...I'll come back with more.</div>

			<div class="content">The distress beacon idea is very cool.  ANother good thing would have been to just have scnarios hidden out in space.  For instance, you are just cruising around in some unexplored area and you stumble across fighters attacking a freighter.  You kill them all, you get money.  Or, you stumble across someone who broke down and they eject out of their ship and you tractor them in and take them where they want to go.  Or you find a derelict ship with some kind of important data on it.  When you scan the ship you read some logs talking about how this data was very important and who it needed to get to.  You accept, it gets put on board and you deliver it.
<br />
<br />These kinds of mission would encourage exploration and you would get paid.  They would be one time only deals, but they would just be out there waiting you to stumble across this one area inb a whole system.
<br />
<br />One can hope these types of things appear in expansions.</div>
