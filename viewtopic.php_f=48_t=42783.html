			<div class="content">Me and a few friends are pretty good coders, and a few of us are artists, but none of us are any good at gmax or lightwave. We also have this problem with textures. Our textures just simply fail. We have read and followed pretty much every tutorial out there, but it just doesn't work out for us. We would really like to have someone who has some expereince at gmax or lightwave, as well as textures create some ships for us.
<br />
<br />We are trying to create new systems, and add some new ships, as well as put in new jump effects for now. We are aiming at a Total Conversion mod, but we want to get this working for now at least. I have only uploaded one of the pictures to my computer, and if the artists only want to do one model, that is fine, we would just enjoy some people to help us out and create some models for us. If you just want to create the model and the texture, that is fine, but it would be appreiciated if you went all the way and coded the hardpoints. Rest Assured we would include any people who created ships for us when we create the mod. 
<br />
<br />The ship we have a picture of is called the Dark Legionaire. (If I mispelled that, sorry. English was never my strong suit) I cannot emphasize enough how great it would be to have that done. The texture would be dark grey metal. If anyone is willing to create the hardpoints, you should be able to see the engines, and I don't know if you can get the guns to look right, since I don't like the look of them sticking out of the tubes at the end of the wings. If you can do that, I would praise you as a god, if you can't it would still be great if you could just put three guns on each wings. (The guns are supposed to be the tubes at the edges of the wings) As I said before, If someone would do the hardpoints, the actuall moddeling, and the texture that would be wonderful.

<br />
<br />(Note: If you want to see somewhat of an idea for the future of this mod, look at earth-4275.tripod.com, it will probably take a while for us to do a total converison, but right now we are working in small steps towards an ultimate goal)
<br />
<br />Thanks
