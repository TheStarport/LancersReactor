			<div class="content">Years ago...  (God, has it been that long...) I was involved in a &quot;web story&quot; with a bunch of people around the Xwing/Tie Fighter series of games from Lucas Arts.  I was General Rowder.  We invented things like freighter/capital ships, fighter docks, a minefield contest and some other stuff that Lucas Arts used in their later releases of the game add-ons, such as Bwing and others.  We co-wrote a rather long story that lasted for months on the old Compuseve network.  It was one of the best times I ever had.  I wish I still had the whole story, but that disk died a long time ago.  You can have a good time with this if you do it right.

<br />Also, when the game starts, anybody and everybody please feel free to use my character within their stories, so long as you keep me in character (Don't have me killing innocent ships for example) and obviously don't kill me.
<br />My ship: I've seen several peeps do a &quot;Modified&quot; version of their ships. That's what I'll do too.
<br />Defender-XE (Working name, prototype ship): Latest ship designed by the Liberty Navy out in Alaska. 5 Gunmounts, 1 turrets (Same as Defender then) optimal class is 9, max 10. Can carry torps, mines and Adv CM. Armour rating is about 7000, manouevability is same as Eagle. New prototype powerplant, take 8 seconds to recharge. New prototype weapon, particle disruptor. Can only be fired for 2 seconds before powerplant drains. Totally and utterly useless against shields. Destroys all matter it touches.

<br />
<br />Name: Michael Armstrong
<br />Shipname: Nova Sailor
<br />Shipclass: Falcon
<br />
<br />Profile: As the son of a mineworker, he grew up in the poor part of Manhattan. Determined to make himself a career he starts as a trainee at West Point Academy. As a prommesing fighter pilot, he soon gains command of his own patrol. After a Rogue hunt into the badlands, he loses all his wingmen and returns to West Point where he is being held responsible for the failed oparation and centenced to 10 years of hard labour in the mines of ... (can't think of a good place here, but I will get back on it) He manages to escape by stealing a Falcon, but killing a guard and a hunting party. Being on the run, he found himself a save haven at Mactan, where he has been for several years now.
<br />
<br />Attitude: Trying to stay neutral, but still a wanted criminal by the Liberty authorities. 
<br />Loyal to his friends, he'll never rat one out or double-cross anyone. He's always looking for a good deal, wich sometimes get's him in a difficult situation.
<br />Although he is part of a pirate organisation (Lane Hackers) he doesn't act as a pirate, more like a trader. His non agressional attitude, in combination with a strong sence for justice earned him the nickname The Judge. But dispite this passive standing, he's still a pilot to be reconed with.
<br />
<br />PS: His above average flying skills don't require a modded ship <img src='./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' width=15 height=15 border=0 align=middle>

<br />
<br /><b>Personal History:      </b>
<br />
<br />Connor Almasy was born on Denver from Lynn Marcella Almasy-Brenner, an interior decorator who died a few minutes after Connor's birth because of complications and Thomas Reginald Almasy, Executive Vice-President of Ageira Technologies, which has a head office situated on Denver. When Conner was 15 years old, Thomas R. Almasy finally died from an incurable disease he had been struggling with for years. Soon after the funeral, Conner went to live on Cambridge with his uncle, who became Conner&#180;s guardian, because he was still a minor. His uncle, William (Bill) S. Almasy had a Ph.D. in engineering from the prestigious Cambridge University and was working for the Liberty Navy, spaceship engineering over at the Norfolk Shipyard. He taught Connor everything about the technology of all kinds of spacecrafts (freighters, fighters etc.), including building them. His uncle strangely disappeared a few years later. Not a soul in known space knows what happened to him or the reason for his disappearance. In the meanwhile, Conner had to make it on his own and therefore went into martial arts training to learn the art of hand to hand combat and flight simulation. After months of intensive training, he decided to work for himself and become a Freelancer. He &#180;acquired&#180; an Anubis fighter on a remote station in the Border Worldsk, modified it extensively and took on some missions. He quickly learned how Freelancers deal with certain situations &quot; kill or be killed ! &quot;. As his skills grew so did his reputation and kills. Because of that, he was soon known as &#180;Eraser&#180;, because he mercilessly &quot;erases&quot; his enemies from existence...

			<div class="content">Character Name: Johann Schmidt
<br />
<br />Ship Name: Ursala
<br />
<br />Ship Class: 203-ARKM-B5 Humpback Freighter
<br />
<br />Background: Johann is the youngest son of one of New Berlin's wealthiest merchants. His father, Albrecht Schmidt, was killed in a terrorist attack by the Unioners. After it became clear to him that his older brother would receive the lion's share of his father's commercial empire Johann threatened to file suit to get what he felt was his fair share of the inheritance. His brother, fearing the bad publicity a court battle could cause, begrudgingly offered Johann a position in the company, but Johann, seeing an opportunity to start a commercial empire of his own, responded by asking to take ownership of one of the fully loaded Humpback freighters in the company fleet. His brother, fearing competition, agreed on the condition that Johann would not be allowed return to Rheinland space for 10 years.
<br />
<br />Johann typically runs cargo between Liberty and Bretonian space specializing in Luxury Foods and Engine Components. Due to his neutrality with the Corsairs, he will occasionally run Alien Artifacts for select clients.
<br />
<br />Alignment: Chaotic Good (Doesn't respect or trust House Security Forces. Has been known to organize convoys with less established traders to show them the ropes.)
